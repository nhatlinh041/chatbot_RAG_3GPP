      "content": "For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in 3GPP TR 21.905 [1], 3GPP TS 23.501 [3] and the following apply. A term defined in the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in 3GPP TR 21.905 [1].\nBinding indication (consumer): Binding can be used by the NF Service Consumer to indicate suitable NF Service Consumer instance(s) for notification target instance selection, reselection and routing of subsequent notification requests associated with a specific notification subscription. Binding indication needs to be stored by the NF Service Producer. Binding indication may also be used later if the NF Service Consumer starts acting as NF Service Producer, so that service requests can be sent to this NF Service Producer. See clauses 3.1 and 6.3.1.0 in 3GPP TS 23.501 [3]. See also Routing binding indication.\nBinding indication (producer): Binding can be used to indicate suitable target NF Service Producer instance(s) for an NF service instance selection, reselection and routing of subsequent requests associated with a specific NF Service Producer resource (context) and NF service. Binding allows the NF Service Producer to indicate to the NF Service Consumer if a particular context should be bound to an NF service instance, NF instance, NF service set or NF set. Binding indication needs to be stored by the NF Service Consumer. See clauses 3.1 and 6.3.1.0 in 3GPP TS 23.501 [3]. See also Routing binding indication.\nBinding entity: Either of the following identifiers: NF Service Instance, NF Service Set, NF Instance or an NF Set. The relation between these are explained below.\nBinding entity ID: An identification of a binding entity, i.e. NF Service Instance ID, NF Service Set ID, NF Instance ID or an NF set ID.\nBinding level: A parameter (bl) in \"3gpp-Sbi-Routing-Binding\" and \"3gpp-Sbi-Binding\" HTTP custom headers, which indicates the binding entity towards which a preferred binding exists (i.e. either to NF Service Instance, NF Service Set, NF Instance or an NF Set). Other binding entities in these headers, which do not correspond to the binding level indicate alternative binding entities that can be reselected and that share the same resource contexts (see Table 6.3.1.0-1 in 3GPP TS 23.501 [3]).\nCallback URI: URI to be used by an NF Service Producer to send notification or callback requests.\nEndpoint address: An address in the format of an IP address, transport and port information, or FQDN, which is used to determine the host/authority part of the target URI. This Target URI is used to access an NF service (i.e. to invoke service operations) of an NF service producer or for notifications to an NF service consumer. See clauses 3.1 and 6.3.1.0 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [3].\nNF Instance: An identifiable instance of the NF. An NF Instance may provide services offered by one or more NF Service instances.\nNF Service Instance: An identifiable instance of the NF service.\nNF Service Set: A group of interchangeable NF service instances of the same service type within an NF instance. The NF service instances in the same NF Service Set have access to the same context data.\nNF Set: A group of interchangeable NF instances of the same type, supporting the same services and the same Network Slice(s). The NF instances in the same NF Set may be geographically distributed but have access to the same context data.\nNotification endpoint: Notification endpoint is a destination URI of the network entity where the notification is sent. See clause 6.3.1.0 in 3GPP TS 23.501 [3].\nRouting binding indication: Information included in a request or notification and that can be used by the SCP for discovery and associated selection to of a suitable target. See clauses 3.1, 6.3.1.0 and 7.1.2 in 3GPP TS 23.501 [3]. Routing binding indication has similar syntax as a binding indication, but it has different purpose. Routing binding indication provides the receiver (i.e. SCP) with information enabling to route an HTTP request to an HTTP server that can serve the request. Routing binding indication is not stored by the receiver.",

This header should be included in every HTTP/2 request sent over any SBI; This header shall be included in every HTTP/2 request sent using indirect communication when target NF (re-)selection is to be performed at SCP.\nFor Indirect communications, the User-Agent header in a request that is:\n-\tforwarded by the SCP (with or without delegated discovery) shall identify the NF type of the original NF that issued the request (i.e. the SCP shall forward the header received in the incoming request);\n-\toriginated by the SCP towards the NRF (e.g. NF Discovery or Access Token Request) shall identify the SCP.\nThe pattern of the content should start with the value of NF type (e.g. \"UDM\", see NOTE 1) or \"SCP\" (for a request originated by an SCP) and followed by a \"-\" and any other specific information if needed afterwards.\nCache-Control\nIETF RFC 9111 [20]\nThis header may be used in some HTTP/2 requests to provide the HTTP cache-control directives that the client is willing to accept from the server.\nIf-Modified-Since\nIETF RFC 9110 [11]\nThis header may be used in a conditional GET request, for server revalidation. This is used in conjunction with the Last-Modified server response header, to fetch content only if the content has been modified from the cached version.\nIf-None-Match\nIETF RFC 9110 [11]\nThis header may be used in a conditional GET request. This is used in conjunction with the ETag server response header, to fetch content only if the tag value of the resource on the server differs from the tag value in the If-None-Match header.\nIf-Match\nIETF RFC 9110 [11]\nThis header may be used in a conditional POST or PUT or DELETE or PATCH request. This is used in conjunction with the ETag server response header, to update / delete content only if the tag value of the resource on the server matches the tag value in the If-Match header.\nVia\nIETF RFC 9110 [11]\nThis header shall be inserted by HTTP proxies and it shall be inserted by an SCP and SEPP when relaying an HTTP request.\nWhen inserted by an SCP or SEPP, the header field value should be formatted as defined for the Via header in Table 5.2.2.2-2.\nAuthorization\nIETF RFC 9110 [11]\nThis header shall be used if OAuth 2.0 based access authorization with \"Client Credentials\" grant type is used as specified in clause 13.4.1 of 3GPP TS  33.501 [17], clause 7 of IETF RFC 6749 [22] and IETF RFC 6750 [23].\nNOTE 1:\tThe value of NF type in the User-Agent header shall comply with the enumeration value (case insensitive) of Table 6.1.6.3.3-1 in 3GPP TS 29.510 [8].\nTable 5.2.2.2-2: Mandatory to support HTTP response standard headers\nName\nReference\nDescription\nContent-Length\nIETF RFC 9110 [11]\nThis header may be used to provide the anticipated size, as a decimal number of octets, for a potential content.\nContent-Type\nIETF RFC 9110 [11]\nThis header shall be used to indicate the media type of the associated representation.\nLocation\nIETF RFC 9110 [11]\nThis header may be used in some responses to refer to a specific resource in relation to the response.\nRetry-After\nIETF RFC 9110 [11]\nThis header may be used in some responses to indicate how long the user agent ought to wait before making a follow-up request.\nContent-Encoding\nIETF RFC 9110 [11]\nThis header may be used in some responses to indicate to the HTTP/2 client the content encodings (e.g. gzip) applied to the resource representation beyond those inherent in the media type.\nCache-Control\nIETF RFC 9111 [20]\nThis header may be used in some responses (e.g. NRF responses to queries) to provide HTTP response cache control directives. The cache directives \"no-cache\", \"no-store\", \"max-age\" and \"must-revalidate\" values shall be supported.\nAge\nIETF RFC 9111 [20]\nThis header may be inserted by HTTP proxies when returning a cached response. The \"Age\" header field conveys the sender's estimate of the amount of time since the response was generated or successfully validated at the origin server. The presence of an Age header field implies that the response was not generated or validated by the origin server for this request.\nLast-Modified\nIETF RFC 9110 [11]\nThis header may be sent to allow for conditional GET with the If-Modified-Since header.\nETag\nIETF RFC 9110 [11]\nThis header may be sent to allow for conditional GET with the If-If-None-Match header or a conditional POST / PUT / PATCH / DELETE with the If-Match header.\nVia\nIETF RFC 9110 [11]\nThis header shall be inserted by HTTP proxies.\nThis header shall be inserted by an SCP or SEPP when relaying an HTTP error response (see clause 6.10.8). It may be inserted when relaying other HTTP responses.\nWhen inserted by an SCP or SEPP, the received-protocol portion of the header field value should be set to \"HTTP/2.0\" or \"2.0\" and the received-by portion of the header field value should be formatted as follows:\n- \"SCP-<SCP FQDN>\" for an SCP\n- \"SEPP-<SEPP FQDN>\" for a SEPP\nSee examples in clause 6.10.8.\nAllow\nIETF RFC 9110 [11]\nThis header field shall be used to indicate methods supported by the target resource.\nWWW-Authenticate\nIETF RFC 9110 [11]\nThis header field shall be included when an NF service producer rejects a request with a \"401 Unauthorized\" status code (e.g. when a request is sent without an OAuth 2.0 access token or with an invalid OAuth 2.0 access token).\nAccept-Encoding\nIETF RFC 9110 [11]\nSee clause 6.9 for the use of this header.\nServer\nIETF RFC 9110 [11]\nThis header should be inserted by the originator of an HTTP error response (see clause 6.10.8).

More than one servname parameter may be present to represent multiple such services. The absence of this parameter in a Binding Indication with the scope parameter set to \"other-service\" shall be interpreted as binding information that applies to all the services that the NF Service Consumer may provide later as an NF Service Producer.\n-\trecoverytime: indicates the recovery timestamp of the entity corresponding to the highest resiliency level supported for the resource, that is, the higher level binding entity indicated in the Binding Indication. See Table 6.3.1.0-1 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [3] and clause 6.1 of 3GPP TS 23.527 [38]. The date-time type is specified in IETF RFC 5322 [37] and clause 5.6.7 of IETF RFC 9110 [11].\n-\tnr: indicates the URI of the notification endpoint when this binding information is applicable; it applies to callback requests (see clause 6.12.4); if the notification URI does not contain a correlationID in the path (i.e. it is a common notification URI for multiple subscriptions), the correlationID shall be added as a fragment component of the URI (i.e. following the \"#\" character) at the end of the URI.\n-\tfor the definition and encoding of the blvalue, nfinst, backupamfinst, nfset, nfservinst and nfserviceset see clause 5.2.3.2.5.\n-\tbackupnf: indicates the backup NF service instance identifier and/or the backup NF identifier as defined in clause 5.2.2.2.2 or in 3GPP TS 29.510 [8], which shall be used when preferred binding entity is not reachable if supported.\n-\tgroup: it is a boolean indicating if the binding indication is for a group of resource/session contexts.\n-\tgroupid (group id): indicates the group identifier allocated by the NF (service) instance, one ore more resource/session contexts are sharing the same groupid. The groupid is optional and it may be allocated when the resource/session context is created and then be updated afterwards. The groupid is global unique and it may be encoded using the same mechnaism for the NfInstanceId as specificed in 3GPP TS 29.571 [13].\n-\toldgroupid (old group id): indicates the group identifier allocated by the NF (service) instance previously and to be replaced by the groupid, hence it shall only be present when to update a Binding Indication for multiple contexts.  When the if the oldgroupid is present, the groupid shall also be present to indicate the new groupid allocated.\n-\turibase: identify the apiroot and path segments part in the resource URI or notification/callback URI which is common to multiple contexts. This parameter may only be present when to update a Binding Indication for multiple contexts and when the \"group\" is set to \"true\". When included, it indicates that all resources or notification contexts with this uribase will use the updated Binding Indication subsequently. More than one uribase may be present.\n-\toldnfinst: indicates the NF Instance ID of the NF instance where the group of resource/session contexts are currently served (i.e. the Binding Indication allocated previously for the group of resource/session contexts includes the information of the NF instance), as defined in clause 5.2.2.2.2 in 3GPP TS 29.510 [8]. When included, it indicates that all the resource/session contexts served by this NF instance will use the updated Binding Indication subsequently.\n-\toldservset: indicates the NF Service Set ID of the NF Service Set where the group of resource/session contexts are currently served (i.e. the Binding Indication allocated previously for the group of resource/session contexts includes the information of the NF Service Set), as defined in clause 5.2.2.2.2 in 3GPP TS 29.510 [8]. When included, it indicates that all the resource/session contexts served by this NF Service Set will use the updated Binding Indication subsequently.\n-\toldservinst: indicates the NF Service Instance ID of the NF service instance where the group of resource/session contexts are currently served (i.e. the Binding Indication allocated previously for the group of resource/session contexts includes the information of the NF service instance), as defined in clause 5.2.2.2.2 in 3GPP TS 29.510 [8]. When included, it indicates that all the resource/session contexts served by this NF service instance will use the updated Binding Indication subsequently.\n-\tguami (GUAMI): indicates the GUAMI of the AMF currently serving UE contexts, as defined in clause 5.3.4.1 of 3GPP TS 29.571 [13]. When included, it indicates that all the UE contexts associated with the GUMAI will use the updated Binding Indication subsequently.\n-\tno-redundancy: it is a boolean set to true indicating that the resource is exclusively bound to the NF service instance identified in the binding indication. It may be present in a binding with any scope, i.e. \"other-service\", \"subscription-events\" or \"callback\", or with no scope parameter. When this parameter is present, the blvalue shall be set to \"nfservice-instance\", the nfservinst parameter shall be present and either the nfserviceset parameter or the nfinst parameter shall be present. The nfserviceset or nfinst parameter included in the binding indication shall only be used to identify the NF service instance and shall not be considered as a binding entity for reselection. The no-redundancy parameter shall only be signaled if the receiver of this information is known to support this parameter (see clause 6.12.1). Subsequently, when sending further requests targeting a resource with no-redundancy, the HTTP client shall not include any routing binding indication in the request message (to prevent the SCP from performing any reselection).\n-\tcallback-uri-prefix: The NF service consumer may include this parameter when providing a Callback URI when the Callback URI contains a prefix. When present, the \"callback-uri-prefix\" shall be a path-absolute as specified IETF RFC 3986 [14] (i.e. the first path segment(s) after the authority) which is part of the Callback URI provided by a NF service consumer in the corresponding service request message sent to a NF service producer. The authority and \"callback-uri-prefix\" in the Callback URI shall uniquely identify a consumer service instance. This parameter is relevant when the \"scope\" parameter is either \"subscription-events\" or  \"callback\". See clauses 6.12.4 and 6.12.5 for the usage of this parameter. The ABNF is defined in clause 5.2.3.3.7.\nEXAMPLES 1 to 5:\tSame as EXAMPLES 1 to 5 defined in clause 5.2.3.2.5, with the header name \"3gpp-Sbi-Binding\" instead of \"3gpp-Sbi-Routing-Binding\".\nEXAMPLE 6:\tSubscription request from one NF on behalf of another NF, with 2 binding indications:3gpp-Sbi-Binding: bl=nf-set;

They contain discovery parameters to be conveyed by an NF service consumer or an NF service producer to the SCP or by an SCP to the next hop SCP and they shall be used by the SCP to select or reselect a suitable NF service producer instance to create or update a (existing) resource context, or a suitable NF service consumer instance towards which to send a notification or a callback request, e.g. by performing the NF service discovery procedure with the NRF on behalf of the NF consumer in case of indirect communication with delegated discovery model.\nThe name of each NF service discovery factors header shall be constructed by concatenating the string \"3gpp-Sbi-Discovery-\" with the name of the conveyed discovery parameter, i.e. \"3gpp-Sbi-Discovery-<discovery parameter>\".\nThe discovery headers shall be used to include any of the discovery query parameters listed in 3GPP TS 29.510 [8], Table 6.2.3.2.3.1-1.

      "content": "A NF acting as an HTTP server shall be able to generate HTTP status codes specified in clause 5.2.7.1 per indicated HTTP method.\nA request using an HTTP method which is not supported by any resource of a given 5GC SBI API shall be rejected with the HTTP status code \"501 Not Implemented\".\nNOTE 1:\tIn this case, the NF does not need to include in the HTTP response the \"cause\" attribute indicating corresponding error since the HTTP status code \"501 Not Implemented\" itself provides enough information of the error, i.e. the NF does not recognize the HTTP method.\nIf the specified target resource does not exist, the NF shall reject the HTTP method with the HTTP status code \"404 Not Found\".\nIf the NF supports the HTTP method for several resources in the API, but not for the target resource of a given HTTP request, the NF shall reject the request with the HTTP status code \"405 Method Not Allowed\" and shall include in the response an Allow header field containing the supported method(s) for that resource.\nNOTE 2:\tIn this case, the NF does not need to include in the HTTP response the \"cause\" attribute indicating corresponding error since the HTTP status code \"405 Method Not Allowed\" itself provides enough information of the error and hence the Allow header field lists HTTP method(s) supported by the target resource.\nIf a received HTTP request contains unknown IEs, i.e. Information Elements within the JSON body, the NF may discard such IEs and shall process the rest of the request message, unless the schema definition of the received message prohibits the presence of additional IEs or constrains their types. There are cases (e.g. Nnrf_NFManagement API) where the receiver of certain HTTP requests needs to process unknown IEs (e.g. to store in NRF an NF Profile containing vendor-specific attributes, and send them in NFDiscovery results).\nIf a received HTTP request contains IEs or query parameters not compliant with the schema defined in the corresponding OpenAPI specification, the NF should reject the request with the appropriate error code, e.g. \"400 Bad Request (INVALID_MSG_FORMAT)\", even when the failed IEs are defined as optional by the schema.\nIf a received HTTP PATCH request contains a body with modification instruction(s) for unknown attribute(s) in addition to modification instruction(s) for known attribute(s), the NF shall:\na)\timplement all the modification(s) for known attribute(s) and unknown attribute(s) if explicitly specified in the corresponding specification of the API; or\nb)\totherwise, implement the modification(s) for known attribute(s) and discard those modification instruction(s) for unknown attribute(s). The NF may additionally indicate in the response the result of the execution of the PATCH request, i.e. which modification(s) are implemented and/or which modification(s) are discarded, using the \"PatchResult\" JSON object as defined in 3GPP TS 29.571 [13].\nIf the NF supports the HTTP method by a target resource but the NF cannot successfully fulfil the received request, the following requirements apply.\nA NF as HTTP Server should map status codes to the most similar 3xx/4xx/5xx HTTP status code specified in table 5.2.7.1-1. If no such code is applicable, it should use \"400 Bad Request\" status code for errors caused by client side or \"500 Server Internal Error\" status code for errors caused on server side.\nIf the received HTTP request contains unsupported content format, the NF shall reject the HTTP request with the HTTP status code \"415 Unsupported Media Type\". If the HTTP PATCH method is rejected due to unsupported patch document, the NF shall include the Accept-Patch header field set to the value of supported patch document media types for a target resource i.e. to \"application/merge-patch+json\" if the NF supports \"JSON Merge Patch\" and to \"application/json-patch+json\" if the NF supports \"JSON Patch\". If the received HTTP PATCH request contains both \"JSON Merge Patch\" and \"JSON Patch\" documents and the NF supports only one of them, the NF shall ignore unsupported patch document.\nNOTE 3:\tThe format problem might be due to the request's indicated Content-Type or Content-Encoding header fields, or as a result of inspecting the content directly.\nIf the received HTTP request contains content larger than the NF is able to process, the NF shall reject the HTTP request with the HTTP status code \"413 Content Too Large\".\nIf the result of the received HTTP POST request used for a resource creation would be equivalent to the existing resource, the NF shall reject the HTTP request with the HTTP status code \"303 See Other\" and shall include in the HTTP response a Location header field set to the URI of the existing resource.\nProtocol and application errors common to several 5GC SBI API specifications for which the NF shall include in the HTTP response content a \"ProblemDetails\" data structure or application specific error data structure with the \"cause\" attribute indicating corresponding error are listed in table 5.2.7.2-1.\nTable 5.2.7.2-1: Protocol and application errors common to several 5GC SBI API specifications (HTTP server)\nProtocol or application Error\nHTTP status code\nDescription\nINVALID_API\n400 Bad Request\nThe HTTP request contains an unsupported API name or API version in the URI.\nINVALID_MSG_FORMAT\n400 Bad Request\nThe HTTP request has an invalid format.\nINVALID_QUERY_PARAM\n400 Bad Request\nThe HTTP request contains an unsupported query parameter in the URI. (NOTE 1)\nMANDATORY_QUERY_PARAM_INCORRECT\n400 Bad Request\nA mandatory query parameter, or a conditional query parameter but mandatory required, for an HTTP method was received in the URI with semantically incorrect value. (NOTE 1)\nOPTIONAL_QUERY_PARAM_INCORRECT\n400 Bad Request\nAn optional query parameter for an HTTP method was received in the URI with a semantically incorrect value that prevents successful processing of the service request. (NOTE 1)\nMANDATORY_QUERY_PARAM_MISSING\n400 Bad Request\nQuery parameter which is defined as mandatory, or as conditional but mandatory required, for an HTTP method is not included in the URI of the request. (NOTE 1)\nMANDATORY_IE_INCORRECT\n400 Bad Request\nA mandatory IE (within the JSON body or within a variable part of an \"apiSpecificResourceUriPart\" or within an HTTP header), or conditional IE but mandatory required, for an HTTP method was received with a semantically incorrect value. (NOTE 1)\nOPTIONAL_IE_INCORRECT\n400 Bad Request\nAn optional IE (within the JSON body or within an HTTP header) for an HTTP method was received with a semantically incorrect value that prevents successful processing of the service request. (NOTE 1)\nMANDATORY_IE_MISSING\n400 Bad Request\nA mandatory IE (within the JSON body or within the variable part of an \"apiSpecificResourceUriPart\" or within an HTTP header), or conditional IE but mandatory required, for an HTTP method is not included in the request. (NOTE 1)\nUNSPECIFIED_MSG_FAILURE\n400 Bad Request\nThe request is rejected due to unspecified client error. (NOTE 2)\nACCESS_TOKEN_CLAIM_MISSING\n401 Unauthorized\nThe request is rejected due to one or more missing claim(s) in the OAuth2.0 access token.\nRESOURCE_CONTEXT_NOT_FOUND\n400 Bad Request\nThe notification request is rejected because the callback URI still exists in the receiver of the notification, but the specific resource context identified within the notification content is not found in the NF service consumer.\nCCA_VERIFICATION_FAILURE\n403 Forbidden\nThe request is rejected due to a failure to verify the 3gpp-Sbi-Client-Credentials at the receiving entity (e.g. NRF or NF service producer).\nSOURCE_NF_CCA_VERIFICATION_FAILURE\n403 Forbidden\nThe request is rejected due to a failure to verify the 3gpp-Sbi-Source-NF-Client-Credentials at the receiving entity (e.g. NRF or NF service producer).\nTOKEN_CCA_MISMATCH\n403 Forbidden\nThe request is rejected due to a mismatch between the subject claim in the access token and subject claim in the 3gpp-Sbi-Client-Credentials .\nTOKEN_SOURCE_NF_CCA_MISMATCH\n403 Forbidden\nThe request is rejected due to a mismatch between the sourceNfInstanceId claim in the access token and subject claim in the 3gpp-Sbi-Source-NF-Client-Credentials.\nMODIFICATION_NOT_ALLOWED\n403 Forbidden\nThe request is rejected because the contained modification instructions attempt to modify IE which is not allowed to be modified.\nMISSING_PARAMETER\n403 Forbidden\nThe request is rejected because one or more information elements of the requester required to authorize the requester are missing. (NOTE 1)\nSUBSCRIPTION_NOT_FOUND\n404 Not Found\nThe request for modification or deletion of a subscription, or the notification request, is rejected because the subscription is not found in the NF.\nRESOURCE_URI_STRUCTURE_NOT_FOUND\n404 Not Found\nThe request is rejected because a fixed part after the first variable part of an \"apiSpecificResourceUriPart\" (as defined in clause 4.4.1 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [5]) is not found in the NF.\nThis fixed part of the URI may represent a sub-resource collection (e.g. contexts, subscriptions, policies) or a custom operation. (NOTE 5)\nINCORRECT_LENGTH\n411 Length Required\nThe request is rejected due to incorrect value of a Content-length header field.\nNF_CONGESTION_RISK\n429 Too Many Requests\nThe request is rejected due to excessive traffic which, if continued over time, may lead to (or may increase) an overload situation of the NF instance. (NOTE 7)\nNF_SERVICE_CONGESTION_RISK\n429 Too Many Requests\nThe request is rejected due to excessive traffic which, if continued over time, may lead to (or may increase) an overload situation of the NF service instance. (NOTE 7)\nINSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES\n500 Internal Server Error\nThe request is rejected due to insufficient resources.\nUNSPECIFIED_NF_FAILURE\n500 Internal Server Error\nThe request is rejected due to unspecified reason at the NF. (NOTE 3)\nSYSTEM_FAILURE\n500 Internal Server Error\nThe request is rejected due to generic error condition in the NF.\nNF_FAILOVER\n500 Internal Server Error\nThe request is rejected due to the unavailability of the NF, and the requester may trigger an immediate re-selection of an alternative NF based on this information.\n(NOTE 6) (NOTE 8).\nNF_SERVICE_FAILOVER\n500 Internal Server Error\nThe request is rejected due to the unavailability of the NF service, and the requester may trigger an immediate re-selection of an alternative NF service based on this information.\n(NOTE 6) (NOTE 8).\nINBOUND_SERVER_ERROR\n502 Bad Gateway\nThe request is rejected due to the receipt of an 5xx error from an inbound server that the NF Service Producer accessed while attempting to fulfil the request (see clause 6.4.2.1).\nNF_CONGESTION\n503 Service Unavailable\nThe NF instance experiences congestion and performs overload control, which does not allow the request to be processed. (NOTE 4) (NOTE 7)\nNF_SERVICE_CONGESTION\n503 Service Unavailable\nThe NF service instance experiences congestion and performs overload control, which does not allow the request to be processed.

      "content": "All NF services expose APIs across the service based interfaces and the APIs operate on resources. Invocation of an API though a HTTP method may result in the change of state of a resource depending of the request type. When a HTTP/2 client sends a request and it does not receive a response or it experiences a delay, it does not guarantee that the HTTP/2 request has not been processed by the HTTP/2 server.\nA HTTP/2 client may retry the same request that uses an idempotent method any time (see IETF RFC 9110 [11] clause 9.2.2).\nRetrying a non-idempotent HTTP/2 request on the same resource before a response for the previous request is received may lead to state changes on the resource with unspecified behaviour. HTTP conditional requests, as specified in IETF RFC 9110 [11] may be used to avoid such situations.\nAn NF acting as an HTTP/2 client should also retry non-idempotent request if the request has not been processed, i.e. if the identifier of the stream corresponding to the request is larger than the Last-Stream-Id in a GOAWAY frame, or the REFUSED_STREAM error code is included in a RST_STREAM frame for the stream corresponding to the request as specified in clause 8.7 of IETF RFC 9113 [7]. API specific mechanisms as specified in respective technical specifications may be used for reconciling the state of resources, if the retry is attempted through a new TCP connection after a TCP connection failure.\nThe number of retry shall be limited. A client should always prefer to retry requests to an alternative server if the initial server is overloaded. In case of general overload situation where all possible servers are overloaded retry mechanisms should be disabled automatically.\nThe support of \"detection of duplicated request message\" is optional for HTTP clients and servers. When it is supported:\n-\tthe NF acting as an HTTP/2 client shall:\n-\tinclude an idempotency key (which shall uniquely identify the request message towards the target NF) in the 3gpp-Sbi-Request-Info header for a non-idempotent request message, e.g. a POST request;\n-\tinclude the same idempotency key in the 3gpp-Sbi-Request-Info header when subsequently the NF acting as an HTTP/2 client decides to retry the same request towards the same NF acting as an HTTP/2 server or an alternative NF (e.g. from the same NF (service) Set);\n-\tthe NF acting as an HTTP/2 server, upon receiving a request message containing an idempotency key in the 3gpp-Sbi-Request-Info header, may:\nuse the idempotency key to determine if it is a duplicated request message; and if so\n-\tproduce a proper response based on the current state of the resource/session context considering the original request has been processed.   The SCP shall forward the idempotency key received from the HTTP client unmodified towards the target NF, regardless of whether the SCP performs (re)selection of the target NF.\nThe idempotency key that is supplied as part of every non-idempotent request shall be unique and shall not be reused with another request other than a retransmission of the same request. The server may consider an idempotency key as expired after an operator configurable timer.",

      "content": "When an NF service consumer subscribes to an intermediate NF for events which may be detected and reported directly by target NF (e.g. an NEF subscribes to Location Reporting event at AMF via UDM and AMF directly reports to the NEF), the NF service consumer may include the \"3gpp-Sbi-Consumer-Info\" header in the subscription creation request to indicate the supported API versions, features and accepted encodings of the service on the target NF.\nWhen subscribing to the target NF and requiring the target NF to directly report to NF service consumer, the intermediate NF shall invoke the highest API version at the target NF which is supported by the NF service consumer (if indicated) and the intermediate NF. The intermediate NF shall include all received \"3gpp-Sbi-Consumer-Info\" header(s) in the subscription creation request sent to the target NF.\nIf the target NF received this header in event subscription creation, the target NF shall generate the request body according to the supported feature(s) and accepted encodings of the NF service consumer for notifications directly sent to the NF service consumer.\nBased on operator policy, the NF service consumer may provide a default inter-PLMN or intra-PLMN callback URI in a subscription request to the intermediate NF.\nThe NF Service Consumer may also include, for each provided service, the following information in the \"3gpp-Sbi-Consumer-Info\" header(s):\n-\tthe intraPlmnCallbackRoot parameter containing the callback root for receiving intra-PLMN notifications, and\n-\tthe interPlmnCallbackRoot parameter containing the callback root for receiving inter-PLMN notifications.\nUpon receiving a subscription request including the above information in the \"3gpp-Sbi-Consumer-Info\" header, the intermediate NF should check if the target NF is in VPLMN or HPLMN and adapt the callback Root of the callback URI according to the information received from the NF service consumer. For instance, if the NF service consumer included an inter-PLMN callback URI in the subscription request:\n-\tif the target NF is in HPLMN, then the intermediate NF should replace the callback Root of the callback URI in the subscription request with the provided intraPlmnCallbackRoot while sending the subscription creation request to the target NF; and\n-\tif the target NF is in VPLMN, then the intermediate NF shall not change the notification/callback URI.\nIn either case, the Intermediate NF should then forward the \"3gpp-Sbi-Consumer-Info\" header in the subscription creation request sent to the target NF.\nIf the intermediate NF expects to receive notifications from the target NF (e.g. the UDM may provide the callback URI to receive subscription change event notifications from the AMF when subscribing to AMF events on behalf of the NEF), to enable the target NF to use, e.g., the proper callback URI, the supported features, the intermediate NF may provide the \"3gpp-Sbi-Consumer-Info\" header for itself in the subscription creation request to the target NF. If it does so, the intermediate NF shall include the intermediate NF indication parameter in the header.\nWhen the target NF is an AMF, the source AMF should forward the information in the received \"3gpp-Sbi-Consumer-Info\" header(s) to the target AMF during inter-AMF mobility. If the target AMF received intraPlmnCallbackRoot and interPlmnCallbackRoot parameters in the \"3gpp-Sbi-Consumer-Info\" header information from the source AMF, the target AMF should determine the PLMN of the NF Service Consumer and adapt the callback root of the callback URI correspondingly.",

When supported, the following requirements shall apply.\nS-NSSAI/DNN level load control refers to advertising of the load information at S-NSSAI and DNN level granularity and selection of the target SMF service instance based on this information. It helps to achieve an evenly load balanced network at S-NSSAI/DNN granularity by the use of the dynamic load information provided within the Load Control Information with the S-NSSAI/DNN scope. Only an SMF may advertise S-NSSAI/DNN level load information.\nNOTE 1:\tWhen all the resources of an SMF (service) instance are available for all the S-NSSAI/DNNs served by that SMF (service) instance, load control at SMF (service) set or SMF (service) instance level is exactly the same as S-NSSAI/DNN level overload information of that SMF, for each of its S-NSSAIs/DNNs, and hence, performing load control at SMF (service) set or SMF (service) instance level is sufficient.\nThe \"Load Metric\" shall indicate the current resource utilization for the indicated S-NSSAI/DNN(s), as a percentage, as compared to the total resources configured for the indicated S-NSSAI/DNNs s at the SMF.\nWhen performing S-NSSAI/DNN based load control, the LCI scope shall indicate, in addition to either an NF-Instance, NF-Set, NF-Service-Instance or NF-Service-Set (see Table 6.3.3.4.2.2.1-1), the combinations of S-NSSAI and DNN  for which the LCI sender wants to advertise the load information using the following parameters:\n-\tthe S-NSSAI parameter, indicating one or more S-NSSAI values; and\n-\tthe DNN parameter, indicating one or more DNN values from the indicated S-NSSAI(s).\nNOTE 2:\tIt is not allowed to report LCI for a DNN only or for an S-NSSAI only.\nSee Table 6.3.3.4.4.2.2.1-1.\nTable 6.3.3.4.4.2.2.1-1: Additional scope parameters for S-NSSAI/DNN based load control by SMF\nParameter\nValue\nLCI scope (i.e. LCI applies to)\nExamples\nS-NSSAI\nOne or more S-NSSAI values\nDNN(s) from indicated S-NSSAI(s), for the service(s) of NF instance(s) as defined in Table 6.3.3.4.4.2.1-1.\nS-NSSAI: %7B%22sst%22%3A%201%2C%20%22sd%22%3A%20%22A08923%22%7D; DNN: internet.mnc012.mcc345.gprs\nDNN\nOne or more DNN values\nNOTE 1:\tBoth the S-NSSAI and DNN parameters shall be present.

An NF Service Producer may report OCI for different scopes, e.g.:\n-\tto report OCIs for an NF service instance, an NF service set and/or an NF instance;\n-\tto report OCIs at the level of an SMF (service) instance or SMF (service) set, and for specific S-NSSAI/DNNs;\n-\tto report OCIs for different S-NSSAI/DNNs of an SMF (service) instance or SMF (service) set.\nA NF Service Producer may also include OCI header(s) with different scopes in different messages, e.g. an SMF may report OCI for the entire SMF instance first, and then for a specific S-NSSAI/DNN only, if the overload conditions have changed and the SMF ends up with an overload only affecting a specific S-NSSAI/DNN.\nAn NF that receives OCI headers with different scopes, in the same message or in different messages, shall handle each OCI independently from each other. For instance, if an NF service consumer receives one OCI with the scope of an NF (Service) Set and then another OCI with the scope of an NF (Service) instance that pertains to the NF (Service) Set, the NF shall store the latter OCI and also consider that the former OCI is still valid for the NF (Service) Set until the related period of validity expires.\nIf an NF Service Consumer receives more than one OCI with overlapping scopes, e.g. one OCI with NF (service) instance scope and another OCI with NF (service) Set scope, the NF Service Consumer should perform overload control towards a target NF service instance considering the OCI received with the finer scope (i.e. in this example the overload of the NF (service) instance). For instance, if an AMF receives one OCI with an SMF instance scope and with an overload reduction metric of 20%, and one OCI with the scope of a specific SMF service set of the same SMF instance and with an overload reduction of 50%, the AMF should throttle 50% of the traffic targeting the specific SMF service set and 20% of the traffic targeting other SMF services instances of the SMF instance (if no valid OCI is available for the other SMF service instances).\nFor S-NSSAI/DNN based overload control (see clause 6.4.3.4.5.2.2), when signalling OCI for an SMF (service) instance or an SMF (service) set in a message, the SMF shall always include the full set of overload control information applicable to the SMF (service) instance or SMF (service) set, i.e. OCI for the SMF (service) instance or an SMF (service) set level and/or OCI for specific S-NSSAI/DNNs, even if only a subset of the OCI has changed; these OCIs shall contain the same Overload Control Timestamp. When including OCI for some S-NSSAI/DNN(s), the SMF should not provide any OCI for the SMF (service) instance or an SMF (service) set level unless OCI for such level is also applicable.\nIf an NF Service Consumer receives OCIs with overlapping scopes for an SMF (service) instance or an SMF (service) set level and for specific S-NSSAI/DNNs, the NF Service Consumer should perform overload control towards a target SMF service instance and S-NSSAI/DNN considering the OCI received with the finer scope. For instance, if an AMF receives an OCI for an SMF instance with an overload reduction metric of 20%, and one OCI for a specific S-NSSAI/DNN of the same SMF instance with an overload reduction of 50%, the AMF should throttle 50% of the traffic targeting the specific S-NSSAI/DNN and 20% of the traffic targeting other S-NSSAI/DNNs of the SMF instance (if no valid OCI is available for the other S-NSSAI/DNN).\nA NF Service Consumer may include one OCI header in a notification response sent with any HTTP status code (e.g. 2xx, 3xx, 4xx), or in a service request sent to a NF Service Producer.\nAn SCP/SEPP may additionally include one OCI in any service request or response, or notification request or response, sent towards a NF Service Consumer or NF Service Producer.\nThe OCI shall always include the Overload Timestamp, Overload Reduction Metric, OCI Period of Validity and Scope parameters (see clause 6.4.3.4.2 for the complete list of parameters).",

Larger variations should be considered as reasonable enough for advertising a new Overload Reduction Metric and thus justifying the processing requirement (to handle the new information) of the receiver. The exact granularity of the Overload Reduction Metric is an implementation matter.\nThe conveyance of the OCI signals that an overload situation is occurring, unless the Overload Reduction Metric is set to \"0\", which signals that the overload condition has ceased. Conversely, the absence of the OCI header in a message does not mean that the overload has abated.",

The timer corresponding to the Period of Validity shall be restarted each time an OCI with a new set of information is received for the same scope. When this timer expires, the last received OCI shall be considered outdated and obsolete (i.e. any associated overload condition shall be considered to have ceased) and the overload control enforcement shall be stopped.\nThe Period of Validity parameter achieves the following:\n-\tit avoids the need for the overloaded NF Service Producer/Consumer/SCP/SEPP to convey the OCI frequently to its peers when the overload state does not change. Therefore, this minimizes the processing required at the overloaded NF Service Producer/Consumer/SCP/SEPP and its peers upon sending/receiving HTTP/2 signalling;\n-\tit allows to reset the overload condition after some time the NF Service Consumer/Producer having received an overload indication from the overloaded peer, e.g. if no signalling traffic takes place between these HTTP peers for some time due to overload mitigation actions. This also removes the need for the overloaded NF Service Producer/Consumer/SCP/SEPP to remember the list of its peers to which it has sent a non-null overload reduction percentage and to which it would subsequently need to convey when the overload condition ceases.",

When supported, the following requirements shall apply.\nS-NSSAI/DNN level overload control refers to advertising of the overload information at S-NSSAI and DNN level granularity and hence applying the mitigation policies based on this information to the signalling traffic related to this S-NSSAI and DNN only. Only an SMF may advertise S-NSSAI/DNN level overload information when it detects overload for certain S-NSSAI/DNNs, e.g. based on shortage of internal or external resources for an S-NSSAI/DNN (e.g. IP address pool).\nNOTE 1:\tWhen all the internal and external resources, applicable to the S-NSSAI/DNNs, are available for all the S-NSSAI/DNNs served by an SMF, overload control at SMF (service) set or SMF (service) instance level is exactly the same as S-NSSAI/DNN level overload information of that SMF, for each of its S-NSSAIs/DNNs, and hence, performing overload control at SMF (service) set or SMF (service) instance level is sufficient.\nWhen performing S-NSSAI/DNN based overload control, the OCI scope shall indicate, in addition to either an NF-Instance, NF-Set, NF-Service-Instance or NF-Service-Set (see Table 6.4.3.4.5.2-1), the combinations of S-NSSAI and DNN for which the OCI sender wants to advertise the overload information using the following parameters: -\tthe S-NSSAI parameter, indicating one or more S-NSSAI values; and\n-\tthe DNN parameter, indicating one or more associated DNN values from the indicated S-NSSAI(s).\nNOTE 2:\tIt is not allowed to report OCI for a DNN only or for an S-NSSAI only.\nSee Table 6.4.3.4.5.2.2-1.\nTable 6.4.3.4.5.2.2-1: Additional scope parameters for S-NSSAI/DNN based overload control by SMF\nParameter\nValue\nOCI scope (i.e. OCI applies to)\nExamples\nS-NSSAI\nOne or more S-NSSAI values\nDNN(s) from indicated S-NSSAI(s), for the service(s) of NF instance(s) as defined in Table 6.4.3.4.5.2-1.\nS-NSSAI: %7B%22sst%22%3A%201%2C%20%22sd%22%3A%20%22A08923%22%7D; DNN: internet.mnc012.mcc345.gprs\nDNN\nOne or more DNN values\nNOTE 1:\tBoth the S-NSSAI and DNN parameters shall be present.

The message throttling shall be achieved either by rejecting the request messages, or by redirecting some of request messages to an alternative NF if possible, e.g. when a binding indication was received for the target resource/session context containing binding entities which have not been reported as overloaded.\nWhen sending (i.e. redirecting) the request towards an alternative NF to address an existing resource/session context, the sending NF may include a 3gpp-Sbi-Request-Info header in the request to indicate whether the request is redirected to an alternative NF as result of overload enforcement (see clause 5.2.3.3.12). The alternative NF may use this header to determine whether to accept the request, e.g. when accepting the request will not further overload the overloaded NF.\nMessage throttling shall apply to HTTP requests only (any service request including notification request).\nNetwork Functions shall support and use the \"Loss\" algorithm as specified in clause 6.4.3.5.2.",

Features that are supported by both are supported for the default notification subscription, which shall also apply to related default notifications.\nWhen an NF service consumer subscribes to notifications from an NF service producer via an intermediate NF (see Figure 7.1.2-3 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [5]), the NF service consumer may indicate, to the intermediate NF and the NF service producer, the API version(s) and the optional features it supports for the corresponding NF service producer's service by including the 3gpp-Sbi-Consumer-Info header in its request as described in clauses 5.2.3.3.7 and 6.2.2. When required by a given API, the NF service producer may then indicate the features supported by both the NF service consumer and NF service producer for the subscription and its notifications by including an attribute of the SupportedFeatures data type in the notification request it sends towards the NF service consumer.\nNOTE 1:\tThe above principles can also apply in scenarios where:a) the intermediate NF creates the subscription at the NF service producer by other means than a subscribe service operation (e.g. AF using the PCC framework to indicate its subscriptions to SMF events), by passing the 3gpp-Sbi-Consumer-Info header value within an attribute to the NF service producer (e.g. in a PCC rule); orb) the NF service consumer’s subscription is indicated to the NF service producer as a service parameter data stored in the UDR (acting as the intermediate NF) by passing the 3gpp-Sbi-Consumer-Info header value within an attribute to the UDR.Details are to be specified by each such API.\nAttributes used for the representation of a resource, particular values in enumerated data types, and/or procedural description can be marked to relate to a particular supported feature. Such attributes shall not be mandated in data structures. Such attributes or enumerated values shall only be sent and such procedures shall only be applied if the corresponding feature is supported.\nUnknown attributes and values shall be ignored by the receiving entity. Unsupported query parameters shall be handled as specified in clause 5.2.9.\nNOTE 2:\tThe sender can send such information before the supported features for a resource have been determined.\nFor an API that does not define any resources, only custom operations without associated resources or notifications without subscription will be used. For such APIs, if a feature negotiation is desired, the request and response bodies of a suitable custom operation or notification need to be defined in such a manner that an attribute of the SupportedFeatures data type defined in 3GPP TS 29.571 [13] is included. The client invoking that custom operation or notification shall indicate its supported features for that API within the corresponding HTTP request. The data structures to be included in the HTTP request as defined for that API, shall include the attribute of the SupportedFeatures data type defined in 3GPP TS 29.571 [13], preferably in the outermost data structure for cases where the body contains a complex structure with several layers of JSON objects. The server shall determine the supported features by comparing the supported features indicated by the client with its own supported features. Features that are supported both by the client and the server are supported for subsequent custom operations and notifications of that API. The server shall include the attribute of the SupportedFeatures data type defined in 3GPP TS 29.571 [13] indicating those features in the successful response to the custom operation or notification. The data structures to be included in the HTTP response as defined for that API, shall include the attribute of the SupportedFeatures data type defined in 3GPP TS 29.571 [13], preferably in the outermost data structure for cases where the body contains a complex structure with several layers of JSON objects. The client and server shall only use those supported features in subsequent communication of that API between each other until the supported feature negotiation performed as part of that communication yields a new result.\nAdditionally, a NF instance should register all the features it supports to the NRF, to enable NF Service Consumers to discover NF Service Producers supporting specific features. A NF instance should register all the features it supports as NF Service Consumer in the corresponding default notification subscription in its NF profile to the NRF, to enable NF Service Producer to select NF Service Consumer supporting specific features.\nSpecific requirements for support of Indirect Communication with Delegated Discovery are specified in clause 6.10.6.",

      "content": "Clause 13 in 3GPP TS 33.501 [17] specifies two alternative authorization mechanisms:\n-\tStatic authorization, which is based on local authorization policy at the NRF and the NF Service Producer (see clause 13.3.0);\n-\tToken based authorization, when NRF acts as the Authorization Server and provides access (see clause 13.3.1).\nAs specified in clause 13.4.1 of 3GPP TS 33.501 [17] OAuth 2.0 (see IETF RFC 6749 [22]) may be used for authorization of NF service access. All NFs and the NRF shall support the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework with \"Client Credentials\" grant type as specified in clause 4.4 of IETF RFC 6749 [22] , except that there is no \"Authorization\" HTTP request header in the access token request.\nThe NRF shall act as the Authorization Server providing \"Bearer\" access tokens (IETF RFC 6750 [23]) to the NF service consumers to access the services provided by the NF service providers.\nIf an NF service (i.e. API) receives an OAuth 2.0 access token in the \"Authorization\" HTTP request header field, the NF service shall validate the access token, its expiry and its access scope before allowing access to the requested resource, as specified in clause 7 of IETF RFC 6749 [22].\nThe access scope required to get access to a given resource may be, based on local configuration of the NF service producer, either:\n-\tthe service name of the NF Service; this scope grants generic access to a given API, for those operations on resources that don't require a specific authorization, or\n-\tboth, the service name of the NF Service, and a string that uniquely represents the type of operation (e.g. create/modify/read), the resource and the service; those two scopes, together, grant access to those operations on resources that require a specific authorization.\nAn NF service consumer shall support OAuth 2.0.\nFor request/response semantics service operations and for the subscribe and unsubscribe operations of subscribe/notify semantics service operations, an NF service consumer may use OAuth 2.0 for the authorization of the API access, based on local configuration. The NF service consumer discovers the additional scopes (resource/operation-level scopes) that might be required to invoke a certain service operation, based on the authorization information registered in NRF by the NF service producer in its NF profile.\nWhen Oauth2 authorization is used, the NF service consumer shall use the token received from NRF as a \"Bearer\" token and include it in the Authorization header of the HTTP service requests, as described in IETF RFC 6750 [23] clause 2.1.\nAn NF service producer shall decide to accept or reject an API request without the OAuth2.0 access token in the \"Authorization\" HTTP request header field, based on local configuration.\nIf an NF service producer rejects an API request without the OAuth2.0 access token or an API request with an invalid OAuth2.0 access token, it shall return the HTTP \"401 Unauthorized\" status code together with the \"WWW-Authenticate\" header as specified in IETF RFC 9110 [11], where:\n-\tthe scheme for challenge in the \"WWW-Authenticate\" header shall be set to \"Bearer\" (IETF RFC 6750 [23]),\n-\tthe \"realm\" attribute shall be set to the URI of the service (i.e. API URI) for which the access failed, in the case of request / response service operations,\n-\tthe \"error\" attribute shall be set to \"invalid_token\", as described in IETF RFC 6750 [23], if the request contained a token which was deemed as invalid by the NF service producer (e.g. it is expired, malformed...); if the request did not contain a token, the \"error\" attribute shall not be included.\nIf the request contains an invalid OAuth2.0 access token due to missing claims, the NF service producer may additionally include a ProblemDetails object in the 401 Unauthorized response with the cause attribute set to \"ACCESS_TOKEN_CLAIM_MISSING\" and with the invalidParams attribute indicating the missing claim name(s) necessary to access the protected resource (the invalidParams attribute may additionally indicate the \"WWW-Authenticate\" header as erroneous).\nIf an NF service producer rejects an API request with an OAuth2.0 access token not having the required scopes to invoke the service operation, it shall return the HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" status code together with the \"WWW-Authenticate\" header, where:\n-\tthe scheme for challenge in the \"WWW-Authenticate\" header shall be set to \"Bearer\",\n-\tthe \"realm\" attribute shall be set to the URI of the service (i.e API URI) for which the access failed, in the case of request / response service operations,\n-\tthe \"error\" attribute shall be set to \"insufficient_scope\" as described in IETF RFC 6750 [23],\n-\tthe \"scope\" attribute shall be set with the scope(s) necessary to access the protected resource.\nFor the notify operation of subscribe/notify semantics service operations, in this release of this specification OAuth 2.0 access token is not used.\nWhen an NF service consumer receives a \"401 Unauthorized\" or a \"403 Forbidden\" status code with a \"WWW-Authenticate\" header containing \"Bearer\" as the scheme for challenge it shall not repeat the same request without an OAuth2.0 access token or with an access token that has been already used. The NF service consumer may repeat the same request with a new OAuth 2.0 access token.\nNOTE:\tIf a NF service producer accepts a request without the OAuth 2.0 access token, based on local policy, it is assumed that such accesses are allowed based on trust relationships and hence full access to the resource as it would have been otherwise allowed, is provided.",

      "section_title": "Recommendations when defining SBI Message Priorities",
      "content": "The recommendations provided in this clause are compliant with clause 10 of IETF RFC 7944 [19]. The priority value range defined over SBIs spans from 0 to 31 (decimal), where 0 indicates the highest priority and 31 indicates the lowest priority. The recommendations have been adapted to 5G services and Service Based Architecture.\nThe priorities defined for all messages across all SBIs used in an HTTP/2 administrative domain must be defined in a consistent and coordinated fashion, taking the default priority (see below for default priority values) into account.\nThe following are some guidelines to be considered when defining the SMPs to be used in SBA networks that support HTTP/2 nodes handling multiple services.\n-\tAs with any prioritization scheme, it is possible for higher-priority messages to block lower-priority messages from ever being handled. In 5GC, this will often result in the messages being retried. This may result in more traffic than the network would have handled without use of the SMP mechanism.\nOne potential guideline to prevent unwanted starving of lower-priority messages is to have higher-priority messages represent a relatively small portion of messages handled by the 5GC under normal scenarios. The Multimedia Priority Service (see 3GPP TS 23.501 [5] clause 5.16.5) and the Mission Critical Service (see 3GPP TS 23.501 [5] clause 5.16.6) typically generate little traffic compared to the total traffic of a 5GC.\nThe Multimedia Priority Service (MPS) and the Mission Critical Service (MCX) require the blocking of lower-priority services.\n-\tA network entity (e.g., the AMF) that has received an RRC Establishment Cause associated with priority service (e.g., mps-PriorityAccess, mcs-PriorityAccess, or highPriorityAccess) or has determined that the UE has a priority subscription (e.g., MPS, MCX) in the UDM/UDR, shall select an SMP value appropriate for the priority service (e.g., MPS, MCX) for use in requests and responses.\nNOTE 1:\tOther situations (e.g., certain ARP, 5QI Priority Level or 5QI values) and/or other network elements (e.g., UDM, PCF, etc.) can also set the SMP to an appropriate level for a priority service.\n-\tWhen setting priorities for Multimedia Priority Services, Mission Critical Services or Emergency calls, it is important to use the same priority values across all APIs and services exposed by the 5GC. For instance, if the MPS priority levels of [1; n] are assigned the values of [k; k+n-1], then the same values shall be defined in the same order on all SBIs for the same service.\n-\tMessages related to MPS, MCX and Emergency calls may be ranked according to their priority (e.g., based on ARP priority level, 5QI priority level, MPS Priority) based on regional/national regulatory and operator policies when it is known by the application sending the message. Otherwise MPS and MCX should have higher priorities than Emergency calls. Emergency call related messages should have higher priority than the rest of the messages. The ranking can be used to select SMP values.\nNOTE 2:\tIn some situations (e.g. REGISTRATION or SERVICE REQUEST procedure); it is possible to identify that the message belongs to a procedure of a high priority user without knowing the identity of the priority service. In such a case, all the messages sent over an SBI of these high priority procedures should be given the same SBI message priority.\nThe following are general requirements:\n-\tRequests without the \"3gpp-Sbi-Message-Priority\" header shall be assigned the default priority value of \"24\".\n-\tWhen defining priorities of the messages of a service, the same rules apply independently of the application, the SBI and the service:\n-\tWhen there is a series of request/response required to complete a procedure, it is appropriate to mark request/responses that occur later in the series at a higher priority than those that occur early in the series.\n-\tThe requests that establish new sessions should have a lower priority than the requests that update or end a session.\n-\tThe requests that will result in deregistering users if they failed (e.g., due to authentication vector retrieval, or update location) shall have a higher priority than the requests of a non-registered user.\n-\tRequest/responses of optional procedures and of delay tolerant services should have lower priority than those of mandatory procedures.",

The latter shall convey these NF service discovery factors using the\"3gpp-Sbi-Discovery-*\" request headers. How to set the values of these \"3gpp-Sbi-Discovery-*\" request headers is detailed in clause 5.2.3.2.7. The NF service consumer should also include at least the target NF type and service name in the corresponding \"3gpp-Sbi-Discovery-*\" request header(s) in its request to the SCP. The NF service consumer may indicate the NRF to use, e.g. as a result of an NSSF query, by including the 3gpp-Sbi-Nrf-Uri header with the NRF API URIs.\nIf the NF service consumer delegates the reselection of a target NF service instance to the SCP (see clause 6.5 of 3GPP TS 23.527 [38]), the NF service consumer shall also include \"3gpp-Sbi-Discovery-*\" headers in an HTTP/2 request targeting an existing resource context in the NF service producer, if the \"3gpp-Sbi-Routing-Binding\" header is not included in the HTTP/2 request message (e.g. when no binding information was received from the NF service producer during the resource creation, or if the NF service consumer does not support the binding procedures), to enable the SCP to reselect an NF service producer instance, e.g. if the NF service producer instance indicated in the \"3gpp-Sbi-Target-apiRoot\" header or target URI is not reachable. Additionally, regardless of whether a 3gpp-Sbi-Routing-Binding\" header is included or not in the HTTP/2 request message, the NF service consumer should include at least the target NF type and the service name in the corresponding \"3gpp-Sbi-Discovery-*\" request header(s) in its request to the SCP.\nNOTE 1:\tOther 3gpp-Sbi-Discovery-*\" request header(s) can also be included in any service request sent to an SCP, regardless of whether the 3gpp-Sbi-Routing-Binding\" header is included or not in the HTTP/2 request message, to convey requester's information necessary for the NRF to validate whether the requester is allowed to discover and access a given NF (see NOTE 12 of Table 6.2.3.2.3.1-1 of 3GPP TS 29.510 [8]).\nNOTE 2:\tA request including a 3gpp-Sbi-Routing-Binding header needs not include the requested S-NSSAI in the corresponding 3gpp-Sbi-Discovery-*\" request header, since if the NF service producer supports different sets of NF service instances serving different network slices, the NF Service Set ID in the binding indicaton is available for reselecting an NF service instance (see clauses 5.2.3.2.5 and 6.12.1).\nIf the NF service consumer includes more than one service name in the 3gpp-Sbi-Discovery-service-names header, the service name corresponding to the service request shall be listed as the first service name in the header.\nNOTE 3:\tThe SCP can assume that the service request corresponds to the first service name in the header.\nAn NF service consumer should also include \"3gpp-Sbi-Discovery-*\" headers in an HTTP/2 request targeting an existing resource context in the NF service producer to enable the SCP to perform the Service access authorization procedures (see clause 13.4.1.3.2 of 3GPP TS 33.501 [17]).\nLikewise, an NF service producer may also include 3gpp-Sbi-Discovery-*\" headers in a notification or callback request, if the \"3gpp-Sbi-Routing-Binding\" header is not included in the HTTP/2 request message, to enable the SCP to reselect a different NF service consumer instance, e.g. if the NF service consumer instance indicated in the \"3gpp-Sbi-Target-apiRoot\" header or target URI is not reachable. Additionally, regardless of whether a 3gpp-Sbi-Routing-Binding header is included or not in the HTTP/2 request message, the NF service producer should include at least the target NF type (i.e. the type of the NF service consumer) in the corresponding \"3gpp-Sbi-Discovery-*\" request header(s) in its request to the SCP, if available. See clause 6.6 of 3GPP TS 23.527 [38].\nWhen the 3gpp-Sbi-Selection-Info header is included in a HTTP request message and if the SCP supports this header, the SCP shall use it together with 3gpp-Sbi-Routing-Binding or 3gpp-Sbi-Discovery-* heads whichever available.\nBased on SCP configuration, an SCP deciding to address a next-hop SCP for a service request may delegate the NF instance and/or service instance discovery and selection to subsequent SCPs, in which case it shall forward the \"3gpp-Sbi-Discovery-*\" request headers to the next-hop SCP.\nWhen receiving a request containing \"3gpp-Sbi-Discovery-*\" request headers and a selection/reselection of the target NF service instance is required, the SCP shall take into account all the NF service discovery factors contained in the \"3gpp-Sbi-Discovery-*\" request headers to perform the selection or reselection. The SCP should use the NRF indicated in the 3gpp-Sbi-Nrf-Uri header if this header is present in the request. It is also possible for the SCP to be internally configured to fulfil these service discovery tasks without interacting with the NRF.\nIf the service request contains \"3gpp-Sbi-Discovery-*\" request header(s) that are not supported by the SCP, the latter should include the corresponding query parameters in the discovery request to the NRF. Based on operator policy, the SCP may alternatively reject the request and return a response with the status code \"400 Bad Request\" to the NF service consumer with an \"INVALID_DISCOVERY_PARAM\" error.\nIf the service request does not contain the 3gpp-Sbi-Discovery-preferred-api-versions header, the SCP shall select an NF instance and/or service instance that supports the MAJOR version received in the request URI of the service request message. Otherwise, the preferred API MAJOR version included in the 3gpp-Sbi-Discovery-preferred-api-versions header shall be the same as the MAJOR version of the request URI of the service request message. The SCP shall reject the request and return a response with the status code \"400 Bad Request\" to the NF service consumer with an \"INVALID_API\" error if no NF profile is found matching the MAJOR version; in this case, the SCP may indicate in the problem details the MAJOR API version(s) known to be supported by NF service producers for the corresponding service.",

Likewise, other \"3gpp-Sbi-Discovery-*\" request header(s), e.g. target-plmn-list, requester-plmn-list, can also be included for the same purpose.\nThe NF service consumer may indicate the NRF to use, e.g. as a result of an NSSF query, by including the 3gpp-Sbi-Nrf-Uri header with the NRF API URIs.\nIf the NF service consumer includes more than one service name in the 3gpp-Sbi-Discovery-service-names header, the service name corresponding to the service request shall be listed as the first service name in the header.\nNOTE 2:\tThe SCP can assume that the service request corresponds to the first service name in the header.\nSCPs shall support Indirect Communication without Delegated Discovery, which requires support for the following:\n-\tdiscovering and selecting a target NF service instance from the target NF (service) set identified in the 3gpp-Sbi-Discovery-target-nf-set-id, 3gpp-Sbi-Discovery-target-nf-service-set-id, 3gpp-Sbi-Discovery-amf-region-id and/or 3gpp-Sbi-Discovery-amf-set-id; and\n-\tat least the following additional discovery headers:  3gpp-Sbi-Discovery-target-nf-type, 3gpp-Sbi-Discovery-service-names, 3gpp-Sbi-Discovery-snssais, 3gpp-Sbi-Discovery-target-plmn-list, 3gpp-Sbi-Discovery-requester-plmn-list.\nNOTE 3:\tThe SCP can derive the requester NF type from the User-Agent header.\nSCPs shall additionally support reselecting an alternative target NF service instance when a (Routing) Binding Indication is not available, as specified in clauses 6.5.3 and 6.6.3 of 3GPP TS 23.527 [38] and shall also support the 3gpp-Sbi-Discovery-target-nf-instance-id.\nNOTE 4:\tThe inclusion of the 3gpp-Sbi-Discovery-target-nf-instance-id in an HTTP request enables the SCP to discover the profile of the target NF instance and to possibly reselect a different target NF service instance from the same NF instance or from a different NF instance in the same set, e.g. when the target NF instance is not reachable, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.527 [38].\nIf the request does not include the apiRoot of a selected NF service instance, or if the SCP needs to reselect a different NF service instance, the SCP shall select an NF service instance using the NF (Service) Set ID and any additional information (e.g. S-NSSAI, service name, target NF type) received in the corresponding \"3gpp-Sbi-Discovery-*\" request header(s), if available. If the SCP is to invoke NF service discovery towards the NRF to fulfil this task, the SCP should use the NRF indicated in the 3gpp-Sbi-Nrf-Uri header, if this header is present in the request.

An access token received in a previous service response is valid for the new service request if:\n-\tit has a matching scope, or it has a matching service-level scope only (i.e. the new service request also requires a resource/operation-level scope that is not present in the scope of the access token received in the previous service response);\n-\tit has a matching audience (i.e. matching producer's NF type or NF instance ID);\n-\tit has a matching producer's NF set ID, S-NSSAI, NSI and PLMN ID, if the access token contains a producer NF set ID, S-NSSAI, NSI and PLMN ID respectively; and\n-\tthe access token has not expired.\nNOTE 1:\tIf the NF service consumer has multiple cached access tokens that are valid for a service request, it is left for implementation how to select the access token to include in the request.

If the NF service consumer has included an access token in the service request and the 3gpp-Sbi-Access-Scope header, the 3gpp-Sbi-Access-Scope header contains multiple scopes, and the access token has a matching scope only for a subset of the scopes present in the 3gpp-Sbi-Access-Scope header, the SCP should consider that the access token has a valid scope for the service request if the NF service producer does not require any scope not granted in the Access Token (as determined from its NF profile); otherwise, the SCP shall request a new access token for the service request.\nNOTE 4:\tThis allows the SCP to consider that an access token has a valid scope if the 3gpp-Sbi-Access-Scope header contains a service-level scope and a resource/operation-level scope, the access token has a scope matching only the service-level scope, and the NF service producer is not configured to require the resource/operation-specific scope.\nWhen the NRF receives a request to obtain an access token for a list of scopes, but the NF service producer's profile does not allow to grant a token for all the requested scopes, the NRF should grant an access token but restricted to the allowed scope, unless the request cannot be authorized for other reasons.\nNOTE 5:\tThis allows the NRF to grant an access token for a service-level scope, in response to an access token request for a list of scopes including a service-level scope and a resource/operation-level scope, when the NF service producer's profile is not configured to require the resource/operation-level scope.\nA failure to obtain an access scope received in the 3gpp-Sbi-Other-Access-Scopes header in the granted token shall not result in the SCP failing the service request, as long as all the scopes required for access authorization for the incoming service request have been authorized by the NRF.\nWhen the SCP requests an access token for a service request, the SCP may include the access token it has obtained from the NRF in the service response it forwards to the NF service consumer, by including the 3gpp-Sbi-Access-Token header, for possible re-use in subsequent service requests by the NF service consumer.

See clause 6.3.1.0 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [3] and clause 4.17.12 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [4].\nA binding may be established or updated as part of a:\n1)\tservice response creating or modifying a resource, to be used for subsequent requests targeting this resource (see clause 4.17.12.2 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [4]), for any API that defines resources;\n2)\tservice request, if the NF Service Consumer can also act as an NF Service Producer for later communication from the contacted NF Service Producer, to be used for subsequent service requests initiated by the contacted NF Service Producer (see clause 4.17.12.3 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [4]);\n3)\tservice request creating or modifying an explicit or an implicit subscription, or as part of a notification response, to be used for subsequent notification requests initiated by the NF Service Producer (see clause 4.17.12.3 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [4]);\n4)\tservice response creating an implicit or explicit subscription or updating a subscription, or as part of a notification request, to be used for subsequent operations on the subscription (see clause 4.17.12.4 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [4]);\n5)\tservice request creating a callback (other than notification) resource (e.g. V-SMF or I-SMF callback URI sent to the H-SMF or SMF), or as part of a callback response, to be used for subsequent callback requests initiated by the NF Service Producer (e.g. H-SMF or SMF initiated PDU session modification);\n6)\tcallback request sent from a NF Service Producer to update the binding for the resource context, to be used by the NF Service Consumer for subsequent service requests addressing the resource context.\nTwo types of binding information are defined to manage the binding between an NF Service Consumer and an NF Service Resource:\n1)\tA Binding Indication conveys binding information for a resource which must be stored by the consumer (client) of that resource and used by the client to direct future requests to the resource.  When contained in a service request, the binding information is associated with a resource owned by the NF Service Consumer for the current transaction.  When contained in a service response, the binding information is associated with a resource owned by the NF Service Producer for the current transaction.\n2)\tA Routing Binding Indication conveys binding information to direct a request from a client to a server which has the context. A Routing Binding Indication shall only be contained in an HTTP request.\nA same service request may convey more than one Binding Indication, e.g.:\n-\tto provide bindings for notification or callback (i.e. bullets 3 or 5) and for other services that the NF service consumer can provide later as a NF Service Producer (i.e. bullet 2); or\n-\tto provide binding information for different event notifications, when creating a subscription on behalf of another NF (see clause 6.12.4).\nThe scope parameter in a Binding Indication in a service request (or notification or callback response) identifies the applicability of (i.e. scenario associated with) the binding information.\nA service request may convey one or more Binding Indications as described above using a 3gpp-Sbi-Binding header and/or include a Binding Routing Indication to influence routing of the request e.g. to an appropriate set of NF Service Producers or to an appropriate service set of the NF Service Producer using a 3gpp-Sbi-Routing-Binding header.  A service response may convey a Binding Indication for a resource using a 3gpp-Sbi-Binding header.\nNOTE 1:\tAn HTTP request can contain for instance one 3gpp-Sbi-Binding header containing two Binding Indications for other services and for callbacks, and one 3gpp-Sbi-Routing-Binding header conveying a Routing Binding Indication.\nOnce a binding indication has been received for a particular resource or scope, the absence of a binding indication for the same resource or scope in a subsequent request/response message shall be interpreted as meaning that the earlier received binding indication for that resource or scope has not changed, unless specified otherwise in the rest of the specification (see scenarios with NF service producer or consumer change further down, and clause 6.12.4 for inter-AMF mobility scenarios).\nIn scenarios with NF service producer change (e.g. V-SMF or I-SMF change), the NF service consumer (e.g. AMF) shall delete any earlier binding indication received from the old NF service producer (e.g. old V-SMF/I-SMF) for the producer's resource (e.g. SM context resource) and replace it by any new binding indication possibly received from the new NF service producer (e.g. new V-SMF/I-SMF).\nIn scenarios with NF service consumer change (e.g. inter-AMF mobility), the NF service producer (e.g. SMF) shall delete any earlier binding indication received from the old NF service consumer (e.g. binding indication for callback request received from the old AMF) and replace it by any new binding indication possibly received from the new NF service consumer (e.g. new AMF).\nIf an SCP receives a Routing Binding Indication within a service or notification request and decides to forward that request to a next-hop SCP, it shall include the Routing Binding Indication in the forwarded request. The SCP shall remove the Routing Binding Indication if it forwards the request to the target NF.\nBinding Indications and Routing Binding Indications shall include the Binding level and one or more Binding entity IDs representing all NF service instances that are capable to serve service requests targeting the resource, i.e. that share the same resource contexts.\nThe Binding Level indicates a preferred binding to either a NF Instance, a NF set, a NF Service Instance or a NF Service Set.\nWhen sending a request targeting the resource context in a NF Service Producer or the session context in a NF Service Consumer, the resource URI received in the Location header or the Notification/Callback URI shall be used first if available to set the \"3gpp-Sbi-Target-apiRoot\" header or target URI; as an exception, if the binding indication earlier received for the target resource context or session context indicates a binding level of \"NF service set\", \"NF Instance\" or \"NF Set\" and alternative NF service instances within the preferred binding entity corresponding to the binding level are available, the request may alternatively be sent to one of these alternative NF service instances. When the URI received in the Location header or the Notification/Callback URI is not reachable or when becoming aware of a NF Service Producer or Consumer change as specified in bullet 3 of clauses 6.5.3.2 and 6.5.3.3, the binding entity corresponding to the binding level shall be selected whenever possible. If this is not possible, e.g. because the preferred binding entity is not reachable, the request should be sent to any other Binding entity signalled in the Binding Indication or Routing Binding Indication, in the following decreasing order of priority:\n-\tselect an NF service instance if available in the backup NF instance, if a backup NF service instance and/or backup NF instance was signalled in the Binding Indication or Routing Binding Indication;\n-\tselect an NF service instance in the same NF service set, if a NF service Set ID was signalled in the Binding Indication or Routing Binding Indication;\n-\tselect an equivalent NF service instance in the same NF instance, if an NF instance ID was signalled in the Binding Indication or Routing Binding Indication;\n-\tselect an NF service instance in an equivalent NF service set of the backup AMF instance, if a NF service Set ID and backup AMF Instance ID was signalled in the Binding Indication or Routing Binding Indication;\n-\tselect an equivalent NF service instance in the backup AMF instance, if backup AMF Instance ID was signalled in the Binding Indication or Routing Binding Indication;\n-\tselect an NF service instance in an equivalent NF service set of another NF instance of the NF set, if an NF Service Set ID and an NF Set ID were signalled in the Binding Indication or Routing Binding Indication;\n-\tselect an equivalent NF service instance in another NF instance of the NF Set, if an NF Set ID was signalled in the Binding Indication or Routing Binding Indication.\nNOTE 2:\tNF service instances from different NF instances are equivalent NF service instances if they share the same MCC, MNC, NID (for SNPN), ServiceName, API version, and, if applicable, NF Service Set ID (see clause 28.13 of 3GPP TS 23.003 [15]).\nBinding Indications shall not be used if a particular resource can only be served by a specific NF service instance of an NF instance, i.e. if NF service instances of a same NF service are not capable to share resource inside the NF Instance, unless the receiver of the Binding Indication has indicated its support of the no-redundancy indication in the Binding Indication in the SupportFeatures attribute for a specific API (see clause 5.2.3.2.6). A resource for which no Binding Indication or Routing Binding Indication is signalled shall be considered to be bound exclusively to one NF service instance, unless the NF Service resource owner instance is part of an NF set (or AMF set) or an NF service set, or unless its NF profile in the NRF indicates that its supports NF service persistence within the NF instance (see clause 6.5 of 3GPP TS 23.527 [38]).\nAn NF service producer supporting different sets of NF service instances, e.g. serving different network slices, shall include the NF Service Set ID in the Binding Indication to enable the reselection (when required) of an alternative NF service instance from the same or an equivalent NF service set. See also clause 6.10.3.2 for requirements on the inclusion of \"3gpp-Sbi-Discovery-*\" headers in service requests targeting an existing resource context in the NF service producer.\nA Binding Indication may be shared by multiple resource/session contexts, i.e. these resource contexts (in the NF Service Producer) or session contexts (in the NF Service Consumer) are sharing the same resilience information. The Binding Indication for multiple contexts has the same semantics as the one for a single resource/session context but with the following additions. When it is supported as indicated in the Supported Features for a specific service API:\n-\tboth NF Service Consumer and NF Service Producer can indicate if the Binding Indication for multiple contexts; and if the Binding Indication is for multiple contexts, the \"group\" parameter in the Binding Indication shall be set to \"true\";\n-\ta group id may be included in the Binding Indication to indicate the group to which resource/session contexts pertain are sharing the same Binding Indication, when the resource/session context is created;\n-\tthe Binding Indication for a group of contexts may be updated towards each Resource URI with different apiRoot part (representing different peer NF (service) instances) or towards each Notification URI with different authority part, or with the same authority part but different callback-uri-prefix (see clause 5.2.3.3.7) if it is provided in 3gpp-Sbi-Consumer-Info header when the NF service consumer provides the Callback URI, e.g. when the NF is changed, by including an oldgroupid, oldnfinst, oldservset, oldservinst or uribase to address applicable contexts for the update of the Binding Indication. When the oldgroupid is present, the groupid shall also be present to indicate the new group id which is newly allocated. Additionally, the Binding Indication may be updated for a group of UE contexts by including the gumai to address applicable UE contexts for the update of the Binding Indication.",

For instance, if the Binding Indication contains an NF Set ID, an NF Instance ID and a binding level is set to NF Instance, the notification can be sent to any NF instance of the NF set if the NF instance identified by the NF Instance ID is not reachable. See clause 6.3.1.0 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [3].\nThe NF Service Producer shall store the Binding Indication received from the NF Service Consumer and include it in a 3gpp-Sbi-Routing-Binding header in subsequent notification requests it sends to the NF Service Consumer (that acts as an HTTP server) related to this subscription. See also clause 6.10.3.2 for requirements on the inclusion of \"3gpp-Sbi-Discovery-*\" headers in notification requests. For a default notification subscription, the NF Service Producer shall fetch the Binding Indication value (if available) from the NF profile of the NF Service Consumer and include it in a 3gpp-Sbi-Routing-Binding header in related notification requests. For notifications corresponding to default notification subscriptions using Indirect Communication with Delegated Discovery (see clause 6.10.3.3), when the notification is targeting a specific NF instance/NF service instance, the SCP shall fetch the Binding Indication value (if available) for the default notification subscription from the NF profile of the NF Service Consumer. The NF Service Producer or the SCP shall use this information for selecting or reselecting an NF Service Consumer (HTTP server) which has access to the original consumer's NF Service Resource context, for direct or indirect communication respectively, as specified in clause 6.3.1.0 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [3]. If the notification endpoint provided in the subscription is not reachable, the NF Service Producer or SCP shall look up for an alternative notification endpoint address at the service level (i.e. NF Service registered in NRF) if the Binding Indication contains a service name or a binding to an NF Service Instance or NF Service Set, or at the NF instance level (i.e. NF Profile registered in NRF) otherwise. The NF Service Producer or SCP shall derive the alternative notification URI (or callback URI) as described in clauses 6.5.2.2 and 6.5.3.2 and shall use that URI in subsequent notifications.\nThe NF Service Consumer may provide an updated Binding Indication to the NF Service Producer in a service request modifying the subscription or in a notification response.\nThe NF Service Producer may also provide a Binding Indication in a service response creating or modifying an explicit or an implicit subscription, or in a notification request generated for this subscription, by including a 3gpp-Sbi-Binding header (see clause 5.2.3.2.5) in the HTTP response, or in the HTTP request respectively (without the scope parameter), as specified in clause 6.12.2. If the service request creates a resource and a subscription, the Binding Indication returned in the HTTP response shall apply to both the NF Service Resource and the subscription, i.e. the created resource and subscription shall be bound to the same (service) set of producers or producer instance. The NF Service Consumer shall store the Binding Indication received from the NF Service Producer and include it in a 3gpp-Sbi-Routing-Binding header in subsequent related service requests as specified in clause 6.12.2.\nFor a default notification subscription, a NF Service Consumer shall update the Binding Indication value in NF profile when binding information of the default notification subscription has changed.\nA subscription request may also contain a Routing Binding Indication that can be used in case of indirect communication by the SCP to route the message to the NF Service Producer.\nA service request may create an explicit subscription on behalf of another NF (e.g. UDM subscribing to an AMF event on behalf of the NEF); typically, this may happen when a \"source\" NF (e.g. NEF) issues a service request to an \"intermediate\" NF (e.g. UDM) who sends a subsequence service request to a \"target\" NF (e.g. AMF). The \"intermediate\" NF may include two Binding Indications: a first Binding Indication for subscription change event notification sent from the \"target\" NF to the \"intermediate\" NF (e.g. notifications to UDM upon AMF change) and a second Binding Indication for the event notifications sent from the \"target\" NF to the \"source\" NF (e.g. AMF notification to the NEF).\nIn the former Binding Indication, the scope parameter shall be set to \"subscription-events\"; in the latter Binding Indication (corresponding to the event notifications to the \"target\" NF to the \"source\" NF), the scope parameter shall be set to \"callback\" or be absent, and the other binding parameters (\"bl\", \"nfset\", etc.) shall be taken from the original service request from the \"source\" to the \"intermediate\" NF (e.g. binding parameters in the service request from NEF to UDM).\nThe \"source\" NF (e.g. NEF) or \"intermediate\" NF (e.g. UDM) may also include an \"nr\" (notification receiver) parameter in its Binding Indication conveying the notification URI used by the \"target\" NF (e.g. AMF) in subsequent event notifications. This \"nr\" parameter allows the \"target\" NF to match binding information with different types of notification events in scenarios in which the \"intermediate\" NF combines multiple subscriptions to the \"target\" NF, in a single subscription request.\nUpon receipt of a subscription change event notification, the \"intermediate\" NF may include in the notification response an (updated) Binding Indication for subscription change event notification with the scope parameter set to \"subscription-events\".\nUpon receipt of an event notification from the \"target\" NF, the \"source\" NF may include in the notification response an (updated) Binding Indication for event notifications sent from the \"target\" NF to the \"source\" NF with the scope parameter set to \"callback\" or absent.\nNOTE 3:\tBinding indications for subscription change event notification and for event notifications sent from the \"target\" NF to the \"source\" NF are transferred by the source AMF to the target AMF during inter-AMF mobility procedures, if the source AMF supports the binding procedures. Accordingly, the \"intermediate\" NF only needs to include a Binding Indication for subscription change event notification in the notification response if the Binding Indication is updated.\nNOTE 4:\tUpon receipt of a subscription change event notification, the \"intermediate NF\" needs not include a Binding Indication for event notifications sent from the \"target\" NF to the \"source\" NF. Doing so could conflict with binding updates sent by the \"source\" NF to the \"target\" NF, if the \"intermediate\" NF has not been updated (yet) by the \"source\" NF with the binding updates.\nDuring an inter-AMF UE mobility, if the target AMF notifies an NF service consumer of an AMF event subscription that the subscription Id has changed (see clause 5.3.2.4.1 of 3GPP TS 29.518 [31]), the NF service consumer shall delete any earlier binding indication received from the source AMF for the AMF event subscription resource and replace it by any new binding indication possibly received from the target NF in the notification request.",

The HTTP server should include the 3gpp-Sbi-NF-Peer-Info header in a response even when the header is not included in the request received from the HTTP client.\nIf the destination peer information provided by HTTP client in the request does not match the information of the HTTP server (e.g. due to the HTTP server having updated its NF (Service) instance ID), the HTTP server should include the updated NF (Service) instance ID values in the response header sent to HTTP client.\nWhen forwarding a request or response that includes the 3gpp-Sbi-NF-Peer-Info header, the SCP should forward this header and may update the destination peer info if the receiver NF is (re)selected; the SCP shall also update the srcscp/dstscp components, based on the source and destination SCP of the forwarded HTTP request or response, as described in clause 5.2.3.2.21; the SEPP shall also update the dstscp component (if SEPP relays the request towards an SCP).\nIn an inter-PLMN scenario, the SEPP may remove the header based on operator policies. If an SCP or SEPP generates an error response to a request including this header, the SCP and SEPP should insert the header in the response with source peer info containing the information of the SCP or SEPP, and with destination peer info containing the source peer info in the request respectively.",

      "content": "When the SEPP receives request from NF consumer or SCP of the same network bound to another network (in case of cSEPP), or from the peer SEPP (in case of pSEPP), the SEPP shall evaluate the intended purpose of the signaling from the following information:\n-\tSource PLMN;\n-\tTarget PLMN; and\n-\tintended purpose in the received in the 3gpp-Sbi-Interplmn-Purpose header, if available\nIf the SEPP (i.e. cSEPP) receives request from NF consumer or SCP of the same network bound to another network including 3gpp-Sbi-Interplmn-Purpose header, the receiving SEPP shall compare the value received in the header with the preconfigured value of allowed intended purpose between the source and target PLMN.\nIf the SEPP (i.e. pSEPP) receives from the peer SEPP including 3gpp-Sbi-Interplmn-Purpose header, the receiving SEPP shall compare the value received in the header with the pre-negotiated value of allowed intended purpose between the source and target PLMN during Security Capability Negotiation procedure specified in 3GPP TS 29.573 [27].\nThe receiving SEPP shall:\n-\tIf the purpose in the 3gpp-Sbi-Interplmn-Purpose header matches with any one of the preconfigured purposes (for cSEPP) or pre-negotiated purposes (for pSEPP) as allowed by the receiving SEPP, then the receiving SEPP shall continue processing the request.\n-\tElse, the receiving SEPP shall reject the message with 403 Forbidden with ProblemDetails REQUESTED_PURPOSE_NOT_ALLOWED as defined in Table 5.2.7.4-1.\nEXAMPLE\tThe following example describes how cSEPP and pSEPP evaluates and process with regards to the intended purposes.\na)\tcSEPP and pSEPP are configured with the allowed purpose =X, Y\n-\tCase 1:NFc/SCP sends the first message to cSEPP with purpose = X. In this case, cSEPP validates the message against the configured purpose and allows it. Using the N32 connection established between cSEPP and pSEPP for purpose = X , cSEPP delivers the message to pSEPP. Then only pSEPP checks the purpose=X over N32f with the pre-negotiated purpose.\n-\tCase 2:NFc/SCP sends a second message to cSEPP with the purpose=Z. Here, cSEPP rejects it on its own because it is not allowed purpose for cSEPP (configured).\nb)\tcSEPP is configured with allowed purpose X, Y and pSEPP is configured with X, K. The negotiated/allowed purpose between cSEPP and pSEPP is X.\n-\tCase 3:NFc/SCP sends a message to cSEPP with purpose =Y. In this case, cSEPP autonomously rejects the message based on the negotiated purposes (i.e. purpose X) with pSEPP.\nIf the SEPP receives request from NF consumer or SCP of the same network bound to another network (in case of cSEPP), or from the peer SEPP (in case of pSEPP) that does not include the 3gpp-Sbi-Interplmn-Purpose header, the receiving SEPP shall by default consider this as roaming and inter-PLMN mobility in order to allow backward compatibility for NF consumers which do not support the 3gpp-Sbi-Interplmn-Purpose header, and apply the policy accordingly. The purpose of transactions of AMFs or SMFs between two different VPLMNs, i.e. inter AMF or inter V-SMF signalling from VPLMN1 to VPLMN2 shall be considered as inter PLMN mobility.\nAnnex A (informative):Client-side Adaptive Throttling for Overload Control\nThis clause contains an example algorithm to make an NF Service Consumer adjust the traffic rate sent to an NF Service Producer based on the number of received \"rejects\" of HTTP requests with a status code \"503 Service Unavailable\", or requests that have timed-out and the response was never received. This algorithm is described in the book \"Betsy Beyer, et al; Google: Site Reliability Engineering\" (https://landing.google.com/sre/book.html), clause 21, \"Handling Overload\".\nNOTE:\tThe reference link provided to the book can change and hence the name of the book is expected to be used for referring to the latest edition.\nEach client (NF Service Consumer) keeps track of the following counters during a certain time window:\n-\tRequests: The number of requests that the client (NF Service Consumer) needs to handle. Under normal operation (no overload), all these requests are sent to the server (NF Service Producer). Under an overload situation, part of these requests are locally rejected by the client (and not sent to the server), and the rest of the requests are sent to the server.\n-\tAccepts: The number of requests accepted by the server (i.e., requests for which a response has been effectively received at the client, with a status code other than \"503 Service Unavailable\").\nWhen there is no server overload, these values are equal.\nWhen there is an overload status in the server, the rate between \"Accepts\" and \"Requests\" decreases progressively. When this rate falls below a certain point (given by an algorithm parameter named \"K\"), the client shall start dropping some requests locally and not send them to the server.\nThe local rejection of requests can be done by calculating a \"Client request rejection probability\", as:\nSo, for example, assuming that the K parameter is set at 1.5:\n-\tif the server accepts >67% of the traffic, and rejects <33% of the traffic, the client does not take any throttling action, and keeps sending to the server all the traffic it has available for processing\n-\tif, during a first time-window, the server accepts, e.g., only 60% of the requests, and rejects 40% due to overload, the application of this algorithm implies that the client must drop locally 10% of the requests (probabilistically), and only send to the server the remainder 90% of its traffic.\n-\tif, during a second time-window, the client keeps the same amount of available traffic to handle, but the server continues rejecting requests with same rate as before (40%) of the received requests, the application of the algorithm again, results in increasing the drop rate to 14.5%, and sending to the server only 85.5% of the available traffic.\nThe value of the parameter K, along with the size of the time window during which the total number of \"requests\" and \"accepts\" is accounted for, has a fundamental role on how the algorithm behaves. If K is higher, the algorithm is more \"permissive\", and the client does not start dropping requests locally until the rejection rate is higher (e.g., >50%, for K = 2); if K is lower, the algorithm is more \"aggressive\", and the client starts dropping requests sooner (e.g., K = 1.1 implies to start dropping requests as soon as the server rejects >10% of the requests).\nAnnex B (normative):3gpp-Sbi-Callback Types\nThis annex specifies allowed 3GPP SBI callback type values for the \"3gpp-Sbi-Callback\" HTTP custom header specified in clause 5.2.3.2.3.\nTable B-1 contains a non-exhaustive list of callbacks that are invoked in the 5GS.\nTable B-1: Non-exhaustive list of values for the \"3gpp-Sbi-Callback\" Custom HTTP Header\nValue for \"3gpp-Sbi-Callback\" Custom HTTP Header\nReference\n\"Nsmf_PDUSession_Update\"\n3GPP TS 29.502 [28], Clause 5.2.2.8.3.2, 5.2.2.8.3.3, 5.2.2.8.3.4 and 5.2.2.8.3.5.\n\"Nsmf_PDUSession_StatusNotify\"\n3GPP TS 29.502 [28], Clause 5.2.2.10.\n\"Nudm_SDM_Notification\"\n3GPP TS 29.503 [29], Clause 6.1.5.2\n\"Nudm_UECM_DeregistrationNotification\"\n3GPP TS 29.503 [29], Clause 6.2.5.2\n\"Nudm_UECM_PCSCFRestorationNotification\"\n3GPP TS 29.503 [29], Clause 6.2.5.3\n\"Nnrf_NFManagement_NFStatusNotify\"\n3GPP TS 29.510 [8], Clause 6.1.5.2.\n\"Namf_EventExposure_Notify\"\n3GPP TS 29.518 [31], Clause 6.2.5.2.\n\"Npcf_UEPolicyControl_UpdateNotify\"\n3GPP TS 29.525 [35], Clauses 4.2.4, 5.5.2 and 5.5.3.\n\"Nnssf_NSSAIAvailability_Notification\"\n3GPP TS 29.531 [32], Clause 6.2.5.2\n\"Namf_Communication_AMFStatusChangeNotify\"\n3GPP TS 29.518 [31], Clause 6.1.5.2.\n\"Ngmlc_Location_EventNotify\"\n3GPP TS 29.515 [40], Clause 6.1.4.2.\n\"Nchf_ConvergedCharging_Notify\"\n3GPP TS 32.291 [42], Clause 6.1.5.2\n\"Nnssaaf_NSSAA_ReAuthentication\"\n3GPP TS 29.526 [44], Clause 6.1.5.2.\n\"Nnssaaf_NSSAA_Revocation\"\n3GPP TS 29.526 [44], Clause 6.1.5.3.\n\"N5g-ddnmf_Discovery_MonitorUpdateResult\"\n3GPP TS 29.555 [46], Clause 6.1.5.2.\n\"N5g-ddnmf_Discovery_MatchInformation\"\n3GPP TS 29.555 [46], Clause 6.1.5.3.\n…\n…\nFor notification and callback service operations (used across PLMNs or within a PLMN) that are not part of TableB.1, the value of the header shall be constructed as follows:\n\"<API name taken from the heading of the relevant annex A.x as defined in the corresponding 3GPP TS of that API>_<name of the callback service operation in the corresponding OpenAPI specification file>\"\nEXAMPLE:\tNsmf_PDUSession_smContextStatusNotification (for the Notify SM Context Status service operation)\nwhere the \"smContextStatusNotification\" correspond to:\ncallbacks:\nsmContextStatusNotification:\n'{$request.body#/smContextStatusUri}':\nNOTE:\tSeveral values in Table B-1 do not comply with the construction rule for the \"3gpp-Sbi-Callback\" HTTP header described in this clause; in those cases, the values explicitly included in Table B-1 take precedence over the construction rule.\nValues for the \"3gpp-Sbi-Callback\" Custom HTTP Header shall be case-insensitive.\nAnnex C (informative):Internal NF Routing of HTTP Requests\nThe internal details of the architecture of a Network Function instance is out of the scope of 3GPP and are entirely implementation-specific. This annex describes how an instance of an NF Service Producer can route internally HTTP requests received on a given Service-Based Interface.\nFigure C-1 illustrates an example component architecture where incoming HTTP requests are received and processed in a component named as \"Ingress Proxy\" module and route them to the appropriate computing resource in the NF.\nFigure C-1: Internal message routing inside NF Service Producer\nThe Ingress Proxy may parse any of the different components in the HTTP request, but typically it may parse the path of the URI (i.e. the :path pseudo-header in the HTTP/2 request). Parsing of other component in the request message, such as the HTTP body, is also possible but it is not desirable as it requires the parsing of the entire body (i.e. a JSON document) which is a much more computing-intensive task.\nThe path component of the URI contains the service name of the requested SBA service, so frequently the routing is done based on this component.\nIt is also frequent to inspect other components of the path (i.e. path segments), to do a more fine-grained routing and direct requests done on a specific HTTP resource(s) towards a given computing resource(s).\nIt can be noted that the path components used to determine the target computing resource typically do not need to be statically defined but are frequently defined in terms of \"variables\", or placeholders, similarly to how they are defined in the OpenAPI specification language (a mechanism usually known as \"path templating\"). See: https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#path-templating\nAnnex D (Normative):ABNF grammar for 3GPP SBI HTTP custom headers\nD.1\tGeneral\nThis Annex contains a self-contained set of ABNF rules, comprising the re-used rules from IETF RFCs, and the rules defined by the 3GPP custom headers defined in this specification (see clause 5.2.3).\nThis grammar may be used as input to existing tools to help implementations to parse 3GPP custom headers.\nGiven that this Annex is included in relation to ABNF tooling, the following aspects should be observed:\n-\tThe \"list extension\" rule defined in IETF RFC 9110 [11], section 5.6.1, is typically not supported by ABNF tooling, so rules included this syntax have been re-written with their equivalent syntax:\nRule1 = 1#element\nRule2 = #element\nis re-written as:\nRule1 = element *( OWS \",\" OWS element )\nRule2 = [ element *( OWS \",\" OWS element ) ]\n-\tThe ABNF specification defined in IETF RFC 5234 [43] does not describe how to evaluate the \"alternative\" operator (i.e., \"Rule1 / Rule2\"), when both rules match, but one of them have a \"longer\" match than the other. Based on existing ABNF rules in different RFCs, it seems that the approach is to apply a \"longest\" match (see, for example, the \"dec-octet\" rule in IETF RFC 3986 [14]); however, most existing ABNF tools apply a \"left-most\" match. When this occurs, the rules in this Annex have been re-written by placing the rule with a longest match on the left side, and the shortest match on the right side of the alternative operator.\nNOTE:\tThis ambiguity in the ABNF language has been identified in other IETF specifications, such as IETF RFC 3501; in that case, a requirement was added to the RFC (see section 9): \"In the case of alternative or optional rules in which a later rule overlaps an earlier rule, the rule which is listed earlier MUST take priority\".\nFor example:\nRule1 = \"imei\" / \"imeisv\"\nRule2 = DIGIT / ( \"1\" DIGIT ) ; allows an integer in the range 0-19\nis re-written as:\nRule1 = \"imeisv\" / \"imei\"\nRule2 = ( \"1\" DIGIT ) / DIGIT ; allows an integer in the range 0-19\n-\tThe rules containing prose text (\"<…>\") are typically not supported by ABNF tooling, so the rule in IETF RFC 3986 [14]:\npath-empty = 0<pchar>\nis re-written as:\npath-empty = 0pchar\n-\tSome rules in IETF RFC 9110 [11] (\"day\", \"month\", \"year\") contain the same rule names as in IETF RFC 5322 [37], so these clashing rule names in IETF RFC 9110 [11] have been renamed as \"day‑rfc9110\", \"month‑rfc9110\" and \"year‑rfc9110\" respectively.\nD.2\tABNF definitions (Filename: \"TS29500_CustomHeaders.abnf\")\n;
