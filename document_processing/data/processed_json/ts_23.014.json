The international recommendations which apply are ETSI ES 201 235 [3, 4, 5] as detailed in subclauses 6.2 and 6.3. For PCS 1900 for North America the Standards which apply are operator specific.\nIn the 3GPP system the MSC must support DTMF in the mobile to land direction.\nThe support of this facility in the land to mobile direction is for further study.\nThe use of DTMF is only permitted:\n-\t when the speech teleservice is being used or during the speech phase of alternate speech/data and alternate speech/facsimile teleservices; the DTMF is transmitted across the radio interface as specified in subclause 6 of this specification; and\n-\tduring a multimedia call; the DTMF is transmitted across the radio interface using the H.245 UserInputIndication message (see ITU-T H.245 [6]).

When the user completes the key depression, an message that the DTMF sending should cease is also passed to the MSC, which again will respond with an acknowledgement.",

This tone will remain connected until either the call is cleared or a STOP DTMF message is received.\nAs an operator option, the tone may be ceased after a pre-determined time whether or not a STOP DTMF message has been received.\nThe tones that are to be generated by the MSC are specified as follows:\n-\tFrequencies are defined in ETSI ES 201 235‑1 [3] (for PCS 1900 for North America this is operator specific);\n-\tTone sending levels are defined in ETSI ES 201 235‑2 [4] (for PCS 1900 for North America this is operator specific);\n-\tDurations as specified below.",
