The SEALDD function exhibits service-based interfaces which are used for providing and consuming SEALDD services. The service-based interface for SEALDD function is representation as Sdd.\nFigure 7.2-1 illustrates the service-based representation for utilization of the 5GS network services based on the 5GS SBA specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [5].\nFigure 7.2-1: Utilization of 5GS network services based on the 5GS SBA – service based representation\nThe SEALDD server acts as AF for consuming network services from the 3GPP 5G Core Network entities over the Service Based Architecture specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [5].\nFigure 7.2-2 illustrates the service-based representation for utilization of the Core Network (5GC, EPC) northbound APIs via CAPIF.\nFigure 7.2-2: Utilization of Core Network Northbound APIs via CAPIF – service based representation\nThe SEALDD server acts as authorized API invoker to consume services from the Core Network (5GC, EPC) northbound API entities like SCEF, NEF, SCEF+NEF which act as API Exposing Function as specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [3].\nThe mechanism for northbound APIs discovery using the service-based interfaces depicted in figure 7.2-3 is as specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [3].\nFigure 7.2-3 illustrates the architecture for SEAL Data Delivery enabler service.\nFigure 7.2-3 Architecture for SEAL Data Delivery Service\nThe SEALDD server can communicate with the control plane of 3GPP core network via N33/N5 interface with the SEALDD control plane functionality. The SEALDD server may consume other SEAL (e.g. NRM) services.\nFor uplink traffic, VAL client sends application data traffic to SEALDD client for SEALDD service over SEALDD-C. After data plane packet processing by SEALDD client, the application data traffic is converted to SEALDD data traffic and transferred to SEALDD server over SEALDD-UU. The SEALDD server restores the application data traffic and sends it to VAL server over SEALDD-S. For downlink traffic, VAL server sends application data traffic to SEALDD server for SEALDD service over SEALDD-S. After data plane packet processing by SEALDD server, the application data traffic is converted to SEALDD data traffic and transferred to SEALDD client over SEALDD-UU. The SEALDD client restores the application data traffic and sends it to VAL client over SEALDD-C. Optionally, VAL deployments may choose to route application signalling traffic and application data traffic for some or all functions it offers using SEALDD service and figure 7.2-4 illustrates the architecture for achieving this. In this case the VAL client and VAL server may choose not to maintain application connection by themselves and transfer all the application traffic over SEALDD connections for those functions. The data storage functionality may be provided by SEALDD server or provided by other storage functions in VAL server, or other cloud platform.\nNOTE 1:\tIt is up to the implementation of VAL server about which storage entity (e.g. VAL server, SEALDD server, or other cloud platform) is selected and used.\nNOTE 2:\tSEALDD capabilities are provided as APIs to the VAL Layer, it is up to VAL layer to decide which traffic to be transferred (e.g. application signalling, application data).\nFigure 7.2-4: Architecture for application traffic transfer\nThe SEAL Data Delivery client interacts with the SEAL data delivery server to establish application layer data transport path.\nThrough this path, the SEALDD server and client provides data transport service capabilities such as data plane packet processing (e.g. packet duplication, elimination or transport coordination), data forwarding, data caching, background data transfer, etc. to support the VAL server and VAL client. Annex C describes a typical lifecycle of SEALDD to establish the SEALDD connection for the VAL client and VAL server.",

SEALDD may also rely upon the EES Session with QoS API as specified in 3GPP TS 23.558 [10] and/or the NRM QoS functionality as described in 3GPP TS 23.434 [4].\nIf the DD policy specifies failure detection report, the SEALDD server may subscribe to CN analytics (e.g. DN performance analytics) from NEF/NWDAF and further notify data delivery status of application traffic to VAL client (via SEALDD client) and VAL server based on analytics result.\n4.\tThe SEALDD server allocates an IP address and port for sending and receiving packet over SEALDD-S reference point, then SEALDD server sends SEALDD connection establishment notification (i.e. SEALDD connection status notification with establishment event, as described in Table 9.2.3.9-1) to the VAL server with VAL service ID, the IP address and port.\n5-6.\tThe SEALDD server allocates an IP address and port for sending and receiving packet over SEALDD-UU reference point, then SEALDD server sends regular data transmission connection establishment request to the SEALDD client with SEALDD flow ID, VAL service ID, the IP address and port. The request is responded by the SEALDD client. UE IP address (and port) may be included by the SEALDD client in the response or sent in a separate update message by SEALDD client if a different UE IP address is to be used in SEALDD connection user plane.\nNOTE 2:\tStep 4 and step 5 can be done in parallel.\nNOTE 3:\tStep 5 can be sent via PDU session (if exist) or via application triggering (if no PDU session exists).\n7.\tThe SEALDD client further notifies the VAL client about the SEALDD connection being established.\nUpon receiving application traffic from VAL client (not shown in the figure), the SEALDD client sends it to SEALDD server in SEALDD traffic. The SEALDD server identifies application traffic based on the VAL service ID and further sends the application traffic to VAL server. The downlink application traffic sent from VAL server to VAL client is processed similarly.",

      "content": "Figure 9.3.2.1-1 illustrates the procedure for redundant transmission establishment. This procedure can be triggered by a VAL server for data transfer per application layer transaction.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe VAL server has discovered and selected the SEALDD server by CAPIF functions as specified in clause 9.4.2.\nFigure 9.3.2.1-1: E2E redundant transmission path establishment\n1.\tThe VAL server decides to use SEALDD service to help ensuring data transmission quality for application traffic transfer and send a Sdd_URLLCTransmission request to the SEALDD server discovered by CAPIF. The request includes UE ID, VAL server ID, VAL service ID, SEALDD-S Data transmission connection information of the VAL server side, and optionally, the QoS information for the application traffic, e.g. QoS requirements. The VAL server ID and VAL service ID can be used to identify the VAL application traffic.\n2.\tUpon receiving the request, the SEALDD server decides to establish redundant transmission path. The SEALDD server allocates two different addresses or ports for the two redundant transmission paths and sends an AF request to 5GS to create or update URSP rules as described in clause 4.15.6.10 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [6] for the UE(s) going to use the redundant transmission service. The AF request includes Identifiers of the UE(s) and application traffic descriptor containing the addresses or ports allocated by SEALDD server. The SEALDD server may send the AF request to provide the required QoS information to 5GC via N33/N5, as defined in clause 5.2.6.9 and in clause 5.2.5.3 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [6].\n3.\tIf the processing of the request was successful, SEALDD server allocates address/port of the SEALDD server to receive the packets from the VAL server for application data transfer as SEALDD-S data transmission connection information of the SEALDD server side. The SEALDD server responds with a SEALDD service response (including SEALDD-S data transmission connection information of the SEALDD server side) and indicates to the VAL server that redundant transmission service should be activated. The VAL server and SEALDD server can use SEALDD-S data transmission connection information to establish the data transmission connection between VAL server and SEALDD server for application data transfer.\n4.\tIf the redundant transmission requirement is not preconfigured or notified to the VAL client, the VAL server may notify the VAL client(s) which is going to use the redundant transmission service through application layer message.\nNOTE 1:\tThe application signalling may be transmitted via direct application layer connection or via the SEALDD layer.\nNOTE 2:\tThe VAL client can be preconfigured that the VAL service should always be transmitted via redundant transmission. Or this application layer notification may be notified to the UE in another period before the VAL application traffic is really transmitted.\n5.\tThe VAL client sends a SEALDD service request to use E2E redundant transmission for the application traffic.\n6.\tThe SEALDD client discovers and selects the proper SEALDD server for the VAL application as specified in clause 9.4.3. After this step, the SEALDD client can get the SEALDD server's address.\n7.\tThe SEALDD client allocates a SEALDD flow ID mapping to the application traffic. The SEALDD client sends Sdd_URLLCTransmissionConnection_Establish request to SEALDD server. The request includes the SEALDD client ID, SEALDD flow ID, VAL server ID, VAL service ID for SEALDD server to identify the specific application traffic.\n8.\tUpon receiving the request, the SEALDD server sends SEALDD traffic descriptor for redundant transmission of the SEALDD server side (i.e. the addresses or ports for the redundant transmission paths allocated in step 2 and the transport protocol used for the SEALDD traffic) to SEALDD client.\n9.\tThe UE uses the SEALDD traffic descriptor of the SEALDD server and the created or updated URSP rules to trigger two redundant PDU Sessions establishment procedure via 5GS as specified in clause 5.33.2.1 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [5].\n10.\t[Optional] The SEALDD client sends Sdd_URLLCTransmissionConnection_Update request to SEALDD server. The request includes the SEALDD client ID, the SEALDD flow ID, the SEALDD traffic descriptors for redundant transmission of the SEALDD client side (i.e. UE addresses and ports of the two redundant PDU Sessions). The two redundant SEALDD traffic use the same SEALDD flow ID for identification.\n11.\t[Optional] The SEALDD server sends a response to SEALDD client. After this step, the SEALDD client and SEALDD server both get the whole SEALDD traffic descriptors (including the UE's addresses/ports and SEALDD server's addresses/ports for the SEALDD traffic transmission). The SEALDD client and SEALDD server store the mapping between the application traffic and SEALDD traffic.\n12.\t[Optional] If the connection between VAL server and SEALDD server is not established in step 3, the SEALDD server establishes connection with VAL server for the VAL client to transmit application traffic mapping to the redundant SEALDD traffic according to the SEALDD-S information negotiated in step 1-3\nNOTE 3:\tStep 10 and Step 11 are optional. If the redundant PDU sessions are already established before step 7, the IP addresses of the UE may be notified to the SEALDD server in step 7. In other cases, after the establishment of the two redundant PDU sessions, the SEALDD client may communicate with SEALDD server through the redundant PDU sessions to let the SEALDD server know the UE's address(es) of the redundant PDU session to fulfil the traffic mapping or the SEALDD client and SEALDD server may use other mapping mechanisms, it is up to the transport protocol used by SEALDD client and SEALDD server for the SEALDD traffic.\n13.\tThe SEALDD client responds with a SEALDD service response.\nAfter the negotiation and establishment of the connections, the SEALDD client gets the mapping information between the application traffic and SEALDD flow ID. The SEALDD server gets the mapping information between the SEALDD flow ID and the SEALDD-S connection. Upon receiving application traffic from VAL client, the SEALDD client duplicates the application packets and maps them into two SEALDD traffic flows with SEALDD traffic descriptors as negotiated with SEALDD server in step 8 and step 11. The two SEALDD traffic is sent through two redundant PDU sessions to the SEALDD server. The SEALDD server maps the two SEALDD traffic to the same application traffic according to the stored SEALDD traffic descriptors, SEALDD client ID and SEALDD flow ID. After packet elimination and reordering the SEALDD server sends the aggregated application traffic to VAL server via the connection established in step 3 and step 12 according to the mapping information. The downlink application traffic sent from VAL server to VAL client is processed similarly.",

If SEALDD is not adapted to EDGEAPP, for UE mobility, the SEALDD client can discover (e.g. using DNS) a new SEALDD server in the target area and establish a new SEALDD communication channel including the old SEALDD communication channel information. For load re-balance, the SEALDD server can discover (e.g. using DNS) an equivalent SEALDD server and communicate with the new SEALDD server.\nBased on existing service continuity mechanism supported by 3GPP core network (e.g. BP/ULCL), during SEALDD server relocation with UPF change, the new UPF takes care of the existing unfinished application traffic flow towards the old VAL server and inter-UPF tunnel is used to forward the traffic. For new application traffic flow which may have UE's new IP address as source IP address, the new SEALDD server sends it directly to the new VAL server.\nFor SEALDD server relocation, the inter-SEALDD server communication via SEALDD-E reference point is needed, which transfers the SEALDD context from the old SEALDD server to the new SEALDD server.\nThe following procedures detail the EDGEAPP ACT part between old SEALDD server (i.e. S-EAS) and new SEALDD server (i.e. T-EAS) as described in 3GPP TS 23.558 [10], clause 8.8.2.2 to clause 8.8.2.6.

Any of the ACR scenarios detailed in 3GPP TS 23.558 [10] clauses 8.8.2.2-8.8.2.6 may occur. In this step, the first three phases of the ACR procedure are performed, up to ACT. In this step VAL Server 1 acts as EAS 1 and VAL Server 2 as EAS 2, therefore participating in corresponding signaling.

The associated SEALDD server 2 has also been selected and may support transportation layer (e.g. UDP/TCP/QUIC) service continuity.\n5a.\tBefore triggering ACT, VAL Server 1 sends a SEALDD notification of ACR event to SEALDD Server 1.\n5b.

The SEALDD client and SEALDD server is enhanced to carry out the data transmission quality measurement.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe SEALDD server and SEALDD client are synchronized to the time source provided by 5GS as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [5].\n2.\tThe VAL server discovers and selects the SEALDD server by CAPIF functions.\nFigure 9.7.2.1-1: SEALDD enabled data transmission quality measurement procedure\n1.\tAn on-going regular data transmission connection is established according to clause 9.2.2.2.\n2.\tThe VAL server sends a SEALDD transmission quality measurement subscription request to the SEALDD server. The request includes the identifiers of the application traffic (e.g. VAL service ID, VAL server ID), requirement of transmission quality measurement (e.g. latency, jitter, bitrate, packet loss rate) and measurement target UE (e.g. a single UE, a group of UEs or all UEs), and may also include reporting criteria, reporting frequency, spatial condition and temporal condition.\nNOTE:\tThe spatial and/or temporal condition can be used by SEALDD server to apply when and where the measurement is performed. For instance, the measurement is expected to be done for a group of VAL UEs with a scheduled route (from city A to city B via highway A2 and A3), from 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. on Tuesday and from 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. on Thursday.\n3.\tUpon receiving the request, the SEALDD server performs an authorization check. If authorization is successful, the SEALDD server sends a response to the VAL server with the subscription ID, expiration time.\n4.\tIf the transmission quality measurement requirement list provided by VAL server in step 2, indicates that the latency is needed to be measured, the SEALDD server initiates the DL packet delay measurement. The SEALDD server encapsulates the DL monitoring packet (i.e. DL SEALDD packet with SEALDD DL monitoring header and VAL traffic as payload, or dummy DL SEALDD packet generated for data transmission quality monitoring) with local time T1 when the SEALDD server sends out the DL monitoring packets. The SEALDD server considers the spatial and/or temporal conditions when starting/resuming the transmission quality measurement. If the conditions are not satisfied, the SEALDD server stops/suspends the transmission quality measurement.\nNOTE:\tFor other metrics in transmission quality measurement requirement list (e.g. bitrate), the transmission quality result can be obtained by performance detection on the SEALDD server within a period of time.\n5.\tThe SEALDD client receives the DL monitoring packet, and records the local time T2.\n6.\tSimilarly, the SEALDD client encapsulates the UL monitoring packet (i.e. UL SEALDD packet with SEALDD UL monitoring header and VAL traffic as payload, or dummy UL SEALDD packet generated for data transmission quality monitoring) with local time T2 recorded in step 5 and local time T3 when the SEALDD client sends out the UL monitoring packet.\n7.\tThe SEALDD server records the local time T4 when the SEALDD server receives the UL monitoring packet and calculates the latency with T1, T2, T3, T4. The SEALDD server can also calculate the bitrate, jitter and packet loss rate over a certain period over a specific SEALDD connection by recording the status of the SEALDD packets carrying VAL traffic or dummy SEALDD packets generated for transmission quality measurement reports. The SEAL DD server also evaluates the reporting criteria if present in the SEALDD transmission quality measurement subscription request in order to generate the transmission quality measurement report.\n8.\tThe SEALDD server reports the data transmission quality measurement results (e.g. latency, jitter, bitrate, packet loss rate) to the VAL server via the notification message.\nWhen a VAL group ID or a list of VAL UE IDs or all VAL UEs indication is received in step 2, step 4 to step 7 is repeated for VAL UEs in the group/list or for all VAL UEs. The SEALDD server maps the VAL UE group ID to a list of VAL UE IDs if a VAL group ID is received. The SEALDD server identifies SEALDD connections corresponding to the desired VAL UE(s) to trigger measurement. And depending on the reporting requirement for multiple UEs, the SEALDD server calculates the needed report for the VAL server. When the VAL server decides to update or unsubscribe transmission quality measurement subscription after performing step 2 and step 3, the VAL server can send data transmission quality measurement subscription update request and data transmission quality measurement unsubscribe request to SEALDD server, as specified in Table 9.7.3.9-1 and Table 9.7.3.11-1, respectively.",

The policy can be used to configure measurements and determine the necessary SEALDD layer actions for meeting the service policy requirements.\n2. The SEALDD Client is authorized to request redundant transport services on behalf of the VAL client.\nFigure 9.9.2.2-1: SEALDD data transmission quality guarantee with redundant transmission\n1.\tA VAL client and server establish a SEALDD connection to transport the application data. As part of the connection establishment, the SEALDD service policy in precondition 1 is shared so that it is available to both the SEALDD client and the SEALDD Server. The SEALDD Server may use the data transmission quality requirements of this policy in conjunction with other local policies pre-provisioned at the SEALDD server. The SEALDD server determines whether to start data transmission quality measurement by itself or by the SEALDD client. As a result, SEALDD measurements (e.g. packet loss rate, latency) are configured either at the SEALDD client as described in clause 9.7.2.3 or at the SEALDD server as described in clause 9.7.2.1 and started accordingly. Then either the SEALDD client or server receives measurement reports.\n2.\tBased on measurement reports and the SEALDD service policy, depending on the which entity started the measurement, either the SEALDD client or server determines to perform an action so that the data transmission quality requirements of the policy are met.\n3.\tSpecifically, if the measurement was started by the SEALDD client, the SEALDD client triggers the establishment of redundant transmission services. If the measurement was started by the SEALDD server, the SEALDD server triggers the establishment of redundant transmission services by sending a Transmission quality management request to the SEALDD client requesting to establish redundant transmission path.\nNOTE:\tThe request can be sent to SEALDD client via Application Triggering (specified in clause 4.13.2 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [6]) with payload indicating a trigger of a redundant connection setup for SEALDD packet transmission.\n4.\tThe SEALDD client uses steps 6 to 9 of the procedure in clause 9.3.2.1 to request the use of redundant transmission service from the SEALDD server. As part of this step, the UE may end the initial PDU session and establish redundant PDU sessions.\n5.\tThe SEALDD client updates the SEALDD connection with the redundant transmission information, i.e., the UE addresses and ports for the redundant PDU sessions, the SEALDD flow identifier, and the application traffic descriptors. The SEALDD client or server also configures the parameters for enabling any necessary SEALDD measurements for the new SEALDD flow.\n6.\tThe SEALDD server may subscribe to receive notifications from the 5G network for user plane measurements (e.g., the network latency requirements specified in 3GPP TS 28.541 [12]), network analytics (as specified in 3GPP TS 28.104 [11], etc.).\n7.\tThe SEALDD client and server handle data duplication and elimination of application traffic on the redundant SEALDD flows and the necessary measurements are collected by the SEALDD client or server.\nWhen the SEALDD measurement results indicating that the SEALDD data transmission has good performance according to policy guarantee threshold, if the measurement was started by the SEALDD client, the SEALDD client may release one transmission path and return back to single SEALDD connection mode, otherwise the SEALDD server may send a Transmission quality management request to the SEALDD client requesting to use single transmission, then the SEALDD client releases one transmission path and returns to single SEALDD connection mode.",

In the context of SEALDD service the following rules apply:\n-\tThe SEAL server is the SEALDD server;\n-\tThe SEAL-S reference point is the SEALDD-S reference point; and\n-\tThe SEAL-E reference point is the SEALDD-E reference point.\nAnnex B (Informative):Message delivery option: Utilizing MSGin5G\nB.1\tGeneral\nMSGin5G provides a data delivery messaging service in 5GS especially for enabling IoT device communications. It has been specified starting with Rel-17 in 3GPP TS 23.554 [9]. SEALDD is proposed as a generic data delivery enabler layer for all the verticals utilizing SEAL. It is beneficial to deploy one unified data delivery system suitable for all kinds of terminals to reduce the complexity of vertical applications.\nB.2\tSEALDD utilizing MSGin5G\nMSGin5G functionalities described in 3GPP TS 23.554 [9] are integrated in SEALDD enabler layer. As shown in Figure B.2-1, MSGin5G client functionality is integrated in SEALDD client, and MSGin5G server functionality is integrated in SEALDD server. SEALDD server and SEALDD client can use MSGin5G functionalities to send SEALDD traffic in MSGin5G message format.\nFigure B.2-1 SEALDD utilizing MSGin5G\nAnnex C (Informative):Overall lifecycle of SEALDD service\nFigure C-1: Overall lifecycle of SEALDD\nAs shown in Figure C-1, the whole lifecycle of SEALDD to establish the SEALDD connection for the VAL client and VAL server includes two phases:\n1.\tSEALDD server Service Preparation Phase (This Phase is used by the VAL server to get SEALDD server prepared for SEALDD client access):\n(1)\tWhen the VAL server decides to use the SEALDD service for data transmission enhancement, it discovers the SEALDD server (e.g. by CAPIF).\n(2)\tThen the VAL server triggers SEALDD service subscription procedure to the discovered SEALDD server, in that procedure, SEALDD server is associated with the VAL server, and specific SEALDD server resource (e.g. address/port of the SEALDD server for redundant transmission) is allocated for the VAL server's service to transfer SEALDD traffic.\n(3)\tFor EDN scenario, the SEALDD server or VAL server will register the association information to the EES.\n2.\tSEALDD client Service Consuming Phase (When SEALDD server is prepared in SEALDD server Service Preparation Phase, the VAL client(s) can trigger SEALDD client to connect to specific prepared SEALDD server for SEALDD service):\n(1)\tWhen VAL client request to use SEALDD service to transmit the VAL traffic to VAL server, the VAL client or SEALDD client can discover the proper SEALDD server associated with the VAL server (e.g. via EAS discovery, DNS query, pre-configuration or Application layer signalling).\n(2)\tThen SEALDD client can interact with SEALDD server to negotiate for SEALDD data transfer. If Address/Port is allocated in SEALDD service subscription phase, it will be notified to SEALDD client in this step.\n(3)\tData transmission connection is established between the SEALDD client and SEALDD server for SEALDD traffic transfer.\n(5)\tThe whole configuration is accomplished and the VAL traffic is transferred via the SEALDD connection.\nAnnex D (informative):Change history\nChange
