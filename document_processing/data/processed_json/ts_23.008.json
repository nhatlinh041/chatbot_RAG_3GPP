Whether storage of data is performed internally or externally is out of scope of this specification.\nIn addition, subscriber data may also be stored in the following functional unit:\n-\tGroup Call Register (GCR) which contains all data required for configuration, set-up and handling of voice group and voice broadcast calls. This encompasses subscribers identities (mobile as well as fixed network) who are nominated as dispatchers for one or several groups within the area controlled by the GCR.\nNOTE 3:\tThe data stored in the GCR is not strictly \"subscriber data\". Description of GCR data is therefore out of scope of this specification and is covered in the corresponding specifications for enhanced Multi Level Precedence and Pre-emption Service (eMLPP), Voice Group Call Service (VGCS) and Voice Broadcast Service (VBS) instead (3GPP TS 23.067 [12], 3GPP TS 43.068 [33] and 3GPP TS 43.069 [34]).\nNOTE 4:\tThe MME, SGSN and ePDG Emergency Configuration Data, which are applied for all emergency bearer services, are not subscriber data and therefore out of the scope of this specification.
