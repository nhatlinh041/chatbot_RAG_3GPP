When and how often an Echo Request message may be sent is implementation specific but an Echo Request shall not be sent more often than every 60 s on each path.\nAn MME or an HRPD access node shall be prepared to receive an Echo Request at any time and it shall reply with an Echo Response.  The optional Private Extension contains vendor or operator specific information.\n3GPP TS 29.274 [6] specifies the information elements included in the Echo Request message.\n7A.2.3\tEcho Response message\nThe message shall be sent as a response to a received Echo Request.\n3GPP TS 29.274 [6] specifies the information elements included in the Echo Response message.\nThe Recovery information element contains the local Restart Counter (see subclause 9.3) value for the node that sends the Echo Response message.\nIn this release of the specification, the MME and HRPD access node do not need to determine whether the peer node has restarted or not, i.e. they may ignore the Recovery information element.\nThe optional Private Extension contains vendor or operator specific information.\n7A.2.4\tVersion Not Supported Indication message\nThis message contains only the S121 header and indicates the latest S121 version that the MME or HRPD access node entity on the identified UDP/IP address can support (see 3GPP TS 29.274 [6] subclause 7.1.3).\n3GPP TS 29.274 [6] specifies the detailed handling and information elements included in the Version Not Supported Indication message.\n7A.3\tS121 Messages\n7A.3.1\tIntroduction\nThe following message is used to support RIM information exchange between the MME and the HRPD Access Network:\n-\tRIM Information Transfer\n7A.3.2\tRIM Information Transfer\nThe RIM Information Transfer message shall be sent on the S121 interface between MME and the HRPD Access Network to transfer RIM information between an eNodeB and the HRPD Access Network (see 3GPP TS 23.402 [2]).\nFor handling of protocol errors the RIM Information Transfer message is treated as a Response message.\nTable 7A.3.2-1 specifies the information elements included in the RIM Information Transfer message.\nTable 7A.3.2-1: Information Elements in a RIM Information Transfer\nInformation elements\nPresence Requirement\nReference\nInstance\nS121 Transparent Container\nMandatory\n7A.5.2\n0\nRIM Routing Address\nMandatory\n7A.5.3\n0\nPrivate Extension\nOptional\n7A.5.4\nVS\nThe S121 Transparent Container information element shall contain encapsulated RIM Information exchanged between the MME and the HRPD Access Network, i.e. all information elements from the BSSGP RIM PDU, starting from and including the BSSGP \"PDU type\" (see 3GPP TS 48.018 [15]).\nThe RIM Routing Address IE shall identify the destination RAN node where the RIM information needs to be sent to.

See 3GPP TS 29.274 [6] but with S121 node replacing GTPv2-C node as appropriate.\nNOTE:\tIn this release of the specification, the MME and HRPD access node do not need to and can not determine whether the peer node has received the RIM Information Transfer message.\n7A.5\tInformation Elements\n7A.5.1\tInformation Element Assignments\nAn S121 message may contain several information elements.
