      "content": "This document defines the stage 2 service description for emergency services in the IP Multimedia Core Network Subsystem (IMS), including the elements necessary to support IP Multimedia (IM) emergency services and IM emergency services for eCall. ITU‑T Recommendation I.130 [4] describes a three-stage method for characterisation of telecommunication services, and ITU‑T Recommendation Q.65 [3] defines stage 2 of the method.\nThis document covers also the Access Network aspects that are crucial for the provisioning of IMS emergency services. Other 3GPP specifications that are related to the IMS emergency services are TS 23.228 [1] on IMS in general, including fixed broadband access aspects, TS 23.060 [2] describing GPRS (UTRAN): TS 23.401 [28] describing EPS (UTRAN and E-UTRAN); TS 23.402 [29] describing Non 3GPP access (WLAN) to EPC; TS 23.271 [5] that covers location services; TS 23.216 [31] and TS 23.237 [32] describing Single Radio Voice Call Continuity (SRVCC) and Dual Radio Voice Call Continuity (DRVCC) for IMS Emergency session, TS 23.292 [45] describing the use of IMS services when using CS access for the media bearer and TS 23.501 [48] and TS 23.502 [49] describing support of emergency services and location for 5GS. TS 25.301 [6] contains an overall description of the UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network; TS 36.300 [30] contains an overall description of the Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA) and Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN); and TS 38.300 [50] contains an overall description of the Next Generation Radio Access Network (NG-RAN). Other non-3GPP specifications that are related to the IMS emergency services include 3GPP2 cdma2000 HRPD IP‑CAN, as specified in 3GPP2 X.S0060 [25] when the UE is connected to a PDS core network and 3GPP2 X.S0057‑A [39] when the UE is connected to an EPC core network.\nThe emergency support in different IP-CANs is described in the Informative Annex E.",

A term defined in the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905 [11].\nCharging Data Record: Record generated by a network element for the purpose of billing a subscriber for the provided service. See TS 32.260 [35] for further details.\nConnectivity Session Location and Repository Function (CLF): As per ETSI ES 282 004 [18], the Connectivity Session Location and Repository Function (CLF) registers the association between the IP address allocated to the UE and related network location information, i.e.: access transport equipment characteristics, line identifier (Logical Access ID), IP Edge identity.\nNG-eCall (eCall Over IMS): A manually or automatically initiated IMS emergency call, from a vehicle, supplemented with a minimum set of emergency related initial data (MSD).\nEmergency Call Server (ECS): The functional entity consists of a Location Retrieval Function (LRF) and either a routing proxy or a redirect server, e.g. an ECS contains a VPC and a Routing Proxy or Redirect Server in NENA I2 architecture [17].\nEmergency‑CSCF: The Emergency‑CSCF handles certain aspects of emergency sessions, e.g. routing of emergency requests to the correct emergency centre or PSAP.\nEmergency Service Query Key (ESQK): A 10-digit North American Numbering Plan number used to identify a particular emergency call instance. It is used by the LRF as a key to look up for the location information and callback information associated with the emergency call instance and is also used by the PSAP to query location information from the LRF.\nEmergency Service Routing Key (ESRK): see TS 23.271 [5] or J‑STD‑036 [23].\nEmergency Service Routing Number (ESRN): North American Numbering Plan number used for routing of an emergency call to the appropriate gateway for an eventual delivery towards a CS-based PSAP.\nGeographical Location Information: Location indicated in geographical terms, for example geographical coordinates or street address (e.g. as supported by IETF RFC 4119 [14]).\nLocal regulation: Condition defined by the authority whose legislation applies where the emergency service is invoked.\nLocation Identifier: Information about the current location of the UE in the network. Location is indicated in network terms, for example using the global cell id in cellular networks, line-id in fixed broadband networks, (OMA-Location also uses this term, but OMA so far defines the Location Identifier only for cellular access.)\nLocation Information: The location information may consist of the Location Identifier, and/or the Geographical location information.\nLocation Retrieval Function (LRF): This functional entity handles the retrieval of location information for the UE including, where required, interim location information, initial location information and updated location information. The LRF may interact with a separate RDF or contain an integrated RDF in order to obtain routing information. The LRF may interact with a separate Location Server or contain an integrated Location Server in order to obtain location information. The LRF may interact with or contain other types of location server functions in order to obtain location information.\nLocation Server (LS): General term for the entity responsible for obtaining the location of the UE (e.g. GMLC see  TS 23.271 [5], MPC see 3GPP2 X.S0002 [24] or SLP see OMA AD SUPL [15]).\nLast Routing Option (LRO): A number, which may be used in the event of network failure towards a specific location based PSAP or a number that can be associated to a national or default PSAP/Emergency centre.\nOperator policy: Condition set by operator.\nPrivate Numbering Plan: According to ETSI TS 181 019 [36], a numbering plan explicitly relating to a particular private numbering domain.\nPublic Safety Answering Point (PSAP): A physical location, where emergency calls from the public are received.\nRouting Determination Function (RDF): The functional entity, which may be integrated in a Location Server or in an LRF, provides the proper PSAP destination address to the E‑CSCF for routing the emergency request. It can interact with a LS to manage ESQK allocation and management, and deliver location information to the PSAP.\nStand-alone Non-Public Network: A non-public network not relying on network functions provided by a PLMN.\nFor the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions given in TS 24.229 [19] apply:\nPrivate Network Traffic\nNOTE:\tAll traffic from UEs having registered a contact bound to a public user identity receiving hosted enterprise services, is private network traffic.\nPublic Network Traffic\nFor the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions given in TS 23.401 [28] apply:\neCall Only Mode: See TS 23.401 [28].\nFor the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions given in TS 22.101 [8] apply:\neCall: See TS 22.101 [8].\nMinimum Set of Data (MSD): See TS 22.101 [8].",

      "content": "The solution for emergency sessions in the IMS fulfils the emergency principles and requirements of TS 22.101 [8], TS 22.228 [27] and the following architectural requirements:\n1.\tVoid.\n2.\tEmergency services are independent from the IP-CAN with respect to the detection and routing of emergency sessions. The emergency services shall be possible over at least a cellular access network (terrestrial or satellite), a fixed broadband access, a nomadic access and a WLAN access to EPC or non-3GPP access to 5GC.\n2a.\tEmergency numbers and associated types or URN information received via WLAN (for access to EPC) are only used for detecting emergency calls in the same country, if permission from PLMN selected in 3GPP access was received (see TS 23.401 [28] and TS 23.060 [2] for EPC access).\nNOTE 1:\tSome features described in this clause do not apply for emergency session set-up over WLAN access to EPC or to 5GC. The limitations are documented in Annex J and Annex L.\n2b.\tEmergency numbers and associated types received using a list as described in TS 24.008 [13] are only used for detecting emergency calls in the same country. The UE can obtain these numbers and associated types via mobility management procedures as described in TS 24.008 [13], TS 24.301 [33] and TS 24.501 [52]. The associated types consist of a limited number of emergency service categories from which a limited number of URNs can be derived.\n2c.\tEmergency numbers and associated URN information received using a list as described in TS 24.301 [33] are only used when they are valid. The validity of these numbers and associated URN information is specified in clause 10.4.1 of TS 22.101 [8] (i.e. the serving network indicates whether this list is valid in the country or only in the PLMN or SNPN). The UE can obtain these numbers and associated URN information via mobility management procedures as described in TS 24.301 [33] and TS 24.501 [52].\n3.\tAny kind of emergency numbers, and emergency SIP and TEL‑URIs as specified in TS 22.101 [8], and special indications for emergency sessions within the SIP signalling shall be supported. The URIs allowed to resolve to emergency services may be subject to local regulation in the serving network.\n4.\tEmergency sessions should be prioritized over non-emergency sessions by the system.\n5.\tThe establishment of IMS emergency sessions shall be possible for users with a barred public user identity.\n6.\tThe primary solution shall be that the UE can detect an emergency session (e.g. by evaluating the SIP-URI or the dialled number) by itself and indicates the emergency session to the network. The cases where the UE can't detect an emergency session shall also be supported.\n7.\tThe solution shall work if the UE has sufficient credentials to authenticate with the IMS and is registered to the IMS or is not registered with the IMS. The case where the UE does not have sufficient credentials to authenticate with the IMS shall also be supported if required by local regulation.\nIn the case that UE is not already IMS registered, it shall perform a registration for the support of emergency services (emergency registration).\nIn the case a UE is already IMS registered, the UE may skip the additional emergency registration if the UE is aware that it is in its home network (e.g. including IP-CANs where roaming outside the home network is not supported).\nIf the UE does not have sufficient credentials to authenticate with the IMS it shall be possible to perform session establishment without an existing security association between UE and P‑CSCF, and the UE shall include an equipment identifier (the specific details of the equipment identifier to use may depend upon the IP-CAN) in the request to establish an emergency session.\nSubject to local regulation or operator policy, the network and the UE shall support the same authentication and security methods for an emergency service request as for non-emergency requests.\n8.\tIt shall be possible to reject emergency service requests from an UE, without sufficient credentials to authenticate with the IMS in networks where emergency services from UEs with sufficient credentials to authenticate with the IMS are required.\n9.\tEmergency Service is not a subscription service.\n9a.\tWhen the UE has roamed out of its home network, emergency services shall not be provided by the home network and shall be provided in the roamed-to network if the roamed-to network supports emergency sessions. If a UE has sufficient credentials, it shall initiate an emergency registration with the network (requiring the involvement of the home network). The CSCFs providing service for emergency sessions may be different from the CSCFs involved in the other IMS services. If the registration fails and if the serving IMS has indicated support for anonymous IMS emergency sessions as part of the IMS registration failure, the UE shall attempt an anonymous emergency session. If the IMS registration fails and if the serving IMS has not indicated support for anonymous IMS emergency sessions as part of the IMS registration failure, the UE may attempt an anonymous IMS emergency session.\nNOTE 2:\tUEs compliant with pre-Rel‑14 versions of this specification are unable to interpret this indication and ignore the indication. Such UEs might attempt an anonymous IMS emergency session or proceed according to Annex H.5.\n10.\tIf an emergency session establishment request is routed to a P‑CSCF located in the home network, the home network should be able to detect that the session is for emergency service (whether indicated as such or not) and respond to the UE indicating that the UE should initiate an emergency session in the visited network (e.g. via the CS domain of the visited network).\n11.\tEmergency centres and PSAPs may be connected to the PSTN, CS domain, PS domain or any other packet network.\n12.\tThe architecture shall enable emergency centres and PSAPs to request a PSAP call back to a UE with which the Emergency centres or PSAPs had an emergency session.

PSAP call back is subject to local regulation.\nNOTE 3:\tPSAP call back sessions are treated as normal calls.\nNOTE 4:\tSubject to local regulation, any supported media can be used during a call back attempt from a PSAP.\n13.\tThe IMS core network shall be able to transport information on the location of the subscriber.\n14.\tVoid.\n15.\tThe network shall be able to retrieve the caller's location;\n16.\tAs a regional option, the network shall be capable of assigning a routable location key (i.e. Emergency Services Query Key, a.k.a. ESQK, which has the same properties as the existing ESRK in wireless 911 services) to an IMS emergency session, and releasing the ESQK when the emergency session is terminated.\n17.\tThe network shall provide the caller's location information to the PSAP upon query from the PSAP.\n18.\tThe network shall provide the possibility to route to a default answering point given the scenario where the local PSAP can not be determined.\n19.\tThe network may provide a capability to enable a UE to obtain local emergency numbers.\n20\tA UE should support a capability to obtain local emergency numbers from the network once such a capability has been defined and agreed.\n21.\tThe network (e.g. in the E‑CSCF) shall prevent the sending of the information of the users, such as public user identifiers and the location information, to the PSAP if explicitly requested by the user (i.e. request on session by session basis), and local regulation requires the operator to provide privacy to the user.\n22.\tVoid.\nNOTE 5:\tTS 24.008 [13] contains a procedure to provide local emergency numbers for UMTS and GPRS access but the procedure is not applicable to cdma2000 HRPD and contains a limited number of emergency service categories.\n23.\tVoid.\n24.\tSubject to operator policy, the architecture shall allow an emergency session to be initiated by a trusted AS on behalf of a user that is not roaming.\n25\tSubject to local regulation, for non-roaming subscribers the network shall apply normal routing procedures for private network traffic even if that is marked as emergency session.\n26.\tWhen a call is established with a PSAP that supports voice only, voice media is supported and GTT if required by local regulation or operator policy.\n27.\tWhen a call is established with a PSAP that supports voice and other media, voice, GTT and other media according to TS 22.101 [8] (e.g. video, session mode text-based instant messaging) can be used during an IMS emergency session if required by local regulation. This media may be used in addition to or instead of voice and/or GTT.\n28.\tNG-eCall is a variant of IMS emergency services and follows the same principles, architecture, and procedures as other emergency services over IMS.\n29.\tAn originating network that is processing an emergency session shall, if configured through operator policies, invoke an AS for the signing of attestation and identity information and Resource-Priority information, if available in the incoming request. The originating network shall include the signed information in the outgoing emergency request.\n30.\tA network serving a UE receiving a PSAP call back shall, if configured through operator policies, invoke an AS for the verification of signed caller identity information, and Resource-Priority information, if available in the incoming request.\nIn addition to the architectural requirements, the following architectural principles apply to IMS emergency sessions:\n-\tThe IMS network shall be able to discriminate between emergency sessions and other sessions. This shall allow special treatment (e.g. with respect to filtering, higher priority, routing, QoS, supplementary services interactions) of emergency sessions.\n-\tIf a visited network can support PS emergency service, the emergency session shall be established in the visited network whether or not UE is registered in IMS in the home network.\n-\tWhen a UE using public network traffic initiates an emergency session, the P‑CSCF is the IMS network entity, which is responsible to detect the request for emergency session. The P-CSCF then forwards the request to E‑CSCF in the same network, unless authentication and security procedures (see principle #7) require the request to be forwarded to the S-CSCF in the same network.\nNOTE 6:\tWhile in the home network, forwarding of an emergency session to the S-CSCF is only expected over a non-emergency registration.\n-\tThe P‑CSCF serving the emergency call is the IMS network entity which may retrieve the location identifier from the IP-CAN. For emergency sessions initiated by a trusted AS on behalf of a non-roaming subscriber, the AS may provide the location identifier.\n-\tThe P‑CSCF serving the emergency call is the IMS network entity which may receive additional caller related identifier(s) from the IP-CAN (e.g. IP-CAN level's subscriber ID). If required by local regulation, these additional identifier(s) shall be forwarded by the IMS network to the emergency control centre/PSAP for those UEs that have not been authenticated by IMS network and are requesting to establish an emergency session,\n-\tThe E‑CSCF is the IMS network entity, which shall be able to retrieve geographical location information from the LRF in the case that the geographical location information is not available and is required.\n-\tIf required, the E‑CSCF shall be able to forward the location information to the LRF for validation of geographical location information in the case that the geographical location information is included by the UE over any access network type.\n-\tThe E‑CSCF is the IMS network entity, which is responsible to route the request to an emergency centre/PSAP via or BGCF, IBCF or IP multimedia network based on location information and additionally other information such as type of emergency service in the request.\n-\tAs a regional option where the emergency centre/PSAP is connected to the IMS of another network (e.g. TTC spec), emergency sessions may be routed over Inter-IMS Network to Network Interface between two IM CN subsystem networks.\n-\tThe architecture shall allow for compliance with other regional regulations (i.e. ATIS and NENA specs in North America region) in which the originating network shall have the ability to route an emergency call via an IBCF to an emergency services network.",

The location information may consist of network location information, that is the Location Identifier, and/or the Geographical location information.\nNOTE 1:\tFor untrusted non-3GPP access to 5GC, provided location information can only correspond to the UE IP address seen by the N3IWF and used for traffic destined towards the UE.\nNOTE 2:\tFor NR satellite access to 5GC, an NR CGI (NCGI) provided in the location information by the UE can differ from the NCGI provided by NG-RAN and the area indicated by the former NCGI can differ from the area indicated by the latter NCGI.\n-\tThe P‑CSCF may query the IP‑CAN to obtain location identifier.\n-\tIf a trusted AS is used for the emergency session, the AS may provide the location identifier.\n-\tWhen an emergency session is coming from a private network, it is assumed that the private network includes the initial location information in the request to establish an emergency session and subsequent location information as requested.\nThe E‑CSCF, if required, may query the LRF for additional location information. If the E‑CSCF does not receive location information in the emergency service request, it may query the LRF for location information.\n-\tThe E‑CSCF shall be able to query the LRF to validate the location information if provided initially by the UE.\n-\tFor WLAN access, the LRF may query HSS for NPLI if the UE is not roaming. In some regions, for example in the North American region [45], if the BSSID of the serving WLAN is available, the LRF may query a database subject to national regulations and operator policies for the dispatchable location associated with the BSSID of the WLAN Access Point.\n-\tThe E‑CSCF routes the emergency request to the PSAP/Emergency Centre that corresponds to the type of emergency service requested and to the type of emergency service requested and to the current location of the UE or to a default PSAP/Emergency Centre. The access dependent variations of this approach are described in the respective access specific annexes, for the cases where the UE is using GPRS (UTRAN), EPS (UTRAN and E-UTRAN), 5GS (NG-RAN), fixed broadband access, WLAN access to EPC or non-3GPP access to 5GC for the emergency service.\n-\tThe E‑CSCF forwards the SIP request containing the UE's location information to the PSAP/Emergency Centre via PS domain or via BGCF/MGCF through the CS domain. The location information can contain explicit location information and/or a reference key to allow the PSAP to retrieve location at a later stage.",

Step 2 to 6 may be skipped based on the conditions specified in clause 6.1.\n2.\tIn the case that the UE has insufficient resources or capabilities to establish an emergency call due to other ongoing sessions then the UE should terminate the ongoing communication and release reserved bearer resources.\n3.\tIn the case that bearer registration is required and has not been performed, the UE shall perform bearer registration to the IP-CAN. If the UE is already bearer registered, then the bearer registration procedures are not required to be performed.\nNOTE 1:\tDepending on the IP-CAN, the UE may be assigned an IP address at this stage.\n4.\tIn the case that bearer resources for the transport of the IMS related signalling are required to be reserved in the IP-CAN, the UE shall reserve the resources in the IP-CAN. The IP‑CAN may support a UE indication that this request is for an emergency service.If the IP-CAN does not provide an IP address to the UE in step 3, then the IP-CAN shall allocate an IP address to the UE during the bearer resource request procedures.\n5.\tUE performs a P‑CSCF discovery procedure, where the UE discovers a P‑CSCF in the local network suitable for use in emergency sessions.\nNOTE 2:\tThe exact means for the P‑CSCF discovery is dependent upon the IP-CAN.\n6.\tIf the UE has sufficient credentials to authenticate with the IMS network, it shall initiate an IMS emergency registration by providing the IP address obtained at step 3 or step 4 to the P‑CSCF selected at step 5. The IP address used for signalling purposes is allocated in association with step 3 or step 4. The IMS registration request shall include an emergency indication. The implicit registration set of the SIP URI used in the emergency registration request used by the UE when the UE performs a non-emergency registration shall contain an associated TEL‑URI that is used to call back the UE.\nThe S‑CSCF may set the proposed registration expiration according to the local regulation or operator policy of the serving system. The subsequent registration flows are like any other registration with the considerations defined in clauses 6.2.4 and 6.2.9.\nIf the UE does not have sufficient credentials to authenticate with the IMS network, it shall not initiate an IMS emergency registration request, but instead immediately establish an emergency session towards the P‑CSCF as described in clause 7.4 and skip step 7.\n7.\tThe UE shall initiate the IMS emergency session establishment using the IMS session establishment procedures containing an emergency service indication, or the eCall type of emergency service indication in the case of eCall and any registered Public User Identifier. If the UE has performed emergency registration, the UE shall use an emergency registered Public User Identifier.\nWhether the procedures are activated individually by the UE or some of them are performed automatically depends on the implementation of the terminal and on the UE's configuration.

      "content": "When performing an emergency service, four scenarios for retrieving location information for routing purposes are considered:\n-\tthe UE knows its own location;\n-\tthe UE retrieves its location information from the network;\n-\tthe IMS core retrieves the location information. The related high level procedures are described below;\n-\tlocation information is not needed to route the emergency call by the IMS core, optionally the emergency routing determination and location information retrieval may be performed by the Emergency Call Server (ECS) as part of the emergency session establishment procedure. In this case, the IMS core does not need to obtain the location information. See the details in Annex D.\nFigure 7.6-1: Handling of location information in IMS emergency calls\n1.\tThe user initiates an emergency call.\n2.\tThe UE determines its own location or location identifier if possible. If the UE is not able to determine its own location, the UE may, if capable, request its location information from the IP-CAN, if that is supported for the used IP-CAN. If applicable, the IP-CAN delivers to the UE the UE's geographical location information and/or the location identifier.\n3.\tThe UE sends an INVITE with an emergency indication to the IMS core. The INVITE should contain any location information that the terminal has. The location information may be geographical location information or a location identifier, which is dependent upon the access network technology. If the UE is not able to provide any location information, the IMS core may seek to determine the UE's location from the LRF as described below. The INVITE may optionally contain information concerning the location solutions and position methods supported by the UE.\nNOTE:\tThe location solutions and position methods conveyed in the INVITE and the means of inclusion in the INVITE are outside the scope of this specification.\n4.\tIf the location information provided in step 3 is trusted and sufficient to determine the correct PSAP, the procedure continues from step 7 onwards. If the location information is insufficient or if the IMS core requires emergency routing information, or if the IMS core is required to validate the location information, or if the IMS core is required to map the location identifier received from the UE into the corresponding geographical location information, the IMS core sends a location request to the LRF. The request shall include information identifying the IP-CAN and the UE and may include means to access the UE (e.g. UE's IP address). The request shall also include any location information provided by the UE in step 2. The request may optionally include any information concerning the location solutions and position methods supported by the UE.\n5.\tThe LRF may already have the information requested by IMS core or LRF may request the UE's location information.\n5a.\tThe means to obtain the location information may differ depending on the access technology the UE is using to access the IMS. The SUPL procedures defined in OMA AD SUPL: \"Secure User Plane Location Architecture\" [15], OMA TS ULP: \"User Plane Location Protocol\" [16], may be used if supported by the terminal and if it is possible to establish a user plane connection between the UE and the SUPL server. Information provided in step 4 concerning the location solutions and position methods supported by the UE may optionally be used by the LRF to help determine the means to obtain the location information.\n5b.\tIf configured to provide an NPLI for WLAN access, and if the UE is not roaming, the LRF queries HSS for every access the LRF is configured for. The LRF issues a separate query for every access. If the LRF cannot obtain an NPLI, it shall invoke procedure 5a.\nThe LRF may invoke an RDF to convert the location information received in step 4 or obtained in step 5a into PSAP routing information, but LRF's interactions with RDF are out of scope of the present specification. The LRF may store the location information, but only for a defined limited time in certain regions, according to regional requirements.\n6.\tThe LRF sends the location information and/or the routing information to the IMS core. The LRF may also return correlation information (e.g. ESQK) identifying itself and any record stored in step 5a.\n7.\tThe IMS core uses the routing information provided in step 6 or selects an emergency centre or PSAP based on location information provided in step 3 or 6 and sends the request including the location information and any correlation information and possibly location information source, e.g., positioning method that was used to obtain the location information to the emergency centre or PSAP.\n7a.\tThe INVITE is sent to an MGCF/MGW;\n7b.\tThe IAM is continued towards the emergency centre or PSAP; or\n7c.\tThe INVITE is sent directly to the emergency centre or PSAP.\n8.\tThe emergency call establishment is completed.\n9.\tThe PSAP may send a location request to the LRF to get the initial location information for the target UE, or to request LRF to get updated, i.e. current, location information for the target UE. The PSAP may determine the LRF based on the location and/or correlation information received in step 7. The PSAP may also include the correlation information in the request to the LRF.\n10.\tDepending on the access type, UE location is determined as follows:\n10a.\tFor non WLAN-access and optionally for WLAN access, the LRF determines the target UE's location using one of the means listed in step 5a above. The LRF may use the correlation information received in step 9 to retrieve information about the UE that was stored in step 5a.\n10b.\tFor WLAN access, the LRF may use the correlation information received in step 6 to send a request to the IMS core to retrieve a UPLI from the UE. The IMS core uses the emergency call signalling channel for that purpose. Steps 10b1 to 10b4 depict this procedure. If UPLI is not available when the request comes to the UE (e.g. due to insufficient time), and UPLI cannot be returned, the UE may also provide UPLI once, when available by executing step 10b3 following step 8.\n10c.\tFor WLAN access, and if the LRF is configured to provide an NPLI for WLAN access, and if the UE is not roaming, the LRF queries HSS for every access the LRF is configured for. The LRF issues a separate query for every access. If the LRF cannot obtain an NPLI, it shall invoke procedure 10a.\n11.\tThe LRF returns the initial or updated location information to the emergency centre or PSAP. As an option for initial location, the LRF may instigate the location step 10a before the request in step 9 is received and may send the initial location to the emergency centre or PSAP either after the request in step 9 is received or before it is received.\n12.\tThe emergency call is released.\n13.\tThe IMS core may indicate to the LRF that the call is released. The LRF deletes any record stored in step 5a.",

The call flow is applicable following establishment of an emergency services session for eCall as described in clause 7.1.1 in which the initial MSD is transferred in the INVITE and prior to release of the emergency services session.\nFigure 7.7.3-1: Sending an updated MSD for eCall\n1.\tIf the emergency centre or PSAP requires an MSD update, it may send a request for MSD to the IMS Core.\n2.\tThe IMS Core shall forward the request to the UE.\n3.\tThe UE shall send the most recent MSD to the IMS Core.\n4.\tThe IMS Core shall forward the MSD to the emergency centre or PSAP.\nNOTE:\tWhether an acknowledgement message for the successful receipt of updated MSD by the PSAP is further provided to the UE is resolved in stage 3 level.\nAnnex A (informative):Void\nAnnex B (informative):Void\nAnnex C (normative):IMS emergency services using Fixed Broadband Access\nC.1\tLocation Retrieval for emergency services over fixed broadband access\nThese procedures described in this annex apply when the IP-CAN contains a Network Attachment Subsystem with a CLF as specified in ETSI ES 282 004 [18].\nC.1.1\tHigh Level Principles for Emergency location information for fixed broadband access\nIn addition to the architecture described in clause 5.1 above, the P‑CSCF may have an interface to an LRF which may contain a CLF as described below in figure C.1. For more information on the CLF refer to ETSI ES 282 004 [18].\nFigure C.1: Additional P‑CSCF interface for fixed broadband access\nFor fixed broadband access, the UE may know its own network location or geographical location. If the UE knows its location, it shall insert the location information in the SIP INVITE request when establishing the emergency IMS session.\nAs an alternative, if the UE is not able to determine its own location, the UE should try to request its location from the access network, if the UE supports such functionality. The access network may know the location of the access point where the UE is connected to. In this case, the UE should request the location information from the access network according to clause 7.6. The UE shall insert the location information received as a response to the location query, if any, in the emergency SIP INVITE request. This location information may be network based, e.g. line identification, or geographical location information.\nIf the UE does not know its location and is unable to obtain its location from the access network, the UE should have a means to indicate in the emergency SIP INVITE that its location is unknown.\nIf the UE does not provide location information, the P‑CSCF may request location information from the LRF as described in clause 7.6 and insert the location information in the received INVITE request. The IMS network may also request location information from the LRF in the case that verification of the location information provided by the UE is required. After such verification, the IMS network may insert the location information received from the LRF or override the location information received from the UE before routing the request to the PSAP.\nAlternatively, subject to operator policy, the S-CSCF may receive from the HSS a reference location of the user at registration, and insert it in the INVITE request, when network-provided location information is not already present. The reference location (e.g. line identification) is determined by the operator as part of the user profile.\nNOTE:\tThe reference location alternative is applicable to non-nomadic services provided on fixed lines for emergency sessions that are routed through the S-CSCF (see clause 6.2.4). The reference location corresponds the physical location of the fixed line.\nC.1.2\tRetrieval of location information for emergency services over fixed broadband access\nIn addition to clause 7.6, the following applies for a fixed broadband access:\n-\tWhen the UE is requesting to retrieve the location information from IP-CAN, the UE may use the DHCP option for coordinate-based geographic location of the client as specified by IETF in RFC 3825 [9] and the DHCP option that allows hosts to learn their civic location via DHCP, as specified in RFC 4676 [10]. This DHCP option shall not be used by an UE on an IP-CAN using 3GPP RAT.\n-\tThe line identifier used by the UE with fixed broadband access may be authenticated by the IMS core.\nAnnex D (informative):Examples of call flows according to NENA I2 recommendations\nThis clause provides the examples of call flows according to NENA I2 recommendations [17].\nD.1\tECS redirecting IMS emergency call\nFigure D.1\nThis flow is supported by the procedures in clause 7.3, where the E‑CSCF need not enquire the LRF for location information. Additional steps defined here are standard SIP methods, but not defined in this specification.\nDetailed description of the procedure:\n1)\tAn IMS emergency call is initiated.\n2)\tThe E‑CSCF sends an Invite message with 911 or other well-known emergency number as the dialled number, the UE's location information in a Location Object (LO) if available, and the UE's media capabilities encapsulated in a SDP payload, to the ECS.\n3)\tBased on the received Location Object (LO), the ECS will determine to which PSAP/EC the call should be routed and allocate an ESQK from the ESQK pool associated with that particular PSAP/EC. The ECS then will format a SIP response with the retrieved ESRN/ESQK in the Contact fields to redirect the emergency call.\n4)\tThe IMS Core uses the ESRN/ESQK received in the call redirect message to format an INVITE message properly, and sends it to the MGCF/MGW. A P-Asserted-Identity field may be inserted in the INVITE message, it contains either an ESQK or the CBN.\n5)\tThe emergency call setup continues with the PSAP/EC.\n6)\tThe ECS initiates a subscription at the IMS Core to request a notification of call termination of the emergency call.\n7)\tAn acknowledgement is returned.\n8)\tThe emergency session establishment signalling continues.\n9)\tThe PSAP retrieves location from the ECS.\n10)\tThe emergency session is released.\n11)\tThe IMS Core sends an Event Notification message to the ECS with an Event indicating that the 911 call has been terminated. At this time, the ESQK allocated to the emergency session can be released.\n12)\tAn acknowledgement is returned to the IMS Core.\nD.2\tECS routes the emergency call to the gateway with record route\nFigure D.2\nThis flow is supported by the procedures in clause 7.3, where the E‑CSCF need not enquire the LRF for location information.\nDetailed description of the procedure:\n1)\tAn IMS emergency call is initiated.\n2)\tThe E‑CSCF sends an Invite message with 911 or other well-known emergency number as the dialled number, the UE's location information in a Location Object (LO) if available, and the UE's media capabilities encapsulated in a SDP payload, to the ECS.\n3)\tBased on the received Location Object (LO), the ECS will determine to which PSAP/EC the call should be routed and allocate an ESQK from the ESQK pool associated with that particular PSAP/EC. The ECS then re-issues an Invite to an appropriate MGCF/MGW with the ESRN/LRO, ESQK and a record route indication. or the call to be routed to PSAP the P-Asserted-Identity contains ESQK, A P-Asserted-Identity field may be inserted in the INVITE message, f for the call to be routed to other emergency answering centre the P-Asserted-Identity contains the CBN.\n4)\tThe emergency call setup continues with the PSAP/EC.\n5)\tThe emergency session establishment signalling continues.\n6)\tThe PSAP retrieves location from the ECS.\n7)\tEither the caller or PSAP initiates the call termination signalling.\n8)\tThe E‑CSCF or MGCF/MGW forwards the hang-up message to the ECS. At this time, the ESQK allocated to the emergency session can be released.\n9)\tThe ECS sends an OK to the E‑CSCF or MGCF/MGW.\n10)\tThe call termination signalling continues.\nAnnex E (informative):Emergency support in different IP-CANs\nSupport for emergency services in the IP Multimedia Core Network can be provided by certain IP-CANs according to table E.1, which shows the level of possible emergency support in this version of the specification. The UE may be able to use also other IP-CANs that are not included in table E.1 to access emergency services in the IP Multimedia Core Network, but the support of such access technologies is out of scope of this specification.\nTable E.1: Support for IMS Emergency Services by Different IP-CANs\nIP-CAN\nNormal Access\nEmergency support\nInsufficient Security Credentials\nGPRS (UTRAN)\nX\nX\nX\nFixed Broadband\nX\nX\nX\ncdma2000 HRPD/PDS\nX\nX\nX\ncdma2000 HRPD/EPC\nX\nX\nX\nEPS (UTRAN and E-UTRAN)\nX\nX\nX\nWLAN access to EPS\nX (NOTE 1)\nX\n-\n5GS (NG-RAN)\nX\nX\nX\nnon-3GPP access to 5GC\nX (NOTE 1)\nX\n-\nNOTE 1:\tEmergency Sessions use a normal access to EPC/5GC only in the case of emergency sessions not detected by the UE and nevertheless served by the IMS network.\nThe term \"normal access\" in table E.1 means that the IP-CAN is not made aware of the UE intent to establish an emergency services session and therefore provides no special emergency support e.g. call priority.\nThe term \"emergency support\" in the table means that the IP-CAN is made aware of the UE intent to establish an emergency services session, or at least of the priority nature of the access, so that the access network is able to handle the emergency call with appropriate priority.\nThe term \"insufficient security credentials\" in the table means that the IP CAN is able to allow a UE with no UICC card or a UICC card with insufficient credentials to obtain IP bearer access for emergency services in the IP Multimedia Core Network.\nAnnex F (normative):IMS Emergency Services Using HRPD/PDS Network\nF.1\tcdma2000 HRPD/PDS Options\nThe following options from the normative clauses of this TS are applicable in cdma2000 HRPD systems with a PDS core network:\n1)\tClause 7.1.1, step 4 \"The IP-CAN may support a UE indication that this request is for an emergency service\".\nThe following options from the normative clauses of this TS are not applicable in cdma2000 HRPD/PDS systems:\n1)\tClause 4.1 \"The P‑CSCF serving the emergency call is the IMS network entity which may retrieve the location identifier from the IP‑CAN\".\nF.2\tRequirements on the HRPD Network as an IP-CAN\nFor an emergency call over HRPD, the requirements on the IP‑CAN are specified in 3GPP2 X.S0060 [25].\nF.3\tInformation Flows\nThe informational flows for emergency calls over HRPD are provided in 3GPP2 X.S0060 [25].\nAnnex G (informative):TEL‑URI provisioning considerations for IMS emergency call back\nIn order to support emergency call-back from the PSTN or CS Domain:\n-\tFor a single or multiple device subscription that contain both a SIP‑URI and TEL‑URI in at least one implicit registration set for each device (including subscriptions that share SIP-URIs and TEL‑URIs between devices), IMS emergency sessions can already be supported. If the user registers with a temporary public user identity (e.g. the subscription has a device containing a USIM) ensure that a TEL‑URI is provisioned in the same implicit registration set as the temporary public user identity.\n-\tFor a multiple device subscription that has TEL‑URIs for some devices but has one or more devices that are not assigned an implicit registration set containing a TEL‑URI (e.g. because these devices in the subscription are not allowed to use a TEL‑URI in normal originations), the existing TEL‑URIs in the subscription cannot be shared between all devices for the purposes of IMS emergency sessions.\nAnnex H (normative):IMS emergency services using UTRAN, E-UTRAN and NG-RAN radio access network\nH.1\tGeneral\nThis annex includes additional requirements and clarifications when the IP-CAN is a PS Domain supporting UTRAN, E-UTRAN or NG-RAN radio access network.\nNOTE:\tFor SNPN, as defined in TS 23.501 [48] the only supported RAT is NR and there is no support for Emergency Services Fallback.\nIf a PLMN supports other emergency numbers than those listed in TS 22.101 [8], the UE is connected to the PLMN using UTRAN, E-UTRAN or NG-RAN radio access network and the UE needs to know these other emergency numbers, then such emergency numbers shall be provided to the UE via the mobility management procedures as described in TS 24.301 [33], TS 24.008 [13] and TS 24.501 [52].\nIf an SNPN supports other emergency numbers than those listed in TS 22.101 [8], the UE is connected to the SNPN using NR access and the UE needs to know these other emergency numbers, then such emergency numbers shall be provided to the UE via the mobility management procedures as described in TS 24.501 [52].\nFor registration requests received from an emergency PDN connection or emergency PDU session, the P-CSCF shall reject any IMS registration which is not for the emergency purpose.\neCall is supported with E-UTRAN and NG-RAN for PLMNs only, i.e. eCall is not supported for SNPNs. UE configured for eCall Only Mode can receive a PSAP call back for a limited duration following the termination of the eCall due to its specific mobility management procedures requirement as defined in TS 22.101 [8].\nH.2\tUE specific behaviour\nFor the specific case where the UE has selected to make an emergency call over EPS, GPRS or 5GS the UE shall use the following procedures:\n-\tA UE shall establish an emergency PDN connection or emergency PDU session and perform an IMS emergency registration before initiating a UE detectable emergency session via UTRAN, E-UTRAN or NG-RAN.\n-\tA UE shall not establish an emergency PDN connection or emergency PDU session if the UE initiated a non UE detectable emergency session and is subsequently informed by the network that the ongoing session is an emergency session.\nNOTE 1:\tIf SRVCC is required in the network, an operator could download the local emergency numbers to avoid non UE detectable emergency sessions since UTRAN and E-UTRAN will not be able to identify emergency SRVCC handling without an emergency PDN connection.\n-\tIf the UE initiates a non UE detectable emergency session, and the session initiation request is rejected by the P‑CSCF with an indication that this is an emergency session, the UE shall select a domain according to the requirements for domain priority and selection in clause H.5 when applying the requirements in clause 7.1.2.\n-\tA UE in 5GS shall not initiate establishment of an IMS emergency session over Non-3GPP access unless the emergency session could not be established via 3GPP access.\n-\tIf the UE has not been authenticated in the PS domain, the UE shall initiate an IMS emergency session establishment without registration according to clause 7.4.\n-\tThe UE shall include the latest available Cell Global Identification (CGI) in the IMS emergency request establishing the emergency call.\n-\tWhen the UE is using NR satellite access to 5GC, the UE shall include an indication of NR satellite access in the IMS request.\nNOTE 2:\tWhen using UTRAN, the UE is not always able to read the current cell identity and in some cases the UE can be connected to several cells simultaneously.\nNOTE 3:\tFor NR satellite access to 5GC the NR CGI (NCGI) available to the UE and the NCGI provided from NG-RAN to 5GC might be different. The NCGI provided by the UE might not relate to the UE's geographic location. A P-CSCF relying only on the UE provided NCGI could then lead to errors.\n-\tIf the UE is required to include an equipment identifier (according to clauses 4.1 and 6.1) the equipment identifier shall be the IMEI.\n-\tFor the media supported during IMS emergency sessions in clause 10.4 of TS 22.101 [8], media codec and format support is specified in TS 26.114 [34].\n-\tUE shall only perform eCall procedure over IMS as specified in clause 7.7.1 when it detects the \"eCall supported\" indication as defined in TS 23.401 [28] and TS 23.501 [48].\n-\tWhen PS access is available, but the UE does not detect the \"eCall supported\" indication as defined in TS 23.401 [28] and TS 23.501 [48], and there is no CS access available, the UE shall establish a regular IMS emergency call.\n-\tIf the broadcast indicators in an E-UTRA cell connected to 5G and EPC as defined in TS 23.501 [48] indicate only one core network (EPC or 5GC) supports emergency services then the UE shall register to the core network which supports emergency services when the UE initiates emergency services. If broadcast indicators indicate that both 5GC and EPC support emergency services then the UE initiates emergency services to either EPC or 5GC according to the UE implementation.\n-\tIf the broadcast indicator in an NR cell indicates that the cell provides access to SNPNs and that 5GC supports emergency services, the UE shall only register to the core network of the SNPN that indicates support for emergency services. If broadcast indicators indicate that one or more SNPNs and/or PLMNs support emergency services, then the UE initiates emergency services to either a SNPN or a PLMN according to UE implementation.\nH.3\tHigh Level Procedures for IMS emergency calls\nFor the high level procedures (as described in clause 7.1.1) the following statements apply for UE detected emergency calls when PS domain with UTRAN, E-UTRAN or NG-RAN access is used:\n-\tthe bearer registration to the IP-CAN is the PS attach or PS Registration procedure;\n-\tthe IP-CAN bearer resource is the PDP context for GPRS, EPS Bearer for EPS and QoS Flow for 5GS, and TS 23.060 [2], TS 23.401 [28] and TS 23.501 [48] respectively describe how to indicate that the request is for emergency;\n-\tthe release of reserved bearer resources is the release of a PDP context, an EPS Bearer or a QoS Flow.\nFor the high level procedures (as described in clause 7.1.2) the following statements apply for Non UE detectable emergency calls when PS domain with UTRAN, E-UTRAN or NG-RAN access is used:\n-\tThe P-CSCF rejects the session initiation request with an indication that this is an emergency session; or\n-\tthe P-CSCF allows the session initiation request to continue and the E-CSCF informs the UE that it is an emergency session. Such a session will not use an emergency PDN connection or emergency PDU session and will not have SRVCC or SRVCC for IMS emergency session support.\nFor the IMS Emergency Session Establishment without Registration (as described in clause 7.4), P-CSCF retrieves the additional subscriber related identifier(s) from IP-CAN via PCC in TS 23.203 [20] when PS domain with UTRAN and E-UTRAN access is used.\nH.4\tLocation handling\nThe applicable location solutions are specified in TS 23.271 [5] for control plane with UTRAN and E-UTRAN access, in TS 23.501 [48] and TS 23.502 [49] for control plane with NG-RAN access and in SUPL 2.0 (OMA AD SUPL[15], OMA TS ULP [16]) for user plane. For SUPL, SUPL Initiation Function using UDP/IP (OMA AD SUPL [15]) shall be supported by the SET.\nIf the operator policy requires network provided location using PCC-based solutions for the UE location (e.g. serving cell), the P-CSCF retrieves location information from the access network and includes it in the emergency service request, as described in TS 23.228 [1]. The UE location is marked as being network provided to distinguish it from location information that the UE provided.\nIf the operator policy requires network provided location using the LRF-based solution for the UE location (e.g. serving cell), the P-CSCF forwards the emergency request to E-CSCF. The E-CSCF retrieves location information from LRF as described in clause 6.2.2.\nOperator policies in the P-CSCF and E-CSCF should be aligned to ensure that the E-CSCF doesn't attempt to retrieve location information from the LRF if network-provided location information is present in the initial emergency request. However, as described in clause 6.2.2, the E-CSCF may request the LRF to retrieve additional location information (e.g. the UE's geographical location information).\nH.5\tDomain Priority and Selection Rules for Emergency Session Attempts\nThis clause details the domain priority and selection (see clause 7.3) for UE that attempts to make an emergency session for UTRAN, E-UTRAN or NG-RAN radio access networks based on the UE attach status to CS or PS domains and the network support for IMS emergency and IMS voice over PS.\nThe following table (Table H.1) defines these rules based on the UE (last 2 columns) for different initial conditions (first 4 columns) when an emergency session is initiated and when the UE is not in limited service state.\nNOTE:\tThe behaviour of the UE in limited service state is defined in e.g. TS 23.122 [41], TS 36.304 [58] and TS 38.304 [54] and is supported by the broadcast of the ims-EmergencySupport bit (see TS 36.331 [55]; TS 38.331 [56]). The behaviour is that a UE supporting voice services performs cell reselection to a cell that does support emergency voice calls.\nFor NG-eCall (eCall over IMS) domain selection in clause H.6 applies. This clause is not applicable for NG-eCall.\nWhen a 5G ProSe enabled UE (as specified in TS 23.304 [53]) does not have direct connection to the network for emergency service, the UE can obtain emergency service via 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay as specified in Annex M.\nTable H.1: Domain Selection Rules for emergency session attempts for UTRAN, E-UTRAN or NG-RAN radio access networks\nCS Attached\n(NOTE 9)\nPS Attached\nVoIMS\nEMS\nFirst EMC Attempt\nSecond EMC Attempt\nA\nN\nY\nY\nY\nPS\nCS if available and supported (NOTE 7, NOTE 8)\nB\nN\nY\nN\nY\nPS or CS if the emergency session includes at least voice.\nPS if the emergency session contains only media other than voice.\nPS if first attempt in CS\nCS if first attempt in PS (NOTE 7, NOTE 8)\nC\nN\nY\nY or N\nN\nPS if ESFB is \"Y\" (NOTE 5).\nElse CS or PS for another 3GPP RAT with EMS or ESFB set to \"Y\" if available and supported and if the emergency session includes at least voice.\nElse PS for another 3GPP RAT with EMS or ESFB set to \"Y\" if available and supported if the emergency session contains only media other than voice.\nPS if first attempt in CS\nCS if first attempt in PS (NOTE 7, NOTE 8)\nD\nY\nN\nY or N\nY or N\nCS if the emergency session includes at least voice.\nPS if available and EMS or ESFB is \"Y\" and emergency session contains only media other than voice.\nPS if available and EMS or ESFB is \"Y\"\nE\nY\nY\nY\nY\nIf the emergency session includes at least voice, follow rules in TS 22.101 [8] which say to use the same domain as for a non-EMC (NOTE 2)\nPS if the emergency session contains only media other than voice.\nPS if first attempt in CS\nCS if first attempt in PS\nF\nY\nY\nY or N\nN\nPS if ESFB is \"Y\" (NOTE 5).\nElse PS for another 3GPP RAT with EMS if available and supported or CS, if the emergency session includes at least voice.\nCS if first attempt in PS\nPS for another 3GPP RAT if available and supported and EMS or ESFB is \"Y\" if first attempt in CS.\nG\nY\nY\nN\nY\nCS if the emergency session includes at least voice.\nPS if the emergency session contains only media other than voice.\nPS\nEMC =\tEmergency Session. EMC includes also normal calls initiated in the CS domain that are treated by the CS CN as emergency calls.\nVoIMS =\tVoice over IMS over PS sessions support as indicated by IMS Voice over PS session supported indication as defined in TS 23.401 [28], TS 23.060 [2] and TS 23.502 [49].\nEMS =\tIMS Emergency Services supported as indicated by Emergency Service Support indicator as defined in TS 23.401 [28], TS 23.060 [2], TS 23.501 [48] and TS 23.502 [49].\nESFB =\tEmergency Services Fallback for 5GS as defined in TS 23.501 [48] and TS 23.502 [49].\nNOTE 1:\tIf the UE selects the CS domain and initiates a normal call using the dialled local emergency number (see clause 7.1.2), and the UE enters limited service state (e.g. due to a Location Registration failing), then the UE camps on an acceptable cell (see TS 23.122 [41]) and may proceed with the EMC by initiating an emergency call in limited service state.\nNOTE 2:\tUse of the same domain as for a non-EMC is restricted to UTRAN, E-UTRAN and NG-RAN access (e.g. excludes WLAN).\nNOTE 3:\tThis NOTE applies to a UE in dual registration mode as defined in TS 23.501 [48]. A dual registration mode UE that is registered to both EPC and 5GC assumes attachment, for the purpose of the \"PS Attached\" column, to whichever of EPC or 5GC indicates EMS as \"Y\". When both EPC and 5GC indicate EMS as \"Y\", the UE shall assume attachment to either EPC or 5GC based on implementation. A UE that is registered to both EPC and 5GC does not use emergency services fallback and ignores the ESFB condition when performing domain selection.\nNOTE 4:\tThe other 3GPP RAT for row C and row F can be any of UTRA, E-UTRAN connected to EPC, E-UTRA connected to 5GC or NR connected to 5GC that is supported by the UE and differs from the RAT to which the UE is currently attached in the PS domain (or is assumed to be attached based on NOTE 3).\nNOTE 5:\tThe condition 'ESFB is \"Y\"' only applies for a UE that is camped on or connected to 5GS via NR or via E-UTRA and that supports Emergency Services Fallback. In that case the emergency call will be provided over E-UTRAN or E-UTRA connected to 5GC as defined in procedures in TS 23.502 [49]. The condition 'ESFB is \"Y\"' is taken into consideration by the UE only when the network has indicated EMS = \"N\" for the RAT on which the UE is camping or connected.\nNOTE 6:\tFor 5GS, the value of the column \"EMS\" is for the RAT that UE is camped on or is connected to.\nNOTE 7:\tAs an implementation option, when the first attempt uses PS and fails for reasons other than related to IMS, the second attempt may use PS with a different 3GPP RAT. In this case the UE can make a third attempt using CS.\nNOTE 8:\tAs an implementation option, when the first attempt uses PS and fails because the first discovered P-CSCF is not available, additional attempts may use PS with alternate P-CSCFs (see clause E.1.1.1 of TS 23.228 [1] and clause 4.3.2.2.1 of TS 23.502 [49]). In this case the UE can make an attempt using CS after making failed PS attempts on all discovered alternate P-CSCFs.\nNOTE 9:\tWith E-UTRAN access, \"CS attached\" means that the UE has performed a combined Attach/TAU and has been accepted by the network for EPS and non-EPS services. If the UE has been accepted for EPS and \"SMS-only\" then, for the purposes of this table, the UE should behave as if it is not CS attached.\nH.6\teCall over IMS\nThis clause details the domain priority and selection (see clause 7.3) for a UE that attempts to make an eCall over IMS session using E-UTRAN or NG-RAN radio access networks based on the availability of the CS or PS domains and the network support for IMS emergency, eCall over IMS and IMS voice over PS.\nThe following table (Table H.2) defines these rules based on the UE (last 2 columns) for different initial conditions (first 4 columns) when an eCall over IMS session is initiated.\nTable H.2: Domain Selection Rules for eCall over IMS session attempts for E-UTRAN or NG-RAN radio access networks\nPS Available\nVoIMS\nEMS\nECL\nFirst eCall Attempt\nSecond eCall Attempt\nA\nY\nY\nY\nY\nPS\nPS on another PS RAT if available with EMS=Y and ECL=Y\nor CS if available\nB\nY\nY\nY\nN\nCS if available\nPS (UE establishes IMS emergency session)\nC\nY\nY or N\nN\nN\nCS if available\nPS on another PS RAT if available with EMS=Y or EMS unknown\nD\nY\nN\nY\nY\nPS or CS if available\nCS if first attempt in PS\nPS if first attempt in CS\nE\nY\nN\nY\nN\nCS if available\nPS (UE establishes IMS emergency session)\nF\nN\n-\n-\nCS if available\nVoIMS\t=\tVoice over IMS over PS sessions support as indicated by IMS Voice over PS session supported indication as defined in TS 23.401 [28] and TS 23.502 [49]. For the purposes of this table, a UE in limited service state shall assume that Voice over IMS over PS sessions is supported when EMS=Y or ECL=Y.\nEMS\t=\tIMS Emergency Services supported as indicated by Emergency Service Support indicator as defined in TS 23.401 [28] and TS 23.501 [48] and TS 23.502 [49]. A UE in limited service state shall use the ims-EmergencySupport broadcast bit (TS 36.331 [55]; TS 38.331 [56]) instead of the Emergency Service Support indicator.\nECL\t=\teCall Over IMS support as indicated by the eCall support indicator defined in TS 23.401 [28] and TS 23.501 [48].\nNOTE 1:\tAs an implementation option, when the first attempt uses PS and fails for reasons other than related to IMS, the second attempt may use PS with a different 3GPP RAT. In this case the UE, can make a third attempt using CS.\nNOTE:\tIf the E-UTRAN and NG-RAN cells available to the UE have different settings, the UE assumes \"PS Available\" and \"ECL\" apply to whichever cell is indicated (as defined in TS 23.401 [28] and TS 23.501 [48]) as providing eCall over IMS support. When support by more than one cell is indicated, a UE may select any cell to attempt eCall over IMS according to the UE implementation.\nAnnex I (normative):IMS Emergency Services Using HRPD/EPC Network\nI.1\tcdma2000 HRPD/EPC Options\nThe following options from the normative clauses of this TS are applicable in cdma2000 HRPD systems with an EPC core network:\n1)\tClause 7.1.1, step 4 \"The IP‑CAN may support a UE indication that this request is for an emergency service\".\nThe following options from the normative clauses of this TS are not applicable in cdma2000 HRPD/EPC systems:\n1)\tClause 4.1 \"The P‑CSCF serving the emergency call is the IMS network entity which may retrieve the location identifier from the IP‑CAN\".\nI.2\tRequirements on the HRPD/EPC Network as an IP‑CAN\nFor an emergency call over HRPD/EPC, the requirements on the IP CAN are specified in 3GPP2 X.S0057-A [39].\nI.3\tInformation Flows\nThe informational flows for emergency calls over HRPD are provided in 3GPP2 X.S0057-A [39].\nAnnex J (normative):IMS emergency services using WLAN access to EPC\nJ.1\tGeneral\nThis annex includes additional clarifications when the IP-CAN corresponds to a WLAN access to EPC.\nBoth trusted WLAN access (S2a) and Untrusted WLAN access (S2b) to EPC for emergency sessions are supported.\nNOTE:\tThis annex only applies to EPC access using S2a or S2b.\nThe UE may issue an Emergency session over WLAN access to EPC only when 3GPP access for emergency call is not possible or available (e.g. no 3GPP coverage).\nFurther details on the procedures defined for WLAN access to EPC support of support emergency sessions are defined in TS 23.402 [29].\nJ.2\tUE specific behaviour\nProcedure for determining the list of emergency numbers:\n-\tIn addition to the emergency numbers and associated types stored either on the USIM or on the user equipment specified in clause 10.1.1 of TS 22.101 [8], the UE shall use the stored Local Emergency Numbers List received from the 3GPP network to detect that the number dialled is an emergency number.\n-\tIf a UE has a SIM/USIM and has received a list of emergency numbers, and associated types via mobility management procedures as described in TS 24.301 [33] or TS 24.008 [13] when connected to the PLMN using GERAN, UTRAN, E-UTRAN or TS 24.501 [52] when connected to NG-RAN or non-3GPP access connected to 5GC, or, for a UE supporting access to 5GC using non-3GPP access, as specified in Annex L, the UE shall use this list to determine if the dialled digits correspond to an emergency call as long as the UE has determined that the list is valid (see clause 4.1).\n-\tThe UE may also determine that the dialled digits and associated types or URN information correspond to an emergency call based on the list of emergency numbers retrieved by one of the following means:\nNOTE:\tHow the UE uses two lists (a list of emergency numbers and associated types or URN information received via mobility management procedures and a list of emergency numbers and associated types or URN information retrieved via the WLAN) is a stage 3 decision.\na)\tvia Access Network Query Protocol (ANQP) procedures defined in IEEE Std 802.11 2012 [47] from the associated WLAN AP upon completing authentication with the trusted WLAN access to EPC, with management frame protection enabled.\nb)\tvia a previous query to a DNS only when that DNS is in the same country as the UE and is an internal DNS server in the 3GPP network whose address is acquired from the ePDG; or\nc)\tvia IKEv2 procedures from ePDG.\n-\tThe list of downloaded emergency numbers shall be deleted at country change or, if the particular list is only valid for a PLMN, see clause 10.4.1 of TS 22.101 [8]), at successful registration with a different PLMN.\nFor the specific case where the UE has selected to make an emergency call over WLAN access to EPC (hence the UE has detected that the target URI or dialled digits correspond to an emergency sessions), the UE shall use the following procedures:\n-\tThe UE shall establish an emergency PDN connection over WLAN and shall perform an IMS emergency registration before sending an IMS emergency session request.\n-\tThe UE shall include any available location information in the IMS emergency session request. This is further detailed in TS 23.228 [1].\n-\tFor the media supported during IMS emergency sessions, media codec and format support is specified in TS 26.114 [34].\n-\tFor the support of DRVCC on emergency call on WLAN, see TS 23.237 [32].\nA UE shall not establish an emergency PDN connection over WLAN if the UE initiated a normal (i.e. non-emergency) session and is subsequently informed by the network that the ongoing session is accepted by the network even though it is an emergency session.\nJ.3\tHigh Level Procedures for IMS emergency calls\nFor the high level procedures (as described in clause 7.1.1) the following statements apply for UE detected emergency calls when EPC access over WLAN is used:\n-\tthe IP-CAN bearer resource is a PDN connection dedicated for emergency services. The TS 23.402 [29] describes how to indicate that a PDN connection request is for emergency;\n-\tFor registration requests received from an emergency PDN connection, the P-CSCF shall reject any IMS registration which is not for the emergency purpose.\nNOTE 1:\tWhen the IMS network detects that the UE is establishing an emergency session over WLAN access to EPC while the UE is not in its Home country, local policies in the Home IMS network may determine whether to nevertheless handle the emergency session\nFor the high level procedures (as described in clause 7.1.2) the following statements apply for Non UE detectable emergency calls when WLAN access to EPC is used:\n-\tThe P-CSCF may reject the session initiation request with an indication that this is an emergency session or may allow the session initiation request to continue.\nThe following flow contains a high level description of the emergency service procedures performed over WLAN access to EPC when the UE can detect that an emergency PDN connection is being needed. This flow provides details (or references) related with WLAN access to EPC on top of the general procedure described in clause 7.1.\nFigure J.3: Terminal Detected Emergency Calls (WLAN access to EPC)\nThe following steps are performed:\n1.\tSame as step 1 of Figure 7.1.\n2.\tThe UE releases any PDN connection it may have over untrusted access to EPC.\n3.\tVoid.\n4.\tAs described in TS 23.402 [29]:\n-\tin the case of untrusted access, the UE selects an ePDG for emergency services and sets-up a PDN connection for emergency services;\n-\tin the case of trusted access, the UE sets-up a PDN connection for emergency services.\nThe UE is assigned an IP address at this stage.\nNOTE 2:\tNo specific WLAN AP selection is carried out to support emergency services.\n5.\tSame as step 5 of Figure 7.1.\n6.\tSame as step 6 of Figure 7.1.\n7.\tSame as step 7 of Figure 7.1.\nJ.4\tLocation handling\nWhen a UE performs an emergency registration or initiates an emergency session over WLAN access to EPC the UE provides location information that is further defined in TS 23.228 [1].\nIf the operator policy requires network provided location using PCC-based solutions for the UE location, the P-CSCF may retrieve location information from the access network as defined in TS 23.203 [20] and includes it in the emergency session request, as described in TS 23.228 [1].\nAnnex K (normative):Support of IMS emergency sessions for roaming users in deployments without IMS-level roaming interfaces\nK.1\tGeneral\nThis annex includes network impact and call flows for support of IMS emergency sessions for roaming users in deployments without IMS-level roaming interface between the P-CSCF in the VPLMN and the S-CSCF in the HPLMNs. This annex also applies to IMS emergency sessions for SNPN users when there is no support for IMS-level roaming, or the user has no IMS credentials. This annex is only applicable to UTRAN, E-UTRAN and NG-RAN access networks.\nIMS authentication is performed by linking the IMS registration to user's EPS or 5GS authentication based on the user's IP address and IMSI. This mechanism is similar to GIBA (GPRS-IMS bundled authentication) specified in TS 33.203 [44]. The P-CSCF performs the GIBA procedure over Gm with the UE as defined in TS 24.229 [19]. If this procedure is not supported, UE may perform anonymous emergency session. A callback number for the user may also be retrieved via the PCRF or PCF.\nK.2\tFunctional description\nK.2.1\tGeneral\nThis clause lists the additional functionality in the network that is required to support IMS emergency sessions for roaming users in network deployments where there are no IMS-level roaming interfaces between the serving IMS network and the home IMS network.\nK.2.2\tP-CSCF\nIn addition to the functionality described in clause 6.2.1, the P-CSCF supports the functionality listed below:\n-\tP-CSCF shall be able to retrieve the UE/user's IMSI, IMEI and MSISDN (if available) from the PCRF/PCF.\n-\tP-CSCF may support the GIBA procedure over Gm as defined in TS 24.229 [19].\n-\tP-CSCF may verify the IMSI/IMEI provided in the SIP REGISTER message against the IMSI/IMEI provided by the PCRF or PCF.\nK.2.3\tPCRF or PCF\n-\tPCRF or PCF shall be able to provide the IMSI, the ME Identity (IMEISV), and MSISDN (if available) over Rx to the P-CSCF.\nK.2.4\tPGW or SMF/UPF\n-\tPGW or SMF/UPF shall be able to prevent \"source IP address spoofing\" for IMS emergency PDN connections if GIBA authentication, defined in TS 33.203 [44], is used as part of emergency IMS registration.\nK.2.4\tHSS or UDM\n-\tThe EPS user subscription at the HSS should contain exactly one MSISDN which should be the same as that in the IMS profile.\n-\tThe 5GS user subscription at the UDM should contain exactly one MSISDN based GPSI which should be the same as that in the IMS profile.\nK.3\tIMS Emergency Registration and Session Establishment\nThe call flow for support of IMS emergency sessions for roaming users in deployments without IMS-level roaming interfaces for UTRAN, E-UTRAN or NG-RAN access networks is described in Figure K.3-1.\nFigure K.3-1: IMS Emergency Session Establishment in deployments without IMS roaming interface between VPLMN and HPLMN\n1.\tUE establishes a PDN connection (for EPC) or PDU session (for 5GC) for IMS emergency services.\n2.\tFor EPC, IMSI and IMEI(SV) are retrieved from the UE. The MSISDN (if available) is provided by the HSS.\nFor 5GC, the SUPI and PEI are retrieved from the UE context stored in the AMF; the SUPI needs to contain an IMSI for PLMN accesses, and may contain an IMSI or a network-specific identifier (NSI) that takes the form of an NAI for SNPN access. TS 23.003 [21] specifies the IMPI and IMPI derivation for a NAI-based SUPI.\nThe PEI needs to contain an IMEI(SV). The GPSI (if available) is provided by the UDM; the GPSI needs to contain an MSISDN.\n3.\tFor EPC: MME/SGSN sends a Create Session Request towards the PGW including the IMSI, the IMEI(SV) and the MSISDN (if available) as specified in TS 23.401 [28].\nFor 5GS: AMF sends a Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContextRequest towards the SMF/UPF including the SUPI, the PEI and the GPSI (if available) as specified in TS 23.502 [49].\n4.\tFor EPC, PGW establishes an IP-CAN session with the PCRF as described in TS 23.401 [28] and TS 23.203 [20]. The IP-CAN session is identified with UE's IPv4 address of IPv6 prefix associated with the PDN connection for IMS emergency services. The IMSI, the IMEI(SV) and the MSISDN (if available) are passed to the PCRF as part of the IP-CAN session establishment.\nFor 5GC, SMF establishes an SM Policy Association with the PCF as described in TS 23.502 [49] and TS 23.503 [51]. The PDU session is identified with UE's IPv4 address or IPv6 prefix. The SUPI, PEI, GPSI (if available) and emergency DNN are passed to the PCF.\n5.\tThe Attach or UE requested PDN connection procedure (for EPC) or the PDU Session Establishment procedure (for 5GC) is being completed.\nSteps 6-12 apply if the UE performs IMS Emergency Registration, based on conditions specified in clause 4.1 e.g. UE is aware that it has sufficient IMS authentication material.\n6.\tUE initiates IMS emergency registration by sending a SIP REGISTER (UserID-1) message. The UserID-1 parameter is an IMPI and optionally an IMPU.\n7a.\tUpon reception of the SIP REGISTER message the P-CSCF determines that there is no IMS NNI to the user's HPLMN and the access type is not set to \"3GPP-NR-ProSe-L3UNR\" as described in Annex M. The P-CSCF requests the PCRF or PCF for EPS-level identities (e.g. IMSI, IMEI(SV), MSISDN) in the Rx session establishment request. For 5GC, P-CSCF may use the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization service as described in TS 23.502 [49] and TS 23.503 [51] instead of the Rx interface.\n7b.\tFor EPC, the PCRF performs session binding based on the UE's IP address/prefix (as defined in clause 6.1.1.2 of TS 23.203 [20]) and provides one or more EPS-level identities and the MSISDN (if available) to the P-CSCF.\nFor 5GC, the PCF performs session binding based on the UE's IP address/prefix (as defined in TS 23.503 [51]). If the Rx interface is used, the PCF extracts IMSI, IMEI(SV), and if available MSISDN from SUPI, PEI, and GPSI, respectively and provides the former identities to the P-CSCF. If the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization service is used, the PCF provides SUPI, PEI, and if available GPSI, and the P-CSCF extracts IMSI, IMEI(SV), and if available MSISDN from those identities.\nStep 7a and 7b can be skipped when the P-CSCF determines that there is no IMS NNI and the UE is a 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE based on the access type \"3GPP-NR-ProSe-L3UNR\" as described in clause Annex M.\n8.\tBased on operator configuration and if the network supports the GIBA procedure over Gm as defined in TS 24.229 [19], the P-CSCF responds with a 420 response with sec-agree value listed in the unsupported header field. Otherwise it rejects the IMS registration request with SIP 403 (Forbidden) as defined in TS 24.229 [19]. If the network supports anonymous IMS emergency sessions, P-CSCF may add an indication whether it supports anonymous IMS emergency sessions to the 403 or 420 response.\nSteps 9-12 apply if the P-CSCF has responded with a 420 response in step 8 and if the UE supports GIBA procedure as part of emergency IMS registration (irrespective of whether indication of anonymous IMS emergency session support was included in step 8).\n9.\tUE according to TS 24.229 [19], performs a new initial registration by sending a SIP REGISTER (UserID-2, IMEI) message and without inclusion of the Authorization header field. UserID-2 is a public user identity derived from SUPI (IMSI or NSI). P-CSCF may verify the IMSI/NSI/IMEI provided by the PCRF or PCF in step 7b against the IMSI/NSI/IMEI derived from the public user identity provided by the UE if step 7b is performed, prior to accepting the SIP REGISTER message.\n10.\tP-CSCF accepts the registration with 200 OK and provides a tel-URI based on the MSISDN (if available) received from PCRF in step 7b to the UE. From the UE point of view, the procedure is the same as specified for GIBA (GPRS-IMS bundled authentication) procedures in TS 24.229 [19].\n11.\tUE then attempts an IMS emergency session by sending a SIP INVITE (UserID-3) message. UserID-3 is set to UE's public identity (i.e. MSISDN as Tel-URI received in step 10).\n12.\tThe P-CSCF verifies whether the UserID-3 indicated in the SIP INVITE message complies with the tel-URI that was provided to the UE. If compliant, P-CSCF forwards the SIP INVITE towards the PSAP including a callback parameter (CallBackPar) in the form of TEL-URI derived from the MSISDN received in step 7 if step 7 is performed. The procedure stops here.\nSteps 13-15 apply if the UE attempts anonymous IMS emergency session, e.g. the P-CSCF has responded in step 8 with a 403 (Forbidden) response, or the P-CSCF has responded in step 8 with 420 response and the UE does not support GIBA as part of emergency IMS registration, or if the UE skipped IMS emergency registration:\n13.\tThe UE may attempt an unauthenticated IMS emergency session including an \"anonymous user\" parameter in the SIP INVITE message.\n14.\tUpon reception of the SIP INVITE and the access type is not set to \"3GPP-NR-ProSe-L3UNR\" as described in Annex M the P-CSCF either internally retrieves the one or more EPS-level identities and the MSISDN (if available) that were received in step 7b, or performs step 7 again.\n15.\tThe P-CSCF forwards the SIP INVITE (UserID-4, CallBackPar) towards the PSAP. UserID-4 is derived from one of the EPS-level identities received in step 7b. CallBackPar in the form of TEL-URI is derived from the MSISDN received in step 7b. The procedure stops here.\nStep 16 applies if the UE attempts an emergency call in the CS domain as specified in clause 4.1:\n16.\tSubsequent to the IMS registration failure in step 8 or subsequent to an anonymous SIP INVITE attempt the UE may attempt an emergency call in the CS domain.\nK.4\tNon UE detectable Emergency Session\nIn addition to clause 7.1.2, the following is applicable for this scenario:\n-\tIt is recommended that local emergency call numbers are provided to the UE according to the procedures specified in TS 24.501 [52], TS 24.301 [33], TS 24.008 [13] or Annex J.2. This helps to reduce the number of non-UE detected emergency numbers even for those PLMNs where only a subset of the local emergency numbers can be downloaded to the UEs.\n-\tWhen the UE registers in the IMS, the P-CSCF may retrieve the VPLMN-ID or SNPN ID of the UE as described in clause W.3 of TS 23.228 [1] and may access a database to obtain a list of all local emergency numbers for the visited PLMN, if not already available in the P-CSCF. These numbers are used for detection of non UE detectable emergency calls during IMS session setup. The database of PLMN-/SNPN- specific emergency numbers and its interface with the P-CSCF are not specified by 3GPP.\nAnnex L (normative):IMS emergency services using non-3GPP access to 5GC\nL.1\tGeneral\nThis annex includes additional clarifications when the IP-CAN corresponds to a non-3GPP access to 5GC.\nTrusted and untrusted non-3GPP access to 5GC for emergency sessions are supported.\nThe UE may issue an Emergency session over non-3GPP access to 5GC only when 3GPP access for emergency call is not possible or available (e.g. no 3GPP coverage).\nFurther details on the procedures defined for non-3GPP access to 5GC support of support emergency sessions are defined in TS 23.502 [49].\nL.2\tUE specific behaviour\nProcedure for determining the list of emergency numbers:\n-\tIn addition to the emergency numbers and associated types stored either on the USIM or on the user equipment specified in clause 10.1.1 of TS 22.101 [8], the UE shall use the stored Local Emergency Numbers List received from the 3GPP network to detect that the number dialled is an emergency number.\n-\tIf a UE has a SIM/USIM and has received a list of emergency numbers and associated types or URN information via mobility management procedures as described in TS 24.301 [33] and TS 24.008 [13] when connected to the PLMN using GERAN, UTRAN, E-UTRAN, or TS 24.501 [52] when connected to NG-RAN or non-3GPP access connected to 5GC, or, for a UE supporting access to EPC via WLAN, as specified in Annex J, the UE shall use this list to determine if the dialled digits correspond to an emergency call as long as the UE has determined that the list is valid (see clause 4.1).\nNOTE:\tHow the UE uses two lists (a list of emergency numbers and associated types or URN information received via mobility management procedures and , for a UE supporting access to EPC via WLAN, a list as specified in Annex J) is a stage 3 decision.\n-\tThe list of downloaded emergency numbers shall be deleted at country change or, if the particular list is only valid for a PLMN (see clause 10.4.1 of TS 22.101 [8]), at successful registration with a different PLMN.\nFor the specific case where the UE has selected to make an emergency call over non-3GPP access to 5GC (hence the UE has detected that the target URI or dialled digits correspond to an emergency sessions), the UE shall use the following procedures:\n-\tThe UE shall establish an emergency PDU session over non-3GPP and shall perform an IMS emergency registration before sending an IMS emergency session request.\n-\tThe UE shall include any available location information in the IMS emergency session request. This is further detailed in TS 23.228 [1].\n-\tFor the media supported during IMS emergency sessions, media codec and format support is specified in TS 26.114 [34].\nA UE shall not establish an emergency PDU session over non-3GPP access if the UE initiated a normal (i.e. non-emergency) session and is subsequently informed by the network that the ongoing session is accepted by the network even though it is an emergency session.\nL.3\tHigh Level Procedures for IMS emergency calls\nFor the high-level procedures (as described in clause 7.1.1) the following statements apply for UE detected emergency calls when 5GC access over non-3GPP access is used:\n-\tthe IP-CAN bearer resource is a PDU session dedicated for emergency services. TS 23.502 [49] describes how to indicate that a PDU Session Request is for emergency.\n-\tFor registration requests received from an emergency PDU session, the P-CSCF shall reject any IMS registration which is not for the emergency purpose.\nNOTE 1:\tWhen the IMS network detects that the UE is establishing an emergency session over non-3GPP access to 5GC while the UE is not in its Home country, local policies in the Home IMS network may determine whether to nevertheless handle the emergency session.\nFor the high-level procedures (as described in clause 7.1.2) the following statements apply for Non UE detectable emergency calls when non-3GPP access to 5GC is used:\n-\tThe P-CSCF may reject the session initiation request with an indication that this is an emergency session or may allow the session initiation request to continue.\nThe following flow contains a high-level description of the emergency service procedures performed over non-3GPP access to 5GC when the UE can detect that an emergency PDU session is being needed. This flow provides details (or references) related with non-3GPP access to 5GC on top of the general procedure described in clause 7.1.\nFigure L.3: Terminal Detected Emergency Calls (non-3GPP access to 5GC)\nThe following steps (numbering being the same as in figure 7.1) are performed:\n1.\tSame as step 1 of Figure 7.1.\n2.\tIn some exceptional cases (e.g. in congestion situation), the UE may release some PDU session it may have over non-3GPP access to 5GC.\n3.\tVoid (no \"bearer registration\" as described in step 3 of Figure 7.1).\n4.\tAs described in TS 23.502 [49]:\n-\tin the case of untrusted access, the UE selects an N3IWF as for accessing regular services and sets-up a PDU session for emergency services;\n-\tin the case of trusted access, the UE sets-up a PDU session for emergency services.\nThe UE is assigned an IP address at this stage.\nNOTE 2:\tWhen non-3GPP access is WLAN, no specific WLAN AP selection is carried out to support emergency services.\n5.\tSame as step 5 of Figure 7.1.\n6.\tSame as step 6 of Figure 7.1.\n7.\tSame as step 7 of Figure 7.1, except that eCall is not supported via untrusted non-3GPP access.\nL.4\tLocation handling\nWhen a UE performs an emergency registration or initiates an IMS emergency session over untrusted non-3GPP access to EPC the UE provides location information that is further defined in TS 23.228 [1].\nFor untrusted non-3GPP access to 5GC, provided location information can only correspond to the UE IP address seen by the N3IWF and used for traffic destined towards the UE.\nAnnex M (normative):IMS emergency service from 5G ProSe Remote UE via 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay\nM.1\tGeneral\nFor a 5G ProSe enabled UE as specified in TS 23.304 [53], if the UE does not have access to emergency service via any of the IP-CANs in table E.1, the UE (in the role of 5G ProSe Remote UE) may attempt to obtain emergency service via 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay if available.\nRefer to TS 23.304 [53] for further details how the 5G ProSe Remote UE initiates emergency service via the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay.\nM.2\tUE specific behaviour\nA 5G ProSe Remote UE identifies that the dialled digits correspond to an emergency call as specified in TS 22.101 [8].\nFor 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network relaying, the 5G ProSe Remote UE may obtain P-CSCF address from the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay via DHCP.\nNOTE 1:\tRemote UE obtaining P-CSCF address via DHCP is specified in clause 14A.2.1 of TS 24.379 [57].\nThe 5G ProSe Remote UE sets the access type \"3GPP-NR-ProSe-L2UNR\" or \"3GPP-NR-ProSe-L3UNR\" to P-CSCF for the access via 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay depending on whether Layer-2 or Layer-3 relaying is applied.\nNOTE 2:\tThe access types are specified in clause 7.2.15.3 of TS 24.229 [19].\nM.3\tLocation handling\nWhen a 5G ProSe Remote UE performs an emergency registration or initiates an emergency session over a 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay, if the operator policy requires network provided location using PCC-based solutions for the UE location, the P-CSCF may retrieve location information from the access network as defined in TS 23.503 [51] and include it in the emergency session request as described in TS 23.228 [1].\nNOTE:\tThe user location information contains the 5G ProSe Relay UE's location.\nWhen a 5G ProSe Remote UE establishes an emergency call over a 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay, the 5G ProSe Remote UE shall include in the IMS emergency request the NR Cell Global Identity (NCGI) obtained from the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay e.g., during the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay Discovery procedure specified in TS 23.304 [53]. When the P-CSCF determines that the emergency call is from a 5G ProSe Remote UE based on the access type \"3GPP-NR-ProSe-L3UNR\", the P-CSCF provides to the E-CSCF the NCGI and the UE Identity of 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay received from the PCF. The E-CSCF uses the NCGI and UE Identity of 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay to query the LRF to validate the NCGI provided by the 5G ProSe Remote UE as described in clause 4.3.1.\nNOTE 1:\tFor the location validation, it is only applied to IPv6 case as specified in TS 23.304 [53].\nNOTE 2:\tIf the Remote UE provides location information other than NCGI, then the validation for such information can be skipped.\nAnnex N (informative):Change history\nChange history\nDate\nMeeting\nTDoc\nCR\nRev\nCat\nSubject/Comment\nNew version\n2010-12\nSA#50\nSP-100694\n0182\n3\nB\nRetrieval of reference
