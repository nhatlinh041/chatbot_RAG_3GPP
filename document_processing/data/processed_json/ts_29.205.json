The following types of protocols are described: call control protocol, bearer control protocols and a  resource control protocol  for this architecture. The architecture complies with the requirements imposed by 3GPP TS 23.205 [1] and TS 23.153 [2].\nThe present document is valid for a 3rd generation PLMN (UMTS) complying with Release 4 and later.\nNote: Q.1902 can be used in other network architectures than the one defined in 3GPP TS 23.205 [1]",

An information element consists of four fields which always appear in the following order: Identifier (one octet), Length indicator, Compatibility information, Contents.\nThe Identifier distinguishes one type from another one and governs the interpretation of the contents. There are two types of Identifiers: type \"constructor\" and type \"simple\", for which the contents are defined as follows:\n-\tFor a \"constructor\" type, the Contents field shall again consist of one or more information elements, each of which is structured as described above, i.e., Identifier, Length indicator, Compatibility information, Contents.\n-\tFor a \"simple\" type, the Contents field contains one value only.\nWhen passing on an information element of type \"constructor\", the order of the information elements within this \"constructor\" shall be maintained.\nThe Length indicator specifies the length (i.e., integral number of octets in pure binary representation) of the Compatibility information and Contents. The length does not include the Identifier nor the Length indicator.\nThe format of the Length indicator is shown in Table B.2.1.1.2. Bit 8 is defined as Extension indicator and indicates whether or not the information on the length continues through the next octet. Value \"0\" of the Extension indicator means \"information continues through the next octet\", while value \"1\" means \"last octet\". The Length indicator itself has a maximum length of 2 octets, i.e., if octet 1a is needed, the Extension indicator of octet 1a is always set to value \"1\".\nTable B.2.1.1.2: Length indicator\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\nOctet\next.\nLSB\n1\next. 1\n0\n0\n0\nMSB\n1a\nThe Compatibility information contains corresponding instructions for the case that the received information element is unrecognised.

A SN involved in a LCLS Configuration Change procedure must not initiate a new LCLS Configuration Change Request until the existing LCLS Configuration Change procedure has been completed.\nA LCLS Configuration Change Request message may be sent in either direction and at any time during the active phase of a call, after the LCLS negotiation has been performed during the call establishment. A LCLS Configuration Change Request and a LCLS Configuration Preference Information Elements indicating the requested change of the LCLS configuration shall be included in a MST_data primitive, corresponding to an APM message.\nA MST_Data primitive, corresponding to the APM message shall be issued in response, including the LCLS Configuration Preference and the LCLS Configuration Change Result Information Elements indicating if the requested change of LCLS configuration has been accepted and if it has not been accepted the reason for rejection.\nThe compatibility information of the LCLS Configuration Preference, the LCLS Configuration Change Request and LCLS Configuration Change Result Information Elements shall be set so as to cause the Information Element to be discarded and send notification by nodes that do not support LCLS service.\nNOTE:\tThe term \"initiating\" SN in the following clauses refers to a SN which initiates the LCLS Configuration Change Request. The term \"terminating\" SN in the following clauses refers to a SN which terminates the LCLS Configuration Change Request.\nC.2.4.2\tActions at Initiating Serving Node\nIf a SN determines that LCLS configuration needs to be changed it may send an APM message which includes a LCLS Configuration Change Request and the LCLS Configuration Preference Information Elements to its succeeding and/or preceding node. The initiating SN shall set the desired configurations as described in sub-clause C.2.1.2.\nThe LCLS Configuration Change Request may only be initiated if LCLS Negotiation was performed during call establishment.\nNOTE:\tthis does not require that LCLS was permitted during the call establishment.\nOn receipt of an APM message containing the LCLS Configuration Preference and the LCLS Configuration Change Result Information Elements, if the result indicates \"accepted\" the modification of the LCLS Configuration settings has been successful. If the LCLS Configuration Change Result Information Element indicates \"rejected\" the initiating SN shall resume the LCLS connection with the LCLS configuration unchanged.\nC.2.4.3\tActions at Intermediate Serving Node\nWhen an intermediate SN receives an APM message with the LCLS Configuration Change Request and the LCLS Configuration Preference Information Elements requesting a certain LCLS Configuration Change the intermediate SN shall check if it can support the requested LCLS configuration. If the intermediate SN can support the proposed LCLS configuration it shall forward the LCLS Configuration Preference and the LCLS Configuration Change Request Information Elements to its succeeding or preceding node. If the intermediate SN cannot support/permit the proposed LCLS configuration it shall respond with a LCLS Configuration Change Result Information Element set to \"LCLS Configuration Change request rejected\" along with the Rejection Indicator detailing the reason for rejection.\nOn receipt of an APM message with the LCLS Configuration Change Result and LCLS Configuration Preference Information Elements from its succeeding/preceding node if the LCLS Configuration Change Result Information Elements indicates \"accepted\" the intermediate SN shall store the LCLS configuration settings from the LCLS Configuration Preference Information Element and shall forward the APM message to its preceding/succeeding node.\nIf the LCLS Configuration Change Result Information Element indicates \"rejected\" the intermediate SN shall resume the LCLS connection with the LCLS configuration unchanged and the intermediate SN shall forward the APM message to its preceding/succeeding node.\nC.2.4.4\tActions at Terminating Serving Node\nWhen an SN which is a terminating SN with respect to a LCLS Configuration Change Request receives an APM message with the LCLS Configuration Change Request and LCLS Configuration Preference Information Elements requesting a certain LCLS Configuration Change the terminating SN shall check if it can support the requested LCLS configuration.\nIf the terminating SN can support the proposed LCLS configuration change it shall return the LCLS Configuration Preference Information Element and the LCLS Configuration Change Result Information Element indicating acceptance of the LCLS Configuration Change to its succeeding or preceding node.

A LCLS Status Identifier Information Element indicating the new LCLS connection status value shall be included in a MST_data primitive, corresponding to an APM message.\nThe compatibility information of the LCLS Status Identifier shall be set so as to cause the Information Element to be discarded and send notification by nodes that do not support LCLS service.\nNOTE:\tThe term \"initiating\" SN in the following clauses refers to an originating SN or a destination SN that may initiate the LCLS Status Update message.
