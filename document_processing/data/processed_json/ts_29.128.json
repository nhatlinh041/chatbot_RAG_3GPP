For example, the SCEF may take into account the traffic over the T6a/b interfaces or other interfaces, the level of usage of internal resources (CPU, memory), the access to external resources etc.\nThe SCEF determines the specific contents of the OC-OLR AVP in overload reports and the SCEF decides when to send OC-OLR AVPs by implementation specific means.\nThe SCEF may decide to deactivate Monitoring events to reduce the number of Reporting-Information-Requests sent for reporting monitoring events.\nThe SCEF shall apply required traffic reduction according to the OC-OLR AVPs received in answer commands from the MME to subsequent applicable requests, as per IETF RFC 7683 [9].\nRequested traffic reduction is achieved by the SCEF by implementation specific means.

For example, it may implement throttling of monitoring event report with prioritization, throttling of MO data or MT data messages.\nAnnex B (normative):Diameter message priority mechanism\nB.1\tGeneral\nIETF RFC 7944 [15] specifies a Diameter routing message priority mechanism that allows Diameter nodes to indicate the relative priority of Diameter messages. With this information, other Diameter nodes may leverage the relative priority of Diameter messages into routing, resource allocation, set the DSCP marking for transport of the associated Diameter message, and also abatement decisions when overload control is applied.\nB.2\tT6a, T6ai, T6b, T6bi, T7 interfaces\nThe Diameter message priority mechanism is an optional feature which may apply on one or several of the T6a, T6ai, T6b, T6bi, T7 interfaces.\nIt is recommended to make use of IETF RFC 7944 [15] over the T6a, T6ai, T6b, T6bi, T7 interfaces of an operator network when the overload control defined in Annex A is applied on these interfaces.\nA 3GPP functional entity supporting the Diameter message priority mechanism over one or several of the T6a, T6ai, T6b, T6bi, T7 interfaces shall comply with IETF RFC 7944 [15].\nA 3GPP functional entity sending a request shall determine the required priority according to its policies. When priority is required, it shall include the DRMP AVP indicating the required priority level in the request it sends, and shall prioritise the request according to the required priority level.\nWhen the 3GPP functional element receives the corresponding response, it shall prioritise the received response according to the priority level received within the DRMP AVP if present in the response, otherwise according to the priority level of the corresponding request.\nWhen a 3GPP functional entity receives a request, it shall handle the request according to the received DRMP AVP priority level. For the response, it may modify the priority level received in the DRMP AVP according to its policies and shall handle the response according to the required priority level. If the required priority level is different from the priority level received in the request, it shall include the DRMP AVP in the response.\nIf:\n-\ta 3GPP functional entity supports using the Diameter message priority mechanism for DSCP marking purposes,\n-\tthe transport network utilizes DSCP marking, and\n-\tmessage-dependant DSCP marking is possible for the protocol stack transporting Diameter,\nthen the 3GPP functional entity shall set the DSCP marking for transport of the request or response according to the required priority level.\nThe decisions of the 3GPP functional entity for a required priority and for the priority level value are implementation specific.\nDiameter requests related to high priority traffic shall contain a DRMP AVP with a high priority of which the level value is operator dependent.\nAnnex C (normative):Diameter load control mechanism\nC.1\tGeneral\nThe Diameter load control mechanism is an optional feature over the T6a/b and T7 interface, which may be applied to the traffic of request commands sent to the SCEF and/or to the traffic of request commands sent to the MME/SGSN.\nIt is recommended to make use of the IETF RFC 8583 [31] on the T6a/b and T7 interface where:\n-\twhen applied to the traffic of request commands sent to the SCEF, the MME/SGSN, and as an alternative  the IWK-SCEF shall behave as a reacting node;\n-\twhen applied to the traffic of request commands sent to the MME/SGSN, the SCEF, and as an alternative the IWK-SCEF, shall behave as a reacting node.\nC.2\tSCEF behaviour\nWhen performing next hop Diameter Agent selection for requests that are routed based on realm, the SCEF may take into account load values from Load AVPs of type PEER received from candidate next hop Diameter nodes, as per IETF RFC 8583 [31].\nC.3\tMME/SGSN behaviour\nWhen performing next hop Diameter Agent selection for requests that are routed based on realm, the MME/SGSN may take into account load values from Load AVPs of type PEER received from candidate next hop Diameter nodes, as per IETF RFC 8583 [31].\nC.4\tIWK-SCEF behaviour\nWhen performing next hop Diameter Agent selection for requests that are routed based on realm, the IWK-SCEF may take into account load values from Load AVPs of type PEER received from candidate next hop Diameter nodes, as per IETF RFC 8583 [31].\nAnnex D (informative):Change
