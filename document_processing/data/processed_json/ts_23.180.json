      "content": "Figure 10.7.3-1 describes the IOPS MC notification procedure when an MC service user has left an active IOPS MC system and enters the primary MC system.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tThere is an active IOPS MC connectivity function and the neighbouring cells of the IOPS MC system are part of the primary MC system.\n-\tThe MC service user 1 is initially registered to the IOPS MC connectivity function for the support of MC services in the IOPS mode of operation. The MC service user 1 is authorized to provide MC IOPS notifications to the primary MC service server.\n-\tThe MC service user 2 is registered to the primary MC service server and is in the proximity of the IOPS MC system coverage.\n-\tMC server users 1 and 2 are members of the same MC service group or are authorized to have a one-to-one MC service communication.\nFigure 10.7.3-1: MC IOPS notification procedure\n1.\tAn IOPS mode of operation is active and the MC service communication is handled by the IOPS MC connectivity function. The MC service client 1 is registered to the IOPS MC connectivity function.\n2.\tThe MC service client 1 moves out of the coverage of the IOPS MC system and registers to the primary MC service server.\n3.\tThe MC service client 1 sends a MC IOPS notification to the primary MC service server to provide information about an active IOPS MC connectivity function in the area. This notification includes information about the active IOPS MC connectivity function such as server URI, associated IOPS PLMN ID, and location information. Also, the MC service client 1 may indicate which MC service groups and MC service users were identified as active and available on the IOPS MC connectivity function.\n4.\tThe primary MC service server becomes aware of the active IOPS MC connectivity function and can use the received information to determine that affiliated MC service users might be registered on the active IOPS MC connectivity function and might not be reachable on the system. If the primary MC service server determines that the IOPS MC connectivity function is active and identifies that affiliated MC service users are in the proximity of the IOPS MC system, the primary MC service server may notify the corresponding MC service users about the IOPS MC connectivity function.\nNOTE 1:\tThe primary MC service server can use received information from different MC IOPS notifications (e.g. location information including the time of measurement) and the information obtained from location information subscriptions (as described in 3GPP TS 23.280 [3]) to determine if the IOPS MC connectivity function might be still active. For instance, if information received from location information subscriptions indicates that MC service users are located within the notified active IOPS MC system coverage, the primary MC service server can determine that the IOPS MC connectivity function is no longer active.\n5.\tIf the primary MC service server determines that the IOPS MC connectivity function is active, it sends a MC IOPS notification to the MC service client 2 in proximity of the active IOPS MC system coverage. This information can be used by the MC service user to become aware of the active IOPS MC connectivity function. Hence, the MC service user might decide to not move into the IOPS MC system coverage or to improve the switching time between the systems. Also, the MC service user can be aware of the potential availability of MC service users or active MC service groups on the IOPS MC connectivity function.\nNOTE 2:\tThe MC IOPS notification can be sent on an MBMS bearer configured within the proximity of the active IOPS MC system to target multiple MC service users. In this case, information about the active MC service IDs and MC service group IDs is not included in the MC IOPS notification.\nAnnex A (normative):Configuration data for the support of MC services in the IOPS mode of operation\nA.1\tGeneral\nThis Annex provides information about the static configuration data needed for the support of MC services in the IOPS mode of operation.\nThe configuration data belong to one of the following categories:\n-\tMC service UE configuration data (see subclause A.2);\n-\tMC service user profile configuration data (see subclause A.3);\n-\tMC service group configuration data (see subclause A.4); and\n-\tMC service configuration data (see subclause A.5).\nThe configuration data in each configuration category corresponds to a single instance of the category type i.e. the MC service UE, MC service group, MC service user and MC service configuration data refers to the information that will be stored against each MC service UE, MC service group, MC service user and MC service.\nNOTE:\tThe configuration data described in this Annex together with corresponding configuration data provided in 3GPP TS 23.280 [3], 3GPP TS 23.379 [5] and 3GPP TS 23.282 [6] represent the complete set of data for each configuration data category element.\nThe columns in the tables have the following meanings:\n-\tReference: the reference of the corresponding requirement in 3GPP TS 22.346 [9] and 3GPP TS 22.280 [11] or the corresponding clause from either the present document or the referenced document.\n-\tParameter description: A short definition of the semantics of the corresponding item of data, including denotation of the level of the parameter in the configuration hierarchy.\n-\tWhen it is not clear to which functional entities the parameter is configured, then one or more columns indicating this are provided where the following nomenclature is used:\n-\t\"Y\" to denote \"Yes\" i.e. the parameter denoted for the row needs to be configured to the functional entity denoted for the column.\n-\t\"N\" to denote \"No\" i.e. the parameter denoted for the row does not need to be configured to the functional entity denoted for the column.\nParameters within a set of configuration data have a level within a hierarchy that pertains only to that configuration data. The level of a parameter within the hierarchy of the configuration data is denoted by use of the character \">\" in the parameter description field within each table, one per level. Parameters that are at the top‑most level within the hierarchy have no \">\" character. Parameters that have one or more \">\" characters are child parameters of the first parameter above them that has one less \">\" character. Parent parameters are parameters that have one or more child parameters. Parent parameters act solely as a \"grouping\" of their child parameters and therefore do not contain an actual value themselves i.e. they are just containers for their child parameters.\nEach parameter that can be configured online shall only be configured through one online reference point. Each parameter that can be configured offline shall only be configured through one offline reference point. The most recent configuration data made available to the MC service UE shall always overwrite previous configuration data, irrespective of whether the configuration data was provided via the online or offline mechanism.\nA.2\tMC service UE configuration data\nMC service UE configuration data has to be known by an MC service UE after MC service authorization. The CSC-4 reference point, specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [3], is used for configuration between the configuration management server and the configuration management client on the MC service UE when the MC service UE is on-network.\nMC service UE configuration data can be configured offline using the CSC-11 reference point specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [3].\nWithin each MC service, the MC service UE configuration data can be the same or different across MC service UEs.\nThe MCPTT UE configuration data specified in table A.2-1 in 3GPP TS 23.379 [5] is also used, as needed, in the IOPS mode of operation for the MCPTT service.\nThe MCData UE configuration data specified in table A.2-1 in 3GPP TS 23.282 [6] is also used, as needed, in the IOPS mode of operation for the MCData service.\nA.3\tMC service user profile configuration data\nThe MC service user profile configuration data is stored in the MC service user database. The configuration management server is used to configure the MC service user profile configuration data to the MC service user database (CSC-13) and MC service UE (CSC-4), as specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [3].\nMC service user profile configuration data can be configured offline using the CSC-11 reference point specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [3].\nFor the MCPTT service, the MCPTT user profile configuration data specified in table A.3-1 in 3GPP TS 23.379 [5] is also used, as needed, in the IOPS mode of operation, wherein the IOPS MCPTT user identity (IOPS MCPTT ID) can be the MCPTT user identity (MCPTT ID) or a specific ID configured for the IOPS mode of operation.\nFor the MCData service, the MCData user profile configuration data specified in table A.3-1 in 3GPP TS 23.282 [6] is also used, as needed, in the IOPS mode of operation, wherein the IOPS MCData user identity (IOPS MCData ID) can be the MCData user identity (MCData ID) or a specific ID configured for the IOPS mode of operation.\nTable A.3-1 described below contains additional MC service user profile configuration required to support MC services in the IOPS mode of operation.\nTable A.3-1: MC service user profile data (IOPS)\nReference\nParameter description\nMC service UE\nConfiguration management server\nMC service user database\n[R-10-001] of 3GPP TS 22.280 [11]\nList of IOPS MC service groups for use by an MC service user\nY\nY\nY\n> IOPS MC service Group ID\n> Application plane server identity information of group management server where group is defined\n>> Server URI\nY\nY\nY\n> Application plane server identity information of identity management server which provides authorization for group (see NOTE 1)\n>> Server URI\nY\nY\nY\n[R-10-001] of 3GPP TS 22.280 [11]\nAuthorization for participant to change an IOPS group call in-progress to IOPS emergency group call (see NOTE 2)\nY\nY\nY\n[R-10-001] of 3GPP TS 22.280 [11]\nAuthorization for MC services in the IOPS mode of operation\nY\nY\nY\nClause 10.2.2.3\nAuthorization for participant to indicate availability of connectivity information\nY\nY\nY\nClause 10.2.2.3\nAuthorization for participant to request priority state\nY\nY\nY\nNOTE 1:\tIf this parameter is not configured, authorization to use the group shall be obtained from the identity management server identified in the initial MC service UE configuration data configured in 3GPP TS 23.280 [3].\nNOTE 2:\tThis parameter only applies for the MCPTT service.\nA.4\tGroup configuration data\nAs specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [3], the group configuration data is stored in the group management server. The group management server is used to configure the group configuration data to the MC service UE (CSC-2). The group configuration data can be configured offline using the CSC-12 reference point.\nThe common group configuration data specified in table A.4-1 in 3GPP TS 23.280 [3] is also used, as needed, in the IOPS mode of operation.\nTable A.4-1 described below contains additional group configuration data required to support MC services in the IOPS mode of operation.\nTable A.4-1: Group configuration data (IOPS)\nReference\nParameter description\nMC service UE\nGroup management server\n[R-10-001] of 3GPP TS 22.280 [11]\nList of IOPS MC service groups\nY\nY\n> IOPS MCPTT Group ID\nClause 8.1.3\n>> IOPS group IP multicast address\nY\nY\n>> Preferred voice codecs for IOPS MCPTT group\nY\nY\n>> Indication whether emergency group call is permitted on the IOPS MCPTT group\nY\nY\n> IOPS MCData Group ID\nClause 8.1.3\n>> IOPS group IP multicast address\nY\nY\n>> MCData sub-services and features enabled for the group\n>>> Short data service enabled\nY\nY\n>>> Whether MCData user is permitted to transmit data in the group\nY\nY\n>>> Maximum amount of data that the MCData user can transmit in a single request during group communication\nY\nY\n>>> Maximum amount of time that the MCData user can transmit in a single request during group communication\nY\nY\nA.5\tMC service configuration data\nAs specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [3], the configuration management server is used to configure the MC service configuration data to the MC service UE (CSC-4).
