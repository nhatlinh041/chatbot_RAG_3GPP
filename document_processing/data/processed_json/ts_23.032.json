The ellipsoid is constructed by the rotation of an ellipse around the minor axis which is oriented in the North-South direction. The rotation axis is the polar axis of the ellipsoid and the plane orthogonal to it and including the centre of symmetry is the equatorial plane.\nThe relevant dimensions are as follows:\nMajor Axis (a) = 6378137 m\nMinor Axis (b) = 6356752,314 m\nFirst eccentricity of the ellipsoid\nCo-ordinates are then expressed in terms of longitude and latitude relevant to this ellipsoid.

Altitudes are defined as the distance between the ellipsoid and the point, along a line orthogonal to the ellipsoid.\nLocal Co-ordinates are relative to a known reference point defined by an unique Coordinate ID configured by the PLMN operator.
