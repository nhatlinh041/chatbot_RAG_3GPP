Two kinds of request may be received in an FFN which deals with forwarding services:\n-\tCFU requests sent by the VLR for CFU operations (only if the FFN is a HLR);\n-\tFM-HLR-Requests which are USSD strings sent by HLRa for FM operations.\nWhen the control process in the FFN receives a CFU request, it shall either pass the CFU operation request directly to a CFU process or reject it depending on the registration and/or activation states of both FM and CFU services (see Table A.1 for permission checks).\nOn receipt of an HLR-FM request, the control process in the FFN performs a series of FM specific checks and checks the states of both FM and CFU. If the checks are successful, a CFU operation request is sent to a CFU process. On receipt of an HLR-FM-Request from HLRa, the FFN performs a series of checks. e.g.:\n-\tif the remote party is a GSM subscriber:\n-\tprovisioning of FM to the remote party;\n-\tprovisioning of CFU to the remote party;\n-\tillegal interaction with CFU registered or active to remote party.\n-\tif the remote number is registered in the FFN;\n-\tif any operator specific restrictions to engage in FM activity with the initiating subscriber apply;\n-\tspecific checks for forced erasure.\nDepending on the requested operation, one of the following procedures is performed:\n-\tregistration with implicit Activation (procedure Handle_Remote_Party_Registration, figure 4.6);\n-\terasure with implicit Deactivation (procedure Handle_Remote_Party_Erasure, figure 4.7);\n-\tinterrogation (procedure Handle_Remote_Party_Interrogation, figure 4.8).\nFor successful forced erasure by a service supervisor, the FFN shall generate an USSD-Notify message and send it to the HLRp, which will relay the USSD Notify towards the MS of the previously registered subscriber (MSp). On receipt of an error response that the USSD Notify message could not be transferred to the MS, the FFN shall check the error code of the response.

The principles of USSD can be found in 3GPP TS 22.090, 3GPP TS 23.090, 3GPP TS 24.090 and 3GPP TS 29.002.\nThe present document is only concerned with the contents of the USSD strings.\nB.2\tInformation Elements used in the messages\nThe operation code\nThe operation code is defined in 3GPP TS 22.030 for the control of Supplementary Services and consists of the two characters:\n-\t**\tfor Registration;\n-\t##\tfor Erasure;\n-\t*#\tfor Interrogation.\nThe Service Codes\nThe Service Code is service specific for FM.\nThe remote number\nThe remote number is the basic MSISDN of the remote party if the remote party is a GSM subscriber. It is entered by the initiating subscriber as part of the registration request. It is a number in international format.\nAdditional information field\nAn additional information field which does not exceed 30 octets may be optionally included in all FM control messages to convey operator specific information to the FFNb. The content and use of this additional information is operator specific and out of scope of the present document.\nThe initiating number\nThe initiating number is the basic MSISDN of the initiating subscriber. It is derived by HLRa from the IMSI of the initiating subscriber.\nThis parameter is used in international format according to the scheme:\n-\tcountry code, national (significant) number.\nB.3\tMessages Contents of the FM Request\nContents of the USSD string of FM-Request:\n-\tall parameters are entered by the initiating subscriber and transported transparently to HLRa.\nTable B.1: Contents of the USSD string of FM-Request\nParameter number\nValue\nParametermandatory  (M)or optional  (O)\nComment\n1\nOC\nM\nOperation Code:\nOC = ** ... for Registration\nOC = ## ... for Erasure\nOC = *# ... for Interrogation\n2\nSC\nM\nService Code for Follow Me.

Additionally, the MSISDNa is sent to the FFNb together with the FM-Request within the MAP operation. Contents of the FM-Response Messages.\nThe FM-Response messages which are generated by the HLR, as well as the HLR-FM-Response messages which are received by the HLR from the FFN and are forwarded unchanged as FM-Response messages to the MS, contain the following two parts:\n-\tmandatory part: two digit outcome codes, which are interpreted in the MS according to operator specific requirements;\n-\toptional part: the response texts.\nThe optional part is separated by a space character as separator which occurs together with the optional part.\nThese outcome codes indicating success or error of the requested FM operation are 2 USSD characters according to the following table (table B.2).\nTable B.2 Outcome codes for FM-Response\nScenario\nText examples for MS display\nReg\nEra\nInterro\nOutcome Code\nOutcome codes for successful cases\n00 series\nSuccess registration Case\nFollow Me activated\nX\n01\nSuccess erasure Case\nFollow Me deactivated\nX\n02\nSuccess interrogation Case\nFollow Me active to<MSISDN>\nThe MSISDN digits are sent in the USSD response separated by a blank character from the outcome code.\nX\n03\nOperator Specific outcome codes\n04-06\nReserved for future enhancement\n07-09\nSpare outcome code\n10\nReserved for GSM-Railway\n11-12\nSpare outcome codes\n13-19\nOutcome codes generated at the HLRa in non-successful cases\n20, 30 series\nIncoming barrings\nIllegal interaction with incoming barring\nX\nX\nX\n21\nUnauthorised request\nUnauthorised request\nX\nX\nX\n22\nOperator Specific outcome codes\n23-30\nReserved for future enhancement\n31-39\nOutcome codes generated at both the HLRa and the FM function node in non-successful cases\n40 series\nUnknown remote party\nUnknown remote party\nX\nX\nX\n41\nFM not subscribed\nFM not subscribed\nX\nX\nX\n42\nOperator Specific outcome codes\n43-45\nReserved for future enhancement\n46-49\nSpare unsuccessful outcome codes\n50 series\nOutcome codes generated at the FM function node in non-successful cases\n60, 70 series\nRemote party already registered\nRemote party already registered\nX\n61\nFM not registered to remote party\nFM not registered to remote party\nX\nX\n62\nRemote party not registered to this MSISDN\nRemote party not registered to this MSISDN\nX\n63\nRemote Party Authorisation failed\nUnauthorised changes to remote party\nX\nX\n64\nCall Forwarding active or registered\nIllegal interaction with call forwarding\nX\n65\nIncoming or outgoing barrings\nIllegal interaction with call barrings\nX\nX\n66\nRequest to own MSISDN not possible\nRequest to own MSISDN not possible\nX\n67\nOperator Specific outcome codes\n68-72\nReserved for future enhancement\n73-79\nOutcome codes could be sent back by CFU processes in unsuccessful cases\nforwarded-to number is invalid directory number\nforwarded-to number is invalid directory number\nX\n80\ninsufficient information\ninsufficient information\nX\nX\n81\nforwarded-to number is a special service code\nforwarded-to number is a special service code (e.g. police)\nX\n82\nConflicting situation with other supplementary services\nConflicting situation with other supplementary services (e.g. incoming call barring has been activated)\nX\nX\n83\nInconsistent with registration\nInconsistent with registration\nX\n84\nSpare unsuccessful outcome codes\n85 - 99\nB.5\tContents and Format of the USSD String of the USSD-Notify\nThe Contents and the format of the USSD string of the USSD-Notify are described in the following table.\nTable B.3: Contents of the USSD string of the USSD-Notify for forced de-registration\nParameter number\nValue\nParametermandatory  (M),optional  (O) or conditional (C)\nComment\n1\nOC\nM\nOperation Code:\nOC = ## ... for Erasure\n2\nSC\nM\nService Code for Follow Me.

It is sent from the process Handle_Remote_Party_Erasure to process FFN_Forced_Erasure_Notify.\nThis message consists of the parameter USSD String. On receipt of the Init-Notify message, the process FFN_Forced_Erasure_Notify will pack the USSD String into the USSD-Notify message and send it to the HLRp. Refer to Table B.3 for the contents and format of the USSD String.\nThis message is only required where the FFN is based on an HLR.
