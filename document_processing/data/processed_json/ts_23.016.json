In this specification those data sent to the VLR are called non-GPRS subscriber data and those data sent to the SGSN are called GPRS subscriber data.\nWhenever the refining identifier non-GPRS or GPRS is missing a common rule is addressed which hold for both kinds of subscriber data.\nSubscriber data specific to non-GPRS shall only be sent from the HLR to the VLR.

Semantically optional parameters are always defined as syntactically optional by the protocol.\nMissing data: Data which is mandatory in a given context but is not received nor is valid data available locally.\nUnexpected data: Data which is received and cannot be further processed.
