      "content": "The SCC AS is a home network based IMS Application that provides functionality required to enable IMS Centralized Services. The SCC AS is inserted in the session path using originating and terminating iFCs; it is configured as the first AS in the originating iFC and as the last AS in the terminating iFC chain. The SCC AS may also be invoked through the use of PSI termination procedures when using CS access.\nThe SCC AS implements one or more of the following functionalities:\n-\tICS User Agent (IUA): The ICS User Agent (IUA) function provides SIP UA behaviour on behalf of the UE for setup and control of IMS sessions using CS bearers that are established with or without the use of Gm or I1 between the UE and the SCC AS. For sessions established using Gm or I1 between the ICS UE and the SCC AS the IUA combines the service control signalling with the description of the bearer, e.g. SDP, established via the CS access to present a standard IMS session on behalf of the UE. An SCC AS may support I1 reference point. If supporting the I1 reference point, and before initiating an I1 Service Control Signalling Path flow, the SCC AS shall ensure that the ICS UE supports I1 and the PLMN the UE is in supports transport of network initiated I1 signalling.\n-\tCS Access Adaptation (CAA): The CS Access Adaptation (CAA) is an adaptation function for the service control signalling communicated transparently via the CS domain between the UE and the SCC AS. The CAA processes the service control signalling received via the CS access for interworking with other IMS functional elements. The CAA is only used when using the CS network for communication of service control signalling.\n-\tTerminating Access Domain Selection (T-ADS): Terminating Access Domain Selection (T-ADS) provides:\n-\tDirects an incoming session to an ICS User;\n-\tFor one or more UEs of an ICS User:\n-\tInfluences the selection of one or more contacts amongst the registered contacts and;\n-\tInfluences the selection of an access network for delivery of the incoming session to the selected contact, or;\n-\tPerforms breakout to the CS Domain by fetching the CSRN.\nT-ADS shall take into account the access network's capabilities, UE capabilities, IMS registration status, CS status, existing active sessions, user preferences, UE 3GPP PS Data Off status (active/inactive), 3GPP PS Data Off Exempted Service configuration setting, operator policies such as access network specific voice domain preferences and the media component types, and whether there is an ongoing IMS voice over PS session. In addition, T-ADS may take into account the access network information provided directly by the UE.\nThe UE may assist the T-ADS. The UE assisted T-ADS (UE T-ADS), based on configuration that takes into account operator policy, user preferences and local access network capabilities, performs the following:\n-\tDetect media that is candidate for delivery over the CS domain associated with an incoming session.\n-\tIdentify the domain in which the session is to be established (CS or PS).\n-\tDetermines the mechanism to complete the establishment (origination or termination) - applicable to sessions to be established in the CS domain only.\n-\tNotifies the SCC AS of the mechanism the establishment will be completed on - if possible.\nFor delivery of an incoming session to non ICS UE, the SCC AS may deliver the session in other domain if call delivery in the originally selected domain fails, e.g. delivers the call in CS domain when session establishment in the PS domain does not succeed.\nFor delivery of an incoming session to an ICS User, the T-ADS shall perform the following:\n1.\tAssists in delivery of an incoming session, whether to:\n-\tDeliver all media via PS.\n-\tDeliver speech media via CS and use Gm for service control.\n-\tDeliver speech media via CS and use I1 for service control.\n-\tDeliver speech media via MSC Server enhanced for ICS.\n-\tDeliver speech media via MSC Server not enhanced for ICS.\n2.\tIt assists in selection of an access network for delivery of the incoming session to the ICS User contact address(es). Selection criteria as specified in TS 23.221 [10] clause 7.2b, Access Domain Selection for terminating sessions are used for access network selection.\nFor incoming sessions with bi-directional speech media destined to a selected contact:\n-\tFor 3GPP access, the SCC AS shall retrieve from the serving PLMN via the HSS (+UDM in case of 5GC as specified in TS 23.501 [55]) the most recent access network capabilities (\"IMS voice over PS Session Supported Indication\", current RAT type) unless there is, for the same UE, an existing IMS voice over PS session or an existing speech session using the CS bearer that is not using the Gm service control signalling path.\n-\tFor networks which support WLAN access, and if WLAN access is allowed to support IMS voice based on operator policy, the SCC AS shall additionally take the time of the most recent IMS 3rd party registration or re-registration via WLAN access into account.\nIf the most recent access network capabilities can be retrieved, then:\n-\tIf the most recently used PS access network (including WLAN access) indicates that IMS voice over PS is supported then bi-directional speech media can be delivered on this access.\n-\tIf the most recently used PS access network indicates that IMS voice over PS is not supported, then bi-directional speech media shall not be delivered on this access.\n-\tIf the current RAT type indicates that simultaneous transfer on PS and CS domains is supported, then speech media can be delivered via CS and Gm can be used for service control.\n-\tIf the current RAT type indicates that simultaneous transfer on PS and CS domains is not supported, then Gm shall not be used for service control.\nIf there is an existing speech session using the CS bearer that is not using the Gm service control signalling path then Gm shall not be used for service control.\n3.\tFor delivery of incoming sessions to the UE registered in CS domain via standard MSC Server, it fetches the CSRN for breakout to the CS domain.\nIf a UE has an ongoing IMS voice over PS session, the T-ADS shall select the PS domain when delivering an incoming session to the same UE.\nWhen using Gm reference point, T-ADS for ICS UE sessions may be executed in the ICS UE in conjunction with the network, based on user preferences, operator policy and taking into account its own capabilities and those of the access network.",

The existing mobility management mechanisms are used in the UE and the CS network.\nWhen performing a successful Location Update for the UE, the MSC Server has received the subscriber data from the HSS/HLR. This subscriber data may include an optional flag per VPLMN.\nAn MSC Server that is enhanced for ICS shall then perform the following:\n-\tIf the flag is received and is supported by the MSC Server, then the MSC Server shall analyse the value of the flag as follows:\n-\tIf the flag is set to true and optionally if the MSC Server is configured to know that the VPLMN has a suitable roaming agreement with the HPLMN of the UE, the MSC Server shall attempt the IMS registration using the I2 reference point.\n-\tIf the flag is set to false, the MSC Server shall not attempt the IMS registration.\n-\tIf the flag is not received or is not supported, the MSC Server may perform some pre-screening (e.g. IMSI range analysis) based on operator-policy in order to determine whether or not to attempt IMS registration for this subscriber.\nNOTE 1:\tExact pre‑screening procedures are operator specific.\nNOTE 2:\tAn MSC Server that is not enhanced for ICS will ignore the flag and thus will continue normal CS operation.\nIf the MSC Server decides not to perform registration in the IMS, the MSC Server falls back to the behaviour of an MSC Server that is not enhanced for ICS.\nIf the network is in NMO I configuration, the mobility management procedures using Gs interface triggers the MSC Server enhanced for ICS to perform IMS registration.\nWhen attempting initial IMS registration on behalf of the ICS User, the MSC Server shall derive a home IMS domain name using the identity of the subscriber (e.g. IMSI). This domain name identifies the node (e.g. I‑CSCF or IBCF) to which the MSC Server shall send the IMS registration. The MSC Server shall also derive IMS user identities required for the registration from this identity. The MSC Server shall derive these identities in a manner that prevents collisions with other identities automatically derived from the same subscriber identity. See clause 4.6.2 of the present document for more information on the identities used.\nThe MSC Server then initiates a registration on behalf of the ICS User towards the home IMS indicating support for GRUU and including an InstanceID. If a GRUU is received, the MSC Server shall store it. The MSC Server shall not apply the mechanism for multiple simultaneous registrations.\nNOTE 3:\tIMS authorization of registrations from an MSC Server enhanced for ICS is defined in clause 9.\nThe MSC Server shall indicate in the registration the media capabilities that it supports (as listed in TS 22.101 [9]).\nThe routing of the registration messaging is performed by standard IMS routing procedures. The S‑CSCF shall perform 3rd party registration towards the SCC AS. The SCC AS shall obtain from the S‑CSCF the necessary information related to the contact address for performing T‑ADS.\nIf the S-CSCF receives IMS de-registration from MSC, or receives IMS registration from new MSC while there is a valid IMS registration from old MSC, the S-CSCF releases the existing sessions which includes early session as defined in TS 24.229 [31].\nIf IMS registration is successful, then subsequent IMS sessions described in clause 4.4.2 shall be supported in IMS using the MSC Server procedures described in this specification.\nThe success or failure of the IMS registration shall not impact the CS attach status of the UE.\nThe MSC Server enhanced for ICS shall initiate IMS re-registration as necessary to maintain an active IMS registration during the period of time in which the UE is attached to the CS domain.\nNOTE 4:\tDue to the MSC Server not applying the mechanism for multiple simultaneous registrations, this results in the behaviour of when a UE attaches to a new MSC Server enhanced for ICS and the old MSC Server enhanced for ICS has not deregistered the user, the new registration over-writes the existing one in the S‑CSCF.\nAfter successful initial IMS registration, the MSC Server enhanced for ICS shall subscribe to the registration event package described in TS 23.228 [2] on behalf of the ICS User. The MSC Server shall use the default Public User Identity received during initial IMS registration for subscription to this package. The MSC Server enhanced for ICS shall refresh this subscription as necessary during the period of time in which its IMS registration on behalf of the ICS User is active.\nThe MSC Server enhanced for ICS shall initiate IMS deregistration on behalf of the ICS User upon receipt of any indication that the UE is no longer considered active at this MSC Server (e.g. Location Cancellation procedure, Purge MS procedure, etc.). In order to ensure that the registration request from the target MSC Server arrives at the S‑CSCF prior to the deregistration request from the source MSC Server, the MSC Server should delay the deregistration procedure, such as by starting a timer. If the S‑CSCF finds an existing binding upon receiving the deregistration request as specified in TS 24.229 [31] and identifies that is a request initiated by the MSC Server enhanced for ICS on behalf of the ICS User, the S‑CSCF shall compare the contact address in the deregistration request with the contact address in the existing binding using the URI comparison rules. If it agrees, the S‑CSCF will remove the existing binding. Otherwise, the de-registration request fails. Per operator policy, the MSC Server enhanced for ICS shall also initiate IMS re-registrations to obtain additional temporary-GRUUs as need.\nUpon receipt of a network-initiated deregistration from the IMS, the MSC Server enhanced for ICS shall remove all registration details relating to the Public User Identities contained in the deregistration. Network-initiated deregistration from IMS shall not impact the UE's CS registration status.",

The ICS UE also sets up a standard CS originated session addressing a PSI DN associated with the SCC AS to establish the CS bearer if a CS bearer is not available for the ICS UE. The CS bearer shall be reused if already established using the Gm reference point. The service control signalling is combined with the description of the CS bearer at the SCC AS for presentation of the IMS originating session to the S‑CSCF over the Remote Leg.\nWhen a subsequent session origination with different CS bearer requirement occurs (i.e. CS audio bearer is changed to CS video bearer, or vice versa), the CS bearer shall be updated if possible through SCUDIF or redial (refer to clause 7.9.2).\nThe ICS UE should be able to detect an emergency session establishment request. If the ICS UE using a CS access detects the request for the establishment of an emergency session, the ICS UE shall attempt to initiate a CS emergency call.\nIf the ICS UE could not detect an emergency call and originates the session with CS media using Gm reference point, it will forward an IMS session establishment request to the P‑CSCF. If the P‑CSCF detects such an emergency call, it rejects the request with an indication that this is for an emergency session as described in TS 23.167 [25].\nNOTE:\tIf the P‑CSCF is not ICS aware, it is assumed that some other node in the emergency session path will detect the unsupported media and reject it or the call will be delivered to the PSAP without voice media component. Normal error handling applies in this case.\nAs described in TS 23.167 [25], an ICS UE that initiated a non UE detectable emergency session will receive an indication in responses from which it can deduce that the session is for emergency. Upon receiving an emergency session rejection or session rejection with this indication, the ICS UE shall fall back to CS according to TS 23.167 [25].\nWhen not using the Gm reference point, the following apply:\n-\tFor sessions originated using a B party's SIP URI (not using user = phone), the ICS UE initiates a dialogue with the SCC AS over the I1 reference point indicating session origination. The ICS UE also sets up a CS originated session addressing a PSI DN associated with the SCC AS to establish the CS bearer. The service control signalling is combined with the description of the CS bearer at the SCC AS for presentation of the IMS originating session to the S‑CSCF over the Remote Leg.\n-\tFor all other cases, the ICS UE initiates a standard CS originating call using B party's E.164 number. The call is routed to IMS via a standard MSC Server using IN (e.g. CAMEL) based redirection or an MSC Server enhanced with ICS. If the B party number is detected by the MSC Server as an emergency number then it will be handled as per existing MSC Server call handling procedures. Additionally, the ICS UE may use the I1 reference point for communication of additional parameters.\nFor video call originating sessions that use CS media, the following apply:\n-\tWhen the ICS UE is attached to the MSC Server enhanced for ICS, after the multimedia connection is established, the MSC Server enhanced for ICS shall perform the video codec negotiation for the ICS UE and set up the video media bearer based upon the procedures defined in TS 29.163 [11] for 3GPP systems and based on the procedures defined in 3GPP2 C.S0042 [38] for 3GPP2 systems;\n-\tWhen the ICS UE is attached to the MSC Server not enhanced for ICS, the MGCF/IMS-MGW shall perform the video codec negotiation for the ICS UE and set up the video media bearer as specified in TS 29.163 [11] for 3GPP systems and as specified in 3GPP2 C.S0042 [38] for 3GPP2 systems.\nThe following clauses show pairs of flows, one for an ICS UE when using an MSC Server and the other for an MSC Server enhanced for ICS. They are for the most part identical except that in the case of an MSC Server enhanced for ICS the INVITE towards the SCC AS is sent directly from the MSC Server whereas an MSC Server sends an ISUP IAM and the MGCF interworks this to an INVITE towards the SCC AS.\nA \"Gm origination with CS media\" policy may be provisioned by the operator and communicated to the ICS UE during initial provisioning or via OMA Device Management [24].\nNOTE 1:\tOperators who choose to make use of ICS UEs may update this policy in order to optimize the user experience depending on knowledge of the capabilities of the Home PLMN and Visited PLMN (if roaming), in particular whether the MSC Server is enhanced for ICS, whether IN re-routing is possible and whether the ICS UE may be handed over to a non DTM-enabled GERAN.\nFor originating sessions that use CS media, when the use of the Gm reference point is possible, the ICS UE shall behave as follows, depending on the \"Gm origination with CS media\" policy:\n-\tif this policy is set to \"Gm disabled\", then the ICS UE shall not use the procedure specified in clause 7.3.2.2.4.\n-\tif this policy is set to \"Gm enabled but not preferred\", then:\n-\tif the destination is a Tel URI or a SIP-URI representing a telephone number, and the exchange of additional SIP parameters is not required, then the ICS UE shall not use the procedure specified in clause 7.3.2.2.4;\n-\totherwise, the ICS UE shall use the procedure specified in clause 7.3.2.2.4.\n-\tif this policy is set to \"Gm enabled\", then the ICS UE shall use the procedure specified in clause 7.3.2.2.4.\nNOTE 2:\tWhen setting the \"Gm origination with CS media\" policy to the ICS UE, the home operator is able to consider whether the MSC in VPLMN has been enhanced for ICS or not, and in the latter case the operator can enable the Gm reference point for ICS service control.

It enables IMS services when using CS access for the media bearer.\nWith ICS, the user services are provided by IMS. User sessions are controlled in IMS via PS or CS access. When using CS access network, or when using PS access networks which do not support full duplex speech component of an IMS service, the CS core network is utilized to establish a circuit bearer for use as media for IMS sessions.\nFunctionality is needed to provide IMS Centralized Services to devices using a circuit switched access network for media transport. Two fundamentally different approaches are enabled in this specification. One approach supports legacy UEs by placing new functional elements in the MSC Server. Another approach provides new functionality in the UE. The following figure depicts the provision of IMS Centralized Services for these approaches from the user's perspective. This figure is intended to be illustrative in nature, and is not intended to depict a complete or definitive identification of the various IMS Centralized Services that may be provided using different access networks or solutions.\nFigure A-1: IMS Centralized Services\nAnnex B (informative):ICS functions in different deployment scenarios\nThe following tables provides guidance on which of the functions and functionalities are needed in the different deployment scenarios.\nScenario 1: An operator who only supports UEs that have ICS functionality for their ICS Users:\nMSC Server with ICS\nICS UE\nTransparent control channel\nSCC AS\nenhancements\nI1\nGm\nCAA\nIUA\nT-ADS\nRequired\nNo\nYes\nAs driven by operator policy and VPLMN support.\nAs driven by operator policy and VPLMN support.\nYes, only if I1 is supported\nYes\nYes\nICS Users using a non-ICS UE (e.g. after SIM swap) will not make use of the transparent control channel; non ICS UE originated calls are routed to the home IMS using IN (e.g. CAMEL) signalling in conjunction with CS signalling (e.g. TS 24.008 [6]) for call origination.\nScenario 2: An operator who only supports non ICS UEs for their ICS Users:\nMSC Server with ICS\nICS UE\nTransparent control channel\nSCC AS\nenhancements\nI1\nGm\nCAA\nIUA\nT-ADS\nRequired\nYes\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nConditional*\nYes\n* Required if the operator supports IN (e.g. CAMEL) redirection of CS originated calls.\nScenario 3: An operator who supports UE's for their ICS Users that do, and do not, have ICS functionality (to different subscribers and the same subscribers) ensuring the coexistence of UEs that have and do not have ICS functionality:\nMSC Server with ICS\nICS UE\nTransparent control channel\nSCC AS\nenhancements\nI1\nGm\nCAA\nIUA\nT-ADS\nRequired\nYes\nYes\nAs driven by operator policy and VPLMN support.\nAs driven by operator policy and VPLMN support.\nYes, if I1 is supported\nYes\nYes\nScenario 4: Inbound roaming - operator supports ICS\nInbound roaming subscribers on an operator's network that supports either the same or different ICS functionality that the inbound roaming subscriber is using, ensuring the coexistence of UEs that have and do not have ICS functionality.\nSub case 4.1: Subscriber from operator supporting scenario 1 roams into network of scenario 1\nSame functions and functionalities in roaming in-network as in scenario 1. No additional functions or functionalities.\nSub case 4.2: Subscriber from operator supporting scenario 2 roams into network of scenario 2\nSame functions and functionalities in roaming in-network as in scenario 2. No additional functions or functionalities.\nSub case 4.3: Subscriber from operator supporting scenario 1 roams into network of scenario 2\nSame functions and functionalities in roaming in-network as in scenario 2. No additional functions or functionalities. Roaming agreement, operator policy and access network restrictions decide on the use of the transparent control channel between ICS UE and SCC AS in the home network.\nICS Users using a non-ICS UE (e.g. after SIM swap) will not make use of the transparent control channel; non ICS UE originated calls are routed to the home IMS using IN (e.g. CAMEL) signalling in conjunction with CS signalling (e.g. TS 24.008 [6]) for call origination.\nSub case 4.4: Subscriber from operator supporting scenario 2 roams into network of scenario 1\nSame functions and functionalities in roaming in-network as in scenario 1: No additional functions or functionalities. Roaming agreement and operator policy decide on the fallback solution, i.e., whether or not originated calls are routed to the home IMS using IN (e.g. CAMEL) signalling in conjunction with CS signalling (e.g. TS 24.008 [6]) for call origination.\nScenario 5: Inbound roaming - operator does not support ICS\nInbound roaming subscribers on an operator's network that does not support ICS.\nSub case 5.1: Subscriber from operator supporting scenario 1 roams into an operator's network that does not support ICS.\nRoaming agreement, operator policy and access network restrictions decide on the use of the transparent control channel between ICS UE and SCC AS in the home network.\nICS Users using a non-ICS UE (e.g. after SIM swap) will not make use of the transparent control channel; non ICS UE originated calls are routed to the home IMS using IN (e.g. CAMEL) signalling in conjunction with CS signalling (e.g. TS 24.008 [6]) for call origination.\nSub case 5.2 Subscriber from operator supporting scenario 2 roams into an operator's network that does not support ICS.\nRoaming agreement and operator policy decide on the fallback solution, i.e., whether or not originated calls are routed to the home IMS using IN (e.g. CAMEL) signalling in conjunction with CS signalling (e.g. TS 24.008 [6]) for call origination.\nAnnex C (informative):Communication Deflection support when call has been delivered using CS call control\nWhen a call has been delivered to a non ICS UE using CS call control, Communication Deflection service can be centralized and executed in IMS by using IN (e.g. O-CSI CAMEL) if it is supported by the network and user subscription.\nAnnex D (informative):Conditional Call Forwarding support when call has been delivered using CS call control\nWhen a call has been delivered to an UE using CS call control, conditional call forwarding services can be centralized and executed in IMS by one of (or a combination of) the following implementation options.\nSolution 1: Default PSIs\nIn this solution, Conditional CF is configured in IMS with default service configuration in the CS domain. The Conditional CF services are configured in the HLR. The different forwarded number can be set in HLR to indicate the type of CF. The VMSC redirects the call to IMS for appropriate handling of the service in IMS.\nSolution 2: MAP suppression-of-announcements\nIn this solution, Conditional CF is configured and provisioned in IMS domain exclusively, according to IMS Centralized Service principle. It provides means to suppress the announcement in CS domain at the MSC for the conditional call forwarding services. MGCF provides the appropriate responses to TAS on behalf of the ICS user in CS domain. The MGCF can use the ICS indication if available to map cause codes received over the CS leg to appropriate IMS error codes.\nFor support of CFNRy, the TAS starts a supervisory no-reply timer on receipt of Alerting from the called party. If the timer expires without receipt of the Connect from the called party, the TAS invokes the CFNRy service.\nSolution 3: IN\nIn this solution, Conditional CF is configured in IMS with default service configuration in the CS domain so that the VMSC invokes the CF service in the CS domain upon detection of CF triggers. IN (e.g. O-CSI CAMEL service) is configured in the HLR to redirect service control to IMS for processing of CF.\nAnnex E (informative):Using MRF for media process\nAfter the session between ICS UE and other party ( Party B) is hold, if the SCC AS receives the new session request, it can use MRF for media process. The following three options give details on how to implement it.\nSolution 1: using MRFP by SCC AS for held party\nIn this solution, if the SCC AS receives the new session request after the session between ICS UE and other party (Party B) is hold, it changes the MGW media path from Party B to the third party (Party C), and connects Party B to MRF for playing announcement.\nSolution 2: using MRFP by SCC AS for active and Held party\nIn this solution, if the SCC AS receives the new session request after the session between ICS UE and other party (Party B) is hold, it changes the MGW media path to MRF, and then connects Party B to MRF for playing announcement and connects the third party (Party C) to MRF to communicate with ICS UE.\nSolution 3: using MRFP by TAS for Held call\nIn this solution, TAS is always kept in ICS UE A's remote leg. After the TAS receives the Hold request from the ICS UE via the SCC AS, it performs communication Hold procedure as described in TS 24.147 [21]. The MRF is connected to Party B for playing announcement.\nAnnex F (informative):Call diversion from CS to IMS\nF.1\tGeneral\nAn incoming call for a subscriber with a service provided by the IMS (e.g. ICS, SC, SR-VCC) can be received either through the CS domain or IMS. For such a subscriber, certain calls that are received through the CS domain need to be routed to the IMS for anchoring at the SCC AS, prior to the onward routing of the call to the subscriber. Solutions for this are discussed in clause F.2.\nNOTE:\tRequirements and preconditions for anchoring of CS calls for a subscriber with a service provided by the IMS are documented in clause 7.4 of the present document.\nWhen an incoming CS call is anchored at the SCC AS using certain implementation options described in clause F.2, then as a result of domain selection, the call can be routed back to the CS domain to determine the CSRN for CS termination. In this case, the call can be treated as a new incoming call from the CS network, and then be re-routed to the IMS for anchoring again, thus creating a circular loop. Solutions for this are discussed in clause F.3.\nF.2\tImplementation options for call diversion from CS to the IMS\nSeveral techniques available in the current CS networks can be used to implement the call diversion from CS to IMS, as detailed below:\n1\tUse of CAMEL for call diversion to IMS\nThis option applies to configurations requiring handling of incoming calls at the GMSC function. Upon receipt of an incoming call, the GMSC queries the HSS for routing information via the Send Routing Information (SRI) query. The user profile in the HSS is configured to return T-CSI including a gsmSCF address to the GMSC in response to the SRI query. When handling calls for a subscriber with a service provided by the IMS, the subsequent processing at the gsmSCF and the GMSC results in routing of the call to the IMS using the IMRN. The call is routed to the SCC AS according to standard IMS routing procedures. In order to determine the necessary information to complete the call, the SCC AS uses the IMRN or the ISUP information mapped to SIP headers.\n2\tHSS directed call diversion to IMS\nThis option also applies to configurations requiring handling of incoming calls at the GMSC function. Upon receipt of an incoming call, the GMSC queries the HSS for routing information using the MAP Send Routing Information (SRI) procedure (as defined in TS 29.002 [45]). Based on a non-standardized mechanism, the user profile in the HSS is configured to return an IP Multimedia Routing Number (IMRN) to the GMSC in response to the SRI query, when the call is directed to a subscriber with a service provided by the IMS. The subsequent processing at the GMSC results in routing of the call to IMS using the IMRN. Two methods can then be used to ensure correlation between the IMRN and the original called party.\na.\tCooperative allocation/deallocation: In this method, the IMS is made aware of the assigned IMRN and when a call is received for that number, the original number is retrieved. This method is similar to the Provide Roaming Number procedure in MAP (see TS 29.002 [45]).\nb.\tAlgorithmic: In this method, a known algorithm is used to derive the IMRN at the CS, and to deduce the original called number from the IMRN at the IMS. One method of performing such an algorithm could be use of a prefix. In such a case, care is required in the network configuration to avoid call looping for the case when the call is subsequently routed from the IMS to the CS domain for call termination (see clause F.3 for possible solutions to prevent call looping).\n3\tStatic diversion from GMSC with dedicated trunk groups\nThis option also applies to configurations requiring handling of incoming calls at the GMSC function. Dedicated trunk groups can be used at the GMSC to divert CS terminations to the MGCF.\nNOTE 1:\tThe handling of call types that an operator has not centralised the services into the IMS need to be taken into account if this solution is chosen.\n4\tStatic diversion using Local Number Portability\nThis option can be used for routing of calls originating in PSTN networks to IMS. A Local Number Portability database dip can be used to reroute incoming calls to a subscriber with a service provided by the IMS with calls to the MGCF.\nNOTE 2:\tThe handling of calls other than calls needs to be taken into account if this solution is chosen.\n5\tDirect routing to IMS\nTranslations can be set up in the PSTN network to route the incoming call to a subscriber with a service provided by the IMS to the MGCF. This way the normal IMS routing technique specified in TS 23.228 [2] can be used.\nNOTE 3:\tThe handling of call types that an operator has not centralised the services into the IMS need to be taken into account if this solution is chosen.\nNOTE 4:\tWith some of the aforementioned options, care must be taken to avoid a circular loop which can occur when used in conjunction with certain techniques applied to route the call from IMS to the terminating user via CS network. Techniques for the prevention of circular looping are described in clause F.3.\nF.3\tImplementation options for prevention of circular looping of CS Terminations\nSeveral implementation techniques can be used to avoid circular looping, as detailed below:\n1\tUse of SCC AS for retrieving the  CSRN\nWhen the SCC AS decides that the call is to be terminated in the CS domain, the SCC AS retrieves the CSRN from the MSC/MSC-Server via the HSS using the following method:\na.\tMAP SRI Query: This option makes use of a MAP Interface between the SCC AS and the HSS to request allocation of a CSRN from the HSS for routing of the call to the MSC/MSC-Server currently serving the subscriber.\nb.\tSh UDR Query: This option makes use of the Sh interface between the SCC AS and the HSS. The SCC AS sends a Sh UDR query to the HSS to request allocation of a CSRN for routing of the call to the MSC/MSC-Server currently serving the subscriber.\n2\tUse of a specific CSRN to indicate the anchored call\nWhen the SCC AS decides that the call is to be terminated in the CS domain, the SCC AS allocates a specific CSRN. The specific CSRN can be an MSISDN with added prefix digits. The SCC AS uses the specific CSRN to route the call to the CS network. The following options are available to resolve the MSISDN of original called party from the CSRN.\na.\tMGCF resolution: In this option, the SCC AS forwards the call to the MGCF (which has a GMSC function). The specific CSRN is used by the MGCF to recognise that the SCC AS has already anchored the call in IMS, and that the call will be terminated in the CS domain. The MGCF resolves the MSISDN from the CSRN and invokes GMSC functionality integrated in the MGCF for handling the CS call terminating procedure. In particular, the MGCF/GMSC includes the \"Suppress T-CSI\" parameter in the MAP SRI sent to the HSS.\nb.\tGMSC resolution: In this option, the SCC AS forwards the call to the MGCF, which then forwards the call on to GSMC. The specific CSRN is used by the GSMC to recognise that the SCC AS has already anchored the call in IMS, and that the call will be terminated in the CS domain. The GMSC resolves the MSISDN from the CSRN and invokes the CS call terminating procedure. In particular, the GMSC includes the \"Suppress T CSI\" parameter in the MAP SRI sent to the HSS.\nc\tHSS resolution: In this option, the SCC AS forwards the call to the GMSC. The GMSC treats the call as a normal terminating call and sends a MAP SRI request to the HSS for the specific CSRN. The specific CSRN is used by the HSS to recognise that the SCC AS has already anchored the call in IMS, and that the call will be terminated in the CS domain. The HSS resolves the MSISDN from the CSRN and uses CS call terminating procedures to obtain routing information from the MSC/MSC-Server.\n3\tUse of a dynamically allocated CSRN to route via the GMSC\nThis option uses a dynamically allocated CSRN to divert the call to the appropriate GMSC as described below:\n-\tThe SCC AS allocates a CSRN that maps to an appropriate GMSC. Standard CS termination procedures are then executed at the GMSC.\n-\tThe GMSC is configured with N-CSI and criteria corresponding to the CSRN. This causes the GMSC to issue an InitialDP containing the CSRN to the gsmSCF.\n-\tThe gsmSCF performs a function on the CSRN to obtain the MSISDN of the called party number and the MSISDN is returned to the GMSC in a CONNECT operation together with the CSRN as a Re-direction ID.\n-\tThe GMSC continues the normal CS call termination procedure by issuing an SRI to the HSS using the MSISDN, which causes T-CSI to be returned back to the GMSC.\n-\tThe GMSC issues another InitialDP containing both MSISDN and CSRN to the gsmSCF. The gsmSCF recognises that it has been triggered for the second time (due to the presence of the CSRN) and therefore returns a CONTINUE for the MSISDN, thus avoiding a circular loop.\n-\tThe GMSC sends a MAP SRI query to the HSS with the \"Suppress T CSI\" parameter, thus allowing the HSS to obtain the MSRN through standard call terminating procedures.\nAnnex G (normative):Combined CS Access Authentication and IMS Registration Procedure for non-roaming UEs\nG.1\tGeneral\nAn MSC enhanced for ICS may support the Combined CS Access Authentication procedure. This procedure enables to authenticate and register all users accessing a network via CS access within the IMS domain as the only service domain. When this is done this annex is used instead of clause 7.2.1.1.\nIf the MSC enhanced for ICS supports the Combined CS Access Authentication all users within this MSC domain shall be authenticated utilizing this procedure.\nThe main additional function of MSC Server enhanced for ICS is:\n-\tReceiving 3G CS authentication parameters from the S-CSCF.\nOther functions are similar with the existing MSC Server enhanced for ICS, e.g. Controls the MGW functions described in TS 23.002 [3] to enable the interworking between CS access and RTP bearers.\nIn this solution, the IMS will perform authentication procedure as normal IMS registration.\nG.2\tProcedure for registration utilizing IMS Authorization\nFigure G.2-1 describes how IMS registration is performed by the MSC Server upon receiving of a Location Update Request.\nFigure G.2-1: Procedure for registration utilizing IMS Authorization\n1.\tThe UE sends a Location Update Request towards CS network.\n2-3.\tUpon receipt of location update request, MSC Server enhanced for ICS performs standard identity request if needed.\n4.\tThe MSC Server enhanced for ICS decides to initiate IMS registration for this subscriber and derives a domain name from the subscriber's identity (e.g. IMSI) and discovers the address of the appropriate I-CSCF/IBCF.\n5-7.\tThe I-CSCF verifies that the incoming REGISTER origins from a trusted MSC Server (in the same way it would check that a normal REGISTER origins from a trusted P-CSCF). The I-CSCF compares the MNC/MCC in the IMPI/IMPU to detect whether the UE is an inbound roamer or not. For HPLMN subscribers the I-CSCF selects the HSS and for inbound roamers follows the procedure in Annex H, clause H.5.2.3.1.\nFor HPLMN SeDoC subscribers, the I-CSCF indicates to the HSS that the REGISTER is coming from an MSC and the HSS selects the appropriate S-CSCF which is able to handle the CS authentication. The I‑CSCF initiates standard procedures for S‑CSCF location/allocation and forwards the REGISTER to S-CSCF.\n8-9.\tThe S-CSCF identifies the REGISTER as being from the MSC Server enhanced for ICS.\nDuring these procedures, authentication parameters for a given subscriber will be carried. The parameters contain an Authentication Quintuplet (Rand, Xres, Ck, Ik, Autn).\n10-11.\tThe S‑CSCF sends a SIP 401 i.e. an authentication challenge towards the UE including the challenge RAND, the authentication token AUTN, and also the integrity key IK and the cipher key CK to MSC Server enhanced for ICS.\n12.\tUpon receipt of 401 from IMS, MSC Server enhanced for ICS initiates the authentication procedure by transferring an AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message across the radio interface. The AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message contains the parameters necessary to calculate the response parameters.\n13.\tThe UE processes the challenge information and sends back an AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message to the network.\n14.\tThe MSC Server enhanced for ICS should send REGISTER with authentication result (XRES) to I-CSCF.\n15-21.\tI‑CSCF forwards the authentication response to the S‑CSCF. Upon receiving the message, the S‑CSCF check the authentication response sent by the UE. If the user has been successfully authenticated, the S‑CSCF sends 200 OK to MSC Server enhanced for ICS via I-CSCF.\n22.\tOn receiving a 200 (OK) response to the REGISTER request, the MSC Server enhanced for ICS generates a TMSI for the UE and sends Location Update Accept towards the UE.\nAnnex H (informative):Service Domain Centralization in IMS (SeDoC)\nH.1\tHigh level description and principles\nThis annex describes an optional architecture configuration that centralizes all services, including emergency calls and SMS, within the IMS domain for all users roaming in that network independent of access used, i.e. it replaces service execution of the CS service domain with service logic execution in IMS only. The service profile for all users is soley provided by the IMS domain. For inbound roamers not supporting IMS or ICS in HPLMN therefore a temporary IMS subscription is created and service is handled locally in the VPLMN.\nThe architecture configuration utilizes the \"Registration and Authentication procedure utilizing IMS Authorization\", which enables the option to remove subscriber related data from the VLR and use data of the IMS domain instead, e.g. the HSS. An interworking function provides the support for inbound and outbound roaming in networks not supporting IMS or ICS.\nThis architecture configuration has no impact to UEs, no impact to interconnection interfaces of the roaming partner, no impact access networks (e.g. CS access) and does not require changes of specifications (e.g. TS 24.008 [6]).\nThe basic principles of this solution are that CS access is mapped to IMS and PS access uses \"native\" IMS (VoLTE) but there is a single service domain for both accesses in IMS. The user profile is solely provided by IMS domain. For the migration phase the SeDoC enabled network operator is required to provide legacy support for inbound roamers. Long term target is that the service for inbound roamer be provided by the HPLMN, i.e. the VPLMN IMS-GWs (IBCFs) would relay towards home IMS service infrastructure.\nH.2\tArchitecture model and reference points\nH.2.1\tReference architecture\nThe basic principles described in previous clause require the introduction of a CS access to IMS gateway function, i.e. the MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC and an interworking function (ICS IWF) to the reference architecture. The MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC maps GSM access procedures to IMS procedures but does not store user profile data, i.e. the VLR functionality is extracted and is placed for own users into the HSS and for inbound roamer into an ICS-IWF. By doing this the internal IMS architecture does not need to introduce new interfaces.\nFigure H.2-1: Reference architecture\nNOTE:\tDoes only show the principle architecture, i.e. it does not show all interfaces.\nH.2.2\tFunctional Entities\nH.2.2.1\tMSC Server enhanced for SeDoC\nThe MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC terminates CS Access and maps it to respective IMS procedures.\nNOTE:\tWhen only a single profile in the IMS is used for service definition then a MSC Server enhanced for ICS (as defined in clause 7.6.2.9.3) is not used, instead a MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC is used in its place.\nAt high level the MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC performs the following functionality on the control plane:\n-\ttowards the UE:\n-\tterminates the A (GERAN) and Iu-cs interfaces (UTRAN) when the UE accesses via a CS RAT.\n-\ttowards the IP Multimedia Subsystem:\n-\tTerminates the I2' interface to the x-CSCF.\n-\tTerminates I3 to the Telephony Application Server.\n-\ttowards legacy networks:\n-\tterminates the G and E interface towards MSC Servers.\n-\tterminates ISUP signalling towards PSTN.\nOn the media plane the MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC controls Mc to the Media gateway.\nH.2.2.1.1\tMain differences to MSC Server enhanced for ICS\nThe MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC is based on the MSC Server enhanced for ICS, associated MGW as defined in clause 5.3.3 of this specification, TS 23.216 [36] and TS 23.237 [12] with the following amendments.\nH.2.2.1.2\tCall control solely done in IMS\nCall Control (CC) functionality is essentially required only for the A/Iu-cs side of the MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC. Some local call control i.e.to treat \"non UE detected emergency call\" (Germany: 110) as emergency call and. route to E-CSCF is required. Remaining Call Control functionality is done by IMS in the same way as for PS calls. Therefore the MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC behaves as P-CSCF/ATCF from viewpoint of I/S/E-CSCF, SCC-AS and MSC.\nRadio Resource Management (RR) and Mobility Management (MM) remain unchanged.\nH.2.2.1.3\tNo VLR functionality\nMSC Server enhanced for SeDoC does not include VLR functionality, i.e. there is also no D-Interface to the HLR. User Service Profile data and user service profile (i.e. identity, supplementary services) are handled in the IMS domain only. MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC just need to store user data related to radio access and RR/MM/CC procedures (e.g. IMSI, IMEI, TMSI, etc.).\nH.2.2.1.4\tMapping of CS procedures to IMS procedures\nThe MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC terminates CS Access and maps it to respective IMS procedures.\nH.2.2.1.5\tCall Control procedures\nCall Control procedures from the mobile CS user interface (A, Iu) are mapped towards IMS interface, i.e. I2 (SIP) towards IMS core in order to support the mapping of:\n-\tMOC & MTC based on A/Iu to respective IMS procedures\n-\tSMS-MO & SMS-MT based on A/Iu to respective IMS/IP-SM procedures\nH.2.2.1.6\tSupplementary Services Management procedures\nSupplementary Services Management procedures from the mobile CS user interface (A, Iu) are mapped towards IMS interfaces, i.e. I3-IF (Ut, XCAP) towards IMS MMTEL AS.\nH.2.2.1.7\tMapping of IMS procedures to CS procedures\nIMS specific procedures that need to be mapped to appropriate GSM procedures are:\n-\tearly media (uni/bi-directional through-connect of media path).\n-\tmultiple early dialogues (due to forking on remote side (e.g. MSIM scenario):\n-\ti.e. MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC serving the originating user needs to map multiple early SIP dialogues to one GSM dialogue towards the GSM device.\nSRVCC is supported as specified for GSM MSC (TS 23.216 [36]), i.e. via Sv Interface to MME and via I2 Interface to ATCF. Reverse SRVCC is supported as specified for GSM MSC (TS 23.216 [36]).\nCSFB support for Voice and SMS over SGs interface to MME, in case of combined attach to EPC and CS (via SGs), the MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC needs to interact with the IMS core similar as for CS attached voice terminals (e.g. map Location Update to IMS Registration, etc.)\nH.2.2.1.8\tProcedures which can be handled without IMS interaction\nVarious MSC-Server procedures which can be handled without IMS interaction remain within the MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC. This includes e.g. handover to/from other MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC or VMSC (original MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC remains anchor after handover).\nH.2.2.1.9\tSMS support considerations\nIn order to properly support SMS a SIP based replacement for MAP based SMS alerting procedures (reachability check) is needed, i.e. to set \"not reachable\" flag in case of unsuccessful SMS-MT and re-register if user is reachable again.\nUpon unsuccessful SMS-MT delivery (no response from terminal) the MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC needs to activate a \"Not Reachable\" (NR) flag (similar to GSM MSC). In case of \"NR flag = TRUE\" and receipt of any message from the terminal, the MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC needs to re-register towards IMS-Core.\nIn case of unsuccessful SMS-MT to an attached user, the IP-SM-GW shall not initiate supervision in packet core network (Sh request to HSS).\nAfter unsuccessful SMS-MT delivery, the IP-SM-GW sets a \"Not Reachable\" flag. Due to this flag a re-registration (and other messages received from the terminal) will trigger the standard retry mechanisms.\nH.2.2.1.10\tLocation\nMSC Server enhanced for SeDoC provides with PANI header the network provided location information according to cell-id received from radio access network (RAN). This information may be used by applications to differentiate between 2/3G Access via MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC and 4G Access via P-CSCF.\nH.2.2.1.11\tCS Data support\nCS Data is used analogously to a voice call: A data terminal equipment (modem) establishes a connection to another terminal (modem). The connection setup is controlled by the IMS Core, the data stream can be transported transparently with already available codecs (e.g., \"clear mode\"/G7.11).\nH.2.2.2\tICS Interworking Function\nThe ICS interworking function is introduced in order to support inbound and outbound roamers in networks that do not support IMS or ICS. Detailed in clause H.5.2.2.\nH.2.3\tReference points\nH.2.3.1\tReference Point MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC - CSCF (I2' Reference Point)\nThe I2' reference point is based on I2 functionality as defined in TS 23.216 [36], TS 23.237 [12] and in clause 5.4.2.\nAdditionally it supports the \"Registration and Authentication procedure utilizing IMS Authorization\" as specified in annex G.\nH.2.3.2\tReference Point MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC - TAS (I3 Reference Point)\nThe I3 is used between the MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC and the TAS to interwork CS signalling and communication service setting procedures, as defined in clause 4.5 of this specification.\nH.2.3.3\tReference Point ICS-IWF - CSCF (Cx' Reference Point)\nThe Cx' reference point is based on Cx functionality similar to the procedures of S-CSCF - HSS communication. It supports information transfer between CSCF and ICS-IWF.\nThe main procedures that require information transfer between CSCF and ICS-IWF are:\n1)\tProcedures related to Serving CSCF assignment\n2)\tProcedures related to routing information retrieval from ICS-IWF to CSCF\n3)\tProcedures related to authorisation (e.g. checking of roaming agreement)\n4)\tProcedures related to authentication: transfer of security parameters of the subscriber between ICS-IWF and CSCF\n5)\tProcedures related to filter control: transfer of filter parameters of the subscriber from ICS-IWF to CSCF\nFurther information on the Cx reference point is provided in TS 23.228 [2].\nH.2.3.4\tReference Point ICS-IWF - AS (Sh' Reference Point)\nThe Sh' reference point is based on Sh functionality similar to the procedures of AS - HSS communication. It supports information transfer between AS and HSS.\nH.4\tProcedures and flows for non roaming users\nH.4.1\tAuthentication/Registration for own users not roaming\nFor authentication/registration procedure for own users not roaming please refer to annex G of this specification.\nH.4.2\tOriginating session for own users not roaming\nSession origination for own users is specified in clause 7.3.2.1.2 Origination using I2 reference point\nH.4.3\tTerminating session for own users not roaming\nSession termination for own users is specified in clause 7.4.2.1.2 Termination using I2 reference point\nH.4.4\tSMS-MO for own users not roaming\nFigure H.4.4-1 SMS-MO for own users not roaming\n1)\tUE submits the standard CS Short Message (as described in TS 23.040 [50]and TS 24.011 [53]) to the MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC.\n2)\tMSC Server enhanced for SeDoC encapsulates the Short Message (SMS-SUBMIT, SC Address) and submits it to the S-CSCF using an appropriate SIP method (as described in TS 23.204 [51]and TS 24.341 [52]).\n3)\tS-CSCF forwards the encapsulated Short Message (SMS- SUBMIT, SC Address) to IP-SM-GW (AS) based on stored iFC.\n4)\tIP-SM-GW (AS) acknowledges the SIP message.\n5)\tSIP message acknowledge is forwarded by S-CSCF to MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC.\n6)\tThe IP-SM-GW performs service authorization based on the stored subscriber data. The IP SM GW checks whether the subscriber is authorised to use the short message service. The IP-SM-GW (AS) extracts the Short Message (SMS- SUBMIT) and forwards it towards the SMS-SC (SC Address) using standard MAP or Diameter based (SGd/Gdd) signalling (as described in TS 23.040 [50]).\n7)\tThe SMS-SC sends a Submit report (SMS-SUBMIT REPORT) to IP-SM-GW (AS) (see TS 23.040 [50]).\n8)\tIP-SM-GW (AS) sends the Submit report to S-CSCF, encapsulated in an appropriate SIP request.\n9)\tThe S-CSCF sends the encapsulated Submit report to the MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC.\n10)\tMSC Server enhanced for SeDoC sends the Submit report to the UE.\n11)\tThe MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC acknowledges the SIP request.\n12)\tThe S-CSCF acknowledges the SIP request.\nH.5\tInterworking with networks not supporting IMS and/or ICS\nH.5.1\tOverview\nIn this scenario, one network is fully supporting IMS and SeDoC but the interworking network does not support IMS or ICS.\nFor inbound roamers, the basic enhancement is to provide VLR services towards the HLR in the HPLMN in an interworking function for inbound roamers, which has the role of a centralized VLR.\nThe architecture is similar to the normal ICS architecture with the difference that the ICS Interworking Function is shared by all SeDoC -MSCs to support inbound roamers without IMS roaming agreement. The inbound roamers will have a temporary IMS subscription for the VPLMN, all services are executed in the VPLMN.\nFor outbound roaming UEs, it is the opposite way, i.e. the interworking function provides HLR services to the VLR in the VPLMN and in addition provides interworking of the IMS/CS profile and the service settings. The interworking function provides also signalling interworking towards the MSC in the VPLMN.\nH.5.2\tInbound-roaming support\nH.5.2.1\tRoaming Architecture with legacy home network\nFor the migration phase the SeDoC enabled network operator is required to provide legacy support for inbound roamers. The architecture proposed in this solution is for the SeDoC enabled visited network to emulate a VLR and allocate to the inbound CS roaming subscriber a temporary IMS identity so that they can also be served by the IMS domain.\nCAMEL can be supported by collocating the IP Multimedia Service Switching Function (IM SSF) with the AS. The IM SSF retrieves the CAMEL Subscription Information (CSI) from the ICS IWF at the time of the Attach of the UE. The IM SSF would perform the normal CAMEL requests to the gsmSCF in the HPLMN as specified in TS 23.278 [54].\nThe detailed architecture diagram is depicted in Figure H.5.2.1-1.\nFigure H.5.2.1-1: Architecture for inbound roamer support\nH.5.2.2\tIMS Centralized Services Interworking Function (ICS-IWF) Features\nThe ICS-IWF is necessary to support roaming scenarios. The interworking function terminates:\nthe Cx' interface towards the I-CSCF to provide the role of HSS for procedures related to Serving CSCF assignment.\nthe Cx' interface towards the S-CSCF for procedures related to routing information retrieval from ICS-IWF to CSCF and procedures related to authorisation (e.g. checking of roaming agreement) and procedures related to authentication: transfer of security parameters of the subscriber between ICS-IWF and CSCF\nthe C interface towards HLR for inbound roamer during migration phase to provide the role as VLR towards HLR to retrieve authentication and subscription data during authentication/registration procedure and to retrieve routing information for the terminating case\nthe Sh' interface for the role as HSS towards AS in VPLMN for local IMS registration,\nThe ICS-IWF provides the several roles:\n-\trole as VLR towards HPLMN HLR, i.e. in course of registration the ICS-IWF retrieves the user profile from HPLMN and creates a temporary user profile. The temporary user profile may be updated due to MAP ISD or deleted due to MAP Cancel or IMS de-registration or IMS registration time out.\n-\trole as HSS towards the S-CSCF in VPLMN for local IMS registration.\n-\trole as AS towards HSS in VPLMN for 3rd party IMS registration to enable terminating session routing to the VPLMN.\n- maps supplementary services management commands for inbound roamers to the respective CS MAP command to the HLR\n-\trole as HLR towards VLR for outbound roamers in a legacy network.\nH.5.2.3\tCall Flows for Inbound roamer\nH.5.2.3.1\tAuthentication/Registration for Inbound roamers\nThe main difference to the procedure for own users is that for inbound roamers the registration flow goes through an ICS IWF that acts as a HSS towards the I-CSCF and S-CSCF in the VPLMN and as a VLR towards the HPLMN HLR.\nFigure H.5.2.3.1-1: Authentication/Registration procedure for inbound roamer\n1.\t-7. Same as steps as in Annex G of this specification with the difference that in step 5, the I-CSCF detects the inbound roaming UE based on a comparison of the MNC/MCC in the IMPI/IMPU. The I-CSCF queries the IWF which may look up a database whether the MNC/MCC operator network (HPLMN of the inbound roaming UE) has an IMS roaming agreement or not. If there is no IMS roaming agreement or any other related Service Level Agreements (SLA) in place with this network, then the IWF selects an S-CSCF which is able to handle the CS authentication procedure and provides the S-CSCF address to the I-CSCF. I-CSCF marks the SIP REGISTER with an inbound roaming indication towards the S-CSCF.\nNOTE 1:\tSeDoC is a homogeneous service and all MSC Servers in the PLMN need to support it.\n8.\tThe S-CSCF identifies the REGISTER as being from the MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC for an inbound roamer. The S-CSCF requests the authentication info from the ICS IWF which acts as a HSS towards the S-CSCF.\n9.-13.The ICS-IWF acting as VLR retrieves the Authentication Info parameters (authentication quintets required for UMTS AKA) from the HLR. The ICS IWF retrieves the service profile via the D interface, i.e. it behaves like a VLR towards the HPLMN HLR by performing an Update Location Procedure and Insert Subscriber Data Procedure. The ICS IWF creates a temporary record (subscription profile). For invoking other AS(s), the ICS IWF generates the corresponding iFC(s).\nNOTE 2:\tSeDoC does not support 2G authentication.\n14-26. Same as steps 10.-22 Annex G of this specification.\nH.5.2.4\tOriginating session for Inbound roamer\nThe Origination session for inbound roamers is very similar to the Origination using I2 reference point as described in clause 7.3.2.1.2 of this specification with the difference that the S-CSCF and AS is located in the VPLMN.\nH.5.2.5\tTerminating session for Inbound roamer\nUEs which have been successfully registered in IMS by the MSC Server have a registration binding at the S‑CSCF containing the MSC Server as the contact address.\nThe SCC AS shall be inserted in the IMS session path using the terminating iFC. The SCC AS performs T-ADS for selection of an access and returns information to assist with S‑CSCF selection of a registered contact address. When the T-ADS function selects the MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC, the SCC AS directs the IMS terminating session towards the contact address of the MSC Server.\nOn receipt of the session initiation message, the MSC Server enhanced for ICS shall perform the necessary interworking between the I2 reference point and CS signalling (e.g. as described in TS 24.008 [6]). The MSC Server shall also control a CS-MGW using the Mc reference point to perform the necessary interworking between RTP bearers on the Mb reference point and CS access bearers and adds the User Location Information (e.g. CGI or SAI) and/or UE Time Zone Information to the response to the session initiation.\nThe SCC AS selects to breakout an incoming session to the CS domain in case UE is registered in IMS as being attached to the CS network at an MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC. In this case, terminating iFC forwards the call to the SCC AS.\nFigure H.5.2.5-1: Terminating session via CS Access for inbound roamer\n1.\tThe UE A originates a call in the CS domain to party-B according to standard origination procedures.\n2.\tThe GMSC sends a Send Routing Information (SRI) request to the HLR.\n3.-4.\tThe HLR fetches a MSRN from the ICS-IWF acting as VLR by a Provide Roaming Number (PRN) request/response sequence.\n5.\tThe HLR forward the MSRN in the SRI Res. message.\n6.\tThe GMSC sets up the call towards the MGCF of the VPLMN with the received MSRN.\n7.\tThe MGCF initiates an INVITE towards the I‑CSCF in the visited IMS of the UE B.\n8.-9.\tThe I-CSCF retrieves the address assigned to the SeDoC user from the ICS-IWF. For the LIR the I-CSCF uses the called party from the INVITE which is the MSRN. The IWF has assigned this MSRN according to the called user (MSISDN) (step 3,4) and has stored the relation MSISDN/MSRN.\n10.\tThe I‑CSCF routes the INVITE to the S‑CSCF.\n11.\tThe S‑CSCF performs standard service control execution procedures. Filter criteria direct the S‑CSCF to send the INVITE to the SCC AS.\n12.\t. The SCC AS performs terminating access domain selection. The SCC AS chooses the CS access network and the MSC Server contact address, amongst the registered contact addresses for the UE B, for the setup of the media. The SCC AS establishes a new session by sending an INVITE to the UE B via the S‑CSCF.\n13.\tThe S‑CSCF forwards the INVITE to the MSC Server based on the contact address stored during registration, using standard IMS procedures.\n14.\tThe MSC Server sends a Setup message to the UE B.\nH.5.3\tOutbound-roaming support\nH.5.3.1\tCall flows for outbound-roamers\nH.5.3.1.1\tAttach/Registration Procedure for outbound roamer\nFigure H.5.3.1.1-1: Authentication/Registration for outbound roamer in a SeDoC enhanced network\n1.-22.\tThe flow description is the same as in annex XXX of this specification.\nH.5.3.1.2\tOriginating session for own users roaming (outbound roamer)\nFor session origination for own users please refer to clause 7.3.2.1.2 of this specification.\nH.5.3.1.3\tTerminating session for own users roaming (outbound roamer)\nFor session termination for own users please refer to clause 7.4.2.1.2 of this specification.\nH.5.3.1.4\tCall flow for outbound-roamers to a not enhanced network\nThe ICS-IWF acts as a HLR towards the not enhanced MSC in the VPLMN, the procedures between MSC and ICS-IWF follow the normal VLR - HLR procedures.\nNOTE:\tThe interaction between ICS-IWF and HSS is implementation specific.\nFigure H.5.3.2-1: Authentication/Registration for outbound roamer in a not enhanced network\n1.\tThe UE sends a Location Update Request message to the MSC-Server in the VPLMN and includes its IMSI and the LAI. In case of a combined attach, or CSFB etc., then the Location Update Request may be sent from the MME or the SGSN of the VPLMN.\n2.\tThe MSC detects based on the IMSI that the UE does not belong to the own network and is an inbound roamer. If the request is coming from the MME/SGSN, then the CS authentication may be skipped. The MSC contacts the ICS IWF, acting as a HLR of the HPLMN, indicating that CS authentication is required with a Authentication Parameter Request.\n3.\tThe ICS IWF retrieves the CS authentication data from the HSS.\n4.\tThe ICS IWF (acting as HLR to the MSC-Server) provides the Authentication Info parameters to the MSC-Server. The MSC-Server stores the parameters and triggers the CS authentication procedure.\n5.\tThe MSC-Server sends a Authentication Request with the RAND value to the UE.\n6.\tThe UE computes the SRES and provides it back to the MSC-Server in the Authentication Response.\n7.\tThe MSC-Server sends an Update Location Request with the IMSI and MSRN to the ICS-IWF, acting as the HLR of the HPLMN.\n8.\tThe ICS IWF retrieves the subscription profile and service settings from the HSS and maps them into a CS profile with CS settings.\n9.\tThe ICS IWF replies with the Insert Subscriber Data message according to normal VLR-HLR procedures.\n10.\tThe MSC Server starts ciphering according to normal procedures.\n11.\tThe MSC-Server provides a Location Update Accept message to the UE (or MME,SGSN if originated request comes from here) according to the normal procedures.\n12.\tThe MSC-Server exchanges the Subscriber Data Insert Acknowledgement and Location Update Acknowledgement according to normal VLR-HLR procedures.\nAnnex I (informative):Change history\nChange history\nDate\nMeeting\nTDoc\nCR\nRev\nCat\nSubject/Comment\nNew version\n2010-03\nSP-47\nSP-100161\n0142\n1\nB\nSupport for
