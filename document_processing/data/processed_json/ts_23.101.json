The infrastructure is a shared resource that provides services to all authorised end users within its coverage area.\nThe reference point between the user equipment domain and the infrastructure domain is termed the \"Uu\" reference point (UMTS radio interface).\nNOTE:\tThe description assumes an access interface based on UTRA.

The user equipment may include a removable smart card that may be used in different user equipment types. The user equipment is further sub-divided in to the Mobile Equipment Domain (ME) and the User Services Identity Module Domain (USIM).\nThe reference point between the ME and the USIM is termed the \"Cu\" reference point.\nFor the purpose of UMTS Cellular networks the following definition applies:\nUser Equipment is a device allowing a user access to network services. For the purpose of 3GPP specifications the interface between the UE and the network is the radio interface. A User Equipment can be subdivided into a number of domains, the domains being separated by reference points. Currently defined domains are the USIM and ME Domains. The ME Domain can further be subdivided into several components showing the connectivity between multiple functional groups. These groups can be implemented in one or more hardware devices. An example of such a connectivity is the TE - MT interface. Further, an occurrence of User Equipment is an MS for GSM as defined in TS 24.002 [3].\nThe figure below shows the Functional Model for the User Equipment, UE.\nFigure 1a: Functional Model for the User Equipment\nThe 07- and 27-series refer to physical instances of this Functional Model. The figure below shows an example of a physical configuration as it could be used in these specifications. The boxes, in this figure, refer to physical elements.

This split allows for different approaches for the Core Network Domain, each approach specifying distinct types of Core Networks connectable to the Access Network Domain, as well as different access techniques, each type of Access Network connectable to the Core Network Domain.\nThe reference point between the access network domain and the core network domain is termed the \"Iu\" reference point.\nNOTE:\tThe split into the User Equipment Domain, the Access Network Domain and the Core Network Domain is consistent with the GMM report.",

The Home Stratum only involves domains from figure 2, the Application Stratum only involves domains from figure 3.

E.g. the USIM-Home Network flows are transparently transported through USIM-MT, MT-Access Network, Access Network-Serving Network and Serving Network-Home Network interfaces, and relayed without interpretation by MT, Access Network and Serving Network domains.\nThe dotted lines indicates that the protocol used is not specific to UMTS, in some cases different protocols are possible.
