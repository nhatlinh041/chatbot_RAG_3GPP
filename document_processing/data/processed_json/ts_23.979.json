Figure 5.1 below illustrates how the PoC service elements fit into the IMS architecture.\nFigure 5-1: PoC service elements in the IMS architecture\nNOTE:\tThe I-CSCF is not shown in figure 5-1 for the sake of simplicity. Application servers (XDMS, PoC Server, Presence Server), and interfaces between these application servers shown within the dotted box in figure 5-1 are defined by OMA.\nThe OMA PoC architecture specification [6] leverages IMS as the underlying SIP-based IP-core network. To understand the details of how IMS capabilities relate to the overall PoC architecture, there is a need to map the reference points defined in the OMA PoC specification [6], and the reference points defined in TS 23.002 [3] and TS 23.228 [4].\nThe PoC server implementing the application level network functionality for the PoC service is essentially seen as an Application Server from the IMS perspective. Consequently, communications between the IMS core and the PoC server utilize the ISC interface defined in TS 23.228 [4].\nAs defined by OMA PoC AD [6], the XML Document Management Server (XDMS) is used by the PoC users to manage groups and lists (e.g. contact and access lists) that are needed for the PoC service. In the IMS architecture, the Ut interface provides these functions, hence communications between the XDMS and the UE utilize the Ut interface.\nAs defined by OMA PoC AD [6], a Presence Server may provide availability information about PoC users to other PoC users. The3GPP Presence architecture and the Presence Server are defined in TS 23.141 [5].",

      "content": "As described in OMA-AD_PoC [6] architecture document, there are two mechanisms for session establishment signalling supported. In both scenarios, the session is first established between the PoC user (originating or terminating) and the PoC server serving the user and then the other party is invited to the session. User preferences on how the handled PoC sessions may require special user level interactions are described in the OMA_RD PoC [7] and OMA_AD_PoC [6], but the general principle of the session flows is not affected by such interactions.\nThe mechanisms for session set-up as defined by OMA are described in the following clauses in more detail, i.e. those would require changes if changes are performed in the OMA specifications. These procedures have the following functional description of behaviour:\n1.\tOn-Demand Session:\nThe On Demand session provides a mechanism to negotiate media parameters such as IP address, ports and codecs, which are used for sending the media and floor control packets between the PoC Client and the home PoC Server when the user wants to actually establish a PoC session. This mechanism allows the PoC Client to invite, via PoC server(s), other PoC clients or receive PoC sessions by using the full session establishment procedure each time the user wants to establish/receive/join a PoC session. Media parameters may be negotiated again in this mechanism.\n2.\tPre-established Session:\nThe pre-established session provides a mechanism to negotiate media parameters such as IP address, ports and codecs, which are used for sending the media and floor control packets between the PoC Client and the home PoC Server before establishing the PoC session. This mechanism allows the PoC Client to invite other PoC clients or receive PoC sessions without negotiating again the media parameters. After the pre-established session has been set up (once the PoC user has registered), the PoC Client is able to activate media bearer whenever needed:\n-\timmediately after the general PoC session pre-establishment procedure or;\n-\twhen the actual SIP signalling for the PoC media session establishment is initiated.",

      "content": "The TR describes the architectural requirements to support the OMA POC services in clause 4 and the impacts to the architectural concepts in clause 5. This Clause 5 addresses the impacts to the signalling plane by describing the on-demand and pre-established sessions. Also the impacts to the User Plane are described as well.\nThe concept of Service Based Local Policies (SBLP) and the Go interface as described in TS 23.228 [4] and TS 23.207 [9] supports the OMA PoC signalling requirements for session establishment, however it is not mandated that these capabilities are to be used for the OMA PoC session establishment.\nPoC will contain the same GPRS/PDP contexts usage options as for any IMS service, i.e. the options also apply for PoC. However, it is not only up to the PoC client to chose any of the GPRS/PDP contexts usage options as the valid options depends on possible restrictions, e.g. whether the GGSN apply restrictions on the PDP context used for IMS signalling as specified in TS 23.228 [4].\nAnnex A describes the recommended QoS Attribute settings and the Radio Network Configurations to support OMA PoC services.\nThe main issue in supporting PoC services is the session establishment delays. Annex B contains the analysis of the delay for the PoC session establishments based on 'on demand' signalling and based on 'pre-established session' signalling.\nAnnex C describes the analyses of the required SigComp performance and gives requirements to support the PoC service. This analysis concludes that IMS provides sufficient SigComp support for the OMA PoC delay requirements.\nThe PoC codecs are specified within 3GPP SA4.\nIt is concluded that the current 3GPP IMS specifications supports the requirements to deploy PoC services as defined by OMA.\nAnnex A:Recommended QoS settings and configuration parameters for PoC\nA.1\tIntroduction\nThe Push-to-Talk over Cellular (PoC) application is to be run over PS Domain bearers. The application is characterized by half-duplex voice communication.\nThe Annex makes recommendations on QoS attribute settings and radio network configurations.\nA.2\tQoS attribute settings\nThe following clauses describe recommended QoS settings by the UE during PDP context activation and modification procedures for the media flow in PoC with only one general purpose PDP context (clause A.2.1) and when separate PDP contexts are used for the media and signalling (clause A.2.2).\nThe bandwidth needed for the media flow in PoC is to a large extent dependent on the negotiated speech codec bit rate together with the transport format. In the following it is assumed that AMR speech coding, TS 26.071 [11], together with the RTP payload format for AMR, RFC 3267 [12], is used in the 'octet-aligned mode', without interleaving and without CRCs. It is furthermore assumed that one RTP packet carries ten (10) AMR frames, corresponding to 10*20 ms of speech (ptime=200). Note that also other packetization schemes are possible. Table A.2-1 shows the required bandwidth for the RTP flow on 'IP level' (i.e. including RTP/UDP/IP overhead) for the different AMR modes:\nTable A.2-1: Required bandwidth Uplink/Downlink for the RTP traffic for different AMR modes (ptime=200)\nAMR Mode\nRequired bandwidth when IPv4 is used [bits/s] [Note]\nRequired bandwidth when IPv6 is used [bits/s]\nAMR 4.75\n6840\n7640\nAMR 5.15\n7240\n8040\nAMR 5.9\n8040\n8840\nAMR 6.7\n8840\n9640\nAMR 7.4\n9640\n10440\nAMR 7.95\n10040\n10840\nAMR 10.2\n12440\n13240\nAMR 12.2\n14440\n15240\nNOTE:\tFor the usage of IP version in IMS see TS 23.221 [13], clause 5.1.\nA.2.1\tQoS attribute settings for general purpose PDP context\nIf one general purpose PDP context is used for both media and signalling, the PDP context should be of traffic class Interactive.\nThe following QoS parameter values for such PDP context are recommended to be requested by the UE.\nTable A.2.1-1: Recommended QoS attribute settings for a single general purpose PDP Context for both the PoC control plane and user plane traffic\nTraffic class\nInteractive class\nNotes\nMaximum bitrate (kbps)\nSee 'Notes'\nThe value for this parameter is based on the highest speech codec rate negotiated via SDP in the codec mode-set (see table A.2-1) plus appropriate bandwidth for the SIP Signalling traffic to QoS limit the impact on the media flow.\nDelivery order\nNo\nIn sequence delivery of voice samples is not required nor is it desirable since it creates jitter in the media channel. An RTP jitter buffer in the client should re-order packets if needed.\nMaximum SDU size (octets)\n1500\nMaximum size of IP packets.

This includes the RRC Connection Setup procedure, the Service Request procedure and the Security Mode Command procedure.\nThe major delay comes from the RRC connection setup procedure, which includes the Random Access procedure, the RL setup procedure and the RB setup procedure.\n🡪 The estimated delay is about [700ms~1500ms].\n(2)\tEstablish Radio Access Bearer (RAB) in the UE-A side\nRAB should be established for the existing PDP context through which the SIP INVITE message is transmitted by the UE-A. This includes the RAB assignment procedure and the Radio Link (RL) reconfiguration procedure and the Radio Bearer (RB) setup procedure.\n🡪 The estimated delay is about [700ms~1500ms].\n(3)\tSIP signalling transfer delay\nWhen the user plan is ready to send the INVITE message, the UE-A sends it to PoC AS, and then it forwards the INVITE message to PS Domain of UE-B.\n🡪 The estimated delay is less than [500ms].\n(4)\tSet up of Signalling Connection in the UE-B side\nWhen the target SGSN receives the INVITE message, the SGSN shall establish a signalling connection in order to send the NAS signalling message to UE. This includes the Paging procedure, the RRC Connection Setup procedure, the Service Request procedure, and the Security Mode Command procedure.\nThe major delay comes from the Paging procedure and the RRC Connection Setup procedure.\n🡪 The estimated delay is about [700ms~1500ms].\n(5)\tSet up of RAB in the UE-B side\nThe terminating SGSN initiates the RAB Assignment procedure for the PDP Context for the IMS signalling in order to transmit the SIP INVITE message to the UE-B.\nThe major delay comes from the RAB assignment procedure which includes the RL reconfiguration procedure and the RB setup procedure.\n🡪 The estimated delay is about [700ms~1500ms].\n(6)\tSignalling transfer delay\nThe UE-B sends a SIP response message to the PoC AS (B). PoC AS (B) forwards the message to the PoC AS (A) and then the PoC AS (A) sends Talk Burst Confirm to the UE-A and Receiving Talk Burst to the UE-B.\n🡪 The estimated delay is less than [500ms].\nTherefore, the total estimated delay for the PoC session establishment (the time when the User-A initiates the PoC session ~ the time when the User-A can start to speak) is about [3800ms~7000ms].\nB.3\tOn demand session with automatic answer\nFigure B.2 shows the delay components in case of the session establishment based on 'on demand session with automatic answer' signalling.\nFigure B.2: Delay component for the case of on demand session with automatic answer\n(1)\tSet up of Signalling Connection in the UE-A side\nWhen the User-A initiates a PoC Session, the UE-A shall establish the signalling connection in order to send the NAS signalling. This includes the RRC Connection Setup procedure, the Service Request procedure and the Security Mode Command procedure.\nThis step is the same as that of the session establishment based on 'on demand session with manual answer'.\n🡪 The estimated delay is about [700ms~1500ms].\n(2)\tEstablish Radio Access Bearer (RAB) in the UE-A side\nRAB should be established for the existing PDP context through which the SIP INVITE message can be transmitted by the UE-A. This includes the RAB assignment procedure and the RL reconfiguration procedure and the RB setup procedure.\n🡪 The estimated delay is about [700ms~1500ms].\n(3)\tSIP signalling transfer delay (Part I)\nWhen the user plan is ready to send INVITE message, the UE-A sends the message to the PoC AS (A) and then PoC AS (A) forwards the message to the PoC AS (B).\n🡪 The estimated delay is less than [500ms]\n(4)\tSIP signalling transfer delay (Part II)\nFor the Auto-answer mode, when PoC AS (B) receives the INVITE message, the PoC AS (B) sends the AUTO-ANSWER message to the PoC AS (A) without waiting for the response from the UE (B). The PoC AS (A) can send the Talk burst confirm to the UE-A when it receives AUTO-ANSWER message from the PoC AS (B).\n🡪 The estimated delay is less than [500ms]\nTherefore, the total estimated delay for the PoC session establishment (the time when the User-A initiates the PoC session ~ the time when the User-A can start to speak) is about [2400ms~4000ms].\nNote that the delay of the session establishment using 'on demand session with automatic answer' can be about 2000ms (2 sec) smaller than that of the session establishment using 'on demand session with manual answer'.\nB.4\tOn pre-established session\nFigure B.3 shows the delay components in case of the session establishment based on 'pre-established session' signalling.\nFigure B.3: Delay component for the case of pre-established session\n(1)\tSet up of Signalling Connection in the UE-A side\nWhen the User-A initiates a PoC Session, the UE-A shall establish the signalling connection in order to send the NAS signalling. This includes the RRC Connection Setup procedure, the Service Request procedure and the Security Mode Command procedure.\nThis step is the same as that of the session establishment based on 'on demand session'.\n🡪 The estimated delay is about [700ms~1500ms].\n(2)\tSet up of RAB in the UE-A side\nRAB should be established for the existing PDP context through which the SIP REFER message is transmitted by the UE-A.\nThis step is the same as that of the session establishment based on 'on demand session'.\n🡪 The estimated delay is about [700ms~1500ms].\n(3)\tSIP signalling transfer delay (Part I)\nWhen the user plan is ready to send the REFER message, the UE-A sends the message to the PoC AS (A) and then PoC AS (A) sends the INVITE message to the PoC AS (B).\n🡪 The estimated delay is less than [500ms].\n(4)\tSIP signalling transfer delay (Part II)\nWhen it receives the INVITE message, the PoC AS (B) sends the AUTO-ANSWER message to the PoC AS (A) without waiting for the response from the UE-B. It is possible because a 'pre-established session' has been set up beforehand. The PoC AS (A) sends the Talk burst confirm to the UE-A when it receives the AUTO-ANSWER message from the PoC AS (B).\n🡪 The estimated delay is less than [500ms].\nTherefore, the total estimated delay for the PoC session establishment (the time when the User-A initiates a PoC session ~ the time when the User-A can start to speak) is about [2400ms~4000ms].\nNote that the delay of the session establishment using 'pre-established session' is almost the same as that of the session establishment of 'on demand session with automatic answer'.\nAnnex C:Required SigComp performance\nC.1\tIntroduction\nIt is recognized that the SIP signalling transfer delay is dependent on:\n-\tSize of the messages sent over the radio link, which is dependent on the performance of the signalling compression algorithm (SigComp, RFC 3320 [14]).\n-\tAvailable bandwidth over the radio link for signalling, which is dependent on the maximum bit rate attribute settings for the PDP Context used for the PoC control plane traffic.\nThis annex contains the analysis of required SigComp performance in order to meet the delay budget for SIP signalling transfer delay presented in Annex B.\nC.2\tAssumptions\nThe following assumptions have been used:\n-\tThe on demand session using automatic answer is used and the inviting PoC User is given an early \"right-to-speak\" indication as described in clause 5.3.2.2 and clause B.2.\n-\tA typical SIP INVITE message in an OMA PoC implementation will have approximately the same size as the SIP INVITE message described as message 1 in clause 7.2.2.1 in TS 24.228 [15]. The size of the referred SIP INVITE is 1375 bytes not including UDP (or TCP) and IP overhead, therefore for OMA PoC it is assumed that a SIP INVITE message will be in the order of 1400 bytes including UDP (or TCP) and IP overhead.\n-\tA typical SIP 200 OK message in an OMA PoC implementation will have approximately the same size as the SIP 200 OK message described as message 18 in clause 7.2.2.1 in TS 24.228 [15]. Therefore for OMA PoC it is assumed that a SIP 200 OK message will be in the order of 800 bytes including UDP (or TCP) and IP overhead.\n-\tA SIP 100 Trying message must be sent over the radio link as acknowledgement of the SIP INVITE message. The size of the SIP 100 Trying is 300 bytes including UDP (or TCP) and IP overhead.\n-\tThe talk burst confirm message is assumed to be 40 bytes including IP and UDP overhead.\n-\tThe processing time in the UE to produce and compress a SIP message is 50 ms.\n-\tThe delays imposed by all involved core network elements, including the core network of the radio access network (i.e. SGSN and GGSN) in a message transfer (IMS Core and PoC AS) are 100 ms.\n-\tThe duration between the times the inviting PoC User initiates the PoC session and when he receives a \"right-to-speak\" indication should be less than 2.0 seconds, as required in OMA_RD PoC [7].\n-\tAll lower estimated delay values presented in clause B.2 apply.\nC.3\tEstimation of SIP compression ratios\nThe duration between the times the inviting PoC User initiates the PoC session and when he receives a \"right-to-speak\" indication shall be less than 2.0 seconds (2000 ms) according to OMA_RD PoC [7]. It is assumed that all lower estimated delay values presented in clause B.2 applies. This means that a total delay budget of less than 2000 ms –700 ms – 700 ms = 600 ms is assumed for the SIP signalling transfer delay (delay components (3) and (4)).\nTable C.3-1 presents the delay budget given the assumptions presented in C.2.\nTable C.3-1: Detailed description of the delay budget for SIP signalling transfer delay\nAction\nDelay\nDescription\nThe PoC Client produce and compress a SIP INVITE message\n50 ms\nThe PoC Client transmit the SIP INVITE message to the PoC AS:\n*Radio transport delay of SIP INVITE + 100 ms\n*Radio transport delay of SIP INVITE = (SIP message size * Compression ratio) / Bit rate of radio link\nThe IMS Core sends a SIP 100 Trying to acknowledge the reception of the SIP INVITE\n**Radio transport delay of SIP 100 Trying\n**Radio transport delay of SIP 100 Trying = (SIP message size * Compression ratio) / Bit rate of radio link\nThe PoC AS transmits the SIP 200 OK message to the PoC Client:\n100 ms + ***Radio transport delay of SIP 200OK\n***Radio transport delay of SIP 200OK = (SIP message size * Compression ratio) / Bit rate of radio link\nThe PoC AS transmits a talk burst confirmed message to the PoC Client:\n****Radio transport delay of talk burst confirmed message\n****Radio transport delay of talk burst confirmed message = (talk burst confirmed message size) / Bit rate of radio link\nTotal SIP signalling transfer delay:\n50 ms + 100 ms + 100 ms + Radio transport delay of SIP INVITE + Radio transport delay of SIP 100 Trying + Radio transport delay of SIP 200OK + Radio transport delay of talk burst confirmed message < 600 ms\nThe compression ratios of table C.3-2 is calculated by using the expression for the total SIP signalling transfer delay in table C.3-1, and assuming a bit rate of the radio link used for the PoC control plane traffic\nTable C.3-2: Compression ratio as a function of Bit rate of the radio link\nBit rate of radio link\nCompression ratio\n8 kbps\n> 8.06:1\n16 kbps\n> 3.79:1\n32 kbps\n> 1.84:1\n64 kbps\n> 0.91:1\nC.4\tSigComp requirements\nGiven that a low bit rate PS bearer (throughput < 16 kbps) is used for the PoC control plane traffic, SIP signalling compression ratios typically larger than 3:1 is needed to meet the delay requirement stated in OMA_RD PoC [7]. Therefore it can be concluded that:\n-\tThe decompression byte code should be stored as a state and should not be sent from the transmitting node to the receiving node in every SigComp message. This implies that a SigComp implementation used for PoC should have a state memory size (SMS, see RFC 3320 [14]) larger than zero.\n-\tAn SMS that is larger than zero enables stateful compression, which probably is needed to obtain sufficient SIP signalling compression efficiency.\n-\tThe initial creation of the SigComp compartment (see RFC 3320 [14]) is done during IMS registration. The exchange and storing of the decompression byte codes is recommended to be performed during the non time critical SIP message exchange of the IMS Registration. This enables the transmission of compressed SIP messages without the overhead of decompression byte codes even in the first PoC Session after IMS Registration. However, the receiver of the byte codes cannot assume that the byte codes are sent only during the IMS registration.\nThe IMS support for SigComp is specified in TS 24.229 [16], which fulfils the requirements as stated above. Consequently, IMS provides sufficient SigComp support to fulfil the OMA delay requirements.\nAnnex D:Change history\nChange history\nDate\nMeeting\nTDoc\nCR\nRev\nCat\nSubject/Comment\nNew version\n2004-12\nSA#26\nSP-040749\n-\n-\n-\nCreation of version 6.0.0\n6.0.0\n2005-03\nSA#27\nSP-050160\n0001\n3\n-\nImpact on Charging Correlation\n6.1.0\n2005-03\nSA#27\nSP-050160\n0002\n1\n-\nQoS of pre-established PDP context\n6.1.0\n2005-03\nSA#27\nSP-050160\n0003\n1\n-\nAlignment of 23.979 with OMA architecture\n6.1.0\n2005-06\nSA#28\nSP-050343\n0004\n1\n-\nCorrection of OMA PoC references\n6.2.0\n2007-06\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-7 version\n7.0.0\n2008-12\nSP-42\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-8 version\n8.0.0\n2009-12\nSP-46\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-9 version\n9.0.0\n2011-03\nSP-51\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-10 version (MCC)\n10.0.0\n2012-09\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-11 version (MCC)\n11.0.0\n2014-09\nSP-65\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-12 version (MCC)\n12.0.0\n2015-12\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-13 version (MCC)\n13.0.0\n2017-03\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-14 version (MCC)\n14.0.0\n2018-06\nSP-80\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-15 version (MCC)\n15.0.0\n2020-07\nSP-88E\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-16 version (MCC)\n16.0.0\n2022-03\nSP-95E\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-17 version (MCC)\n17.0.0\n2024-03\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-18 version (MCC)\n18.0.0",
