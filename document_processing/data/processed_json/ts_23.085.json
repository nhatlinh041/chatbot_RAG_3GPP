CUG calls are rejected if they do not meet the criteria of these checks.\nCUG call: CUG call, in signalling terms, is a call where CUG information is passed from the originating switching entity to the destination entity.\nCUG Index: Code used to select a CUG for an outgoing call, or to indicate an incoming CUG call. Indices are passed between the user and the network and have significance only within the context of a users subscription.\nCUG Interlock Code: Code which uniquely identifies a CUG within a network. The Interlock code is passed from the point of origin to the destination in a CUG call to identify the CUG which has been invoked.\nCUG Related Call Barring: CUG related call barring is call barring applied to a CUG subscriber by the home network when roaming in a non-CUG network. The user is unable to remove CUG related call barring.\nExplicit CUG Invocation: Explicit CUG invocation is where a calling user attempts to invoke a CUG by passing CUG information to the network in a call request.\nImplicit CUG Invocation: Implicit CUG invocation is where the user invokes some default characteristic of a CUG without providing any CUG information in the call request.\nNormal Call: Normal call in the context of this CUG TS is a call established from a CUG subscriber where no CUG information is passed from the originating switching entity to the destination entity.\nOutgoing Access Indicator: Indication passed from the point of origin to the destination in a CUG call to indicate that the calling user has subscribed to the Outgoing Access inter-CUG accessibility subscription option.",

See figure 1.1.\nLocation: VLR.\nThe purpose of this function is to check the provisioning of CUG against the requested Basic Service, perform an Index to Interlock conversion where an Index is provided, check whether O/G calls are barred within the CUG, deal with preferential CUGs, OA and any CUG related suppression indicators.\nThe call request may contain either no CUG information or combinations of the following CUG parameters: CUG Index, Suppress Outgoing Access indicator, Suppress Preferential CUG indicator.\nOn successful authorisation the call is established with one of the following: no CUG information, CUG Interlock Code, CUG Interlock Code and Outgoing Access indicator. If a CUG is implicitly invoked the VLR may optionally provide the related CUG Index as an indication to the calling user.\nOn unsuccessful authorisation the call is rejected and a rejection reason given.\nTable 1.3 specifies the VLRs response to CUG related call establishment requests.\nTable 1.3: MO CUG Call Authorisation Function (VLR)\n┌───────────╥──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐│  Calling  ║    Information provided by calling user          ││   user    ╟────────┬──────────┬─────────┬─────────┬──────────┤│ subscrip. ║ No CUG │CUG Index │Suppress │Suppress │ CI+SOA   ││ for Basic ║  Info. │  (CI)    │   OA    │Pref CUG │  or CI+  ││  Service  ║        │or CI+SPC │  (SOA)  │  (SPC)  │ SOA+SPC  │╞═══════════╬════════╪══════════╪═════════╪═════════╪══════════╡│CUG without║ Reject │Interlock │ Reject  │ Reject  │Interlock ││ Pref CUG. ║        │          │         │         │          ││   No OA   ║ note 1 │note 2,3,4│ note 1  │ note 1  │note 2,3,4│├───────────╫────────┼──────────┼─────────┼─────────┼──────────┤│ CUG with  ║        │Interlock │         │ Reject  │Interlock ││ Pref CUG. ║IC(pref)│          │IC(pref) │         │          ││   No OA   ║        │note 2,3,4│         │ note 1  │note 2,3,4│├───────────╫────────┼──────────┼─────────┼─────────┼──────────┤│CUG with OA║ Normal │  IC+OA   │ Reject  │ Normal  │Interlock ││and without║  call  │          │         │  call   │          ││ Pref CUG  ║        │note 3,4,5│ note 1  │         │note 2,3,4│├───────────╫────────┼──────────┼─────────┼─────────┼──────────┤│ CUG with  ║IC(pref)│  IC+OA   │         │ Normal  │Interlock ││ Pref CUG  ║  +OA   │          │IC(pref) │  call   │          ││and with OA║        │note 3,4,5│         │         │note 2,3,4│├───────────╫────────┼──────────┼─────────┼─────────┼──────────┤│  Normal   ║ Normal │ Normal   │ Normal  │ Normal  │ Normal   ││subscriber ║  call  │  call    │  call   │  call   │  call    │└───────────╨────────┴──────────┴─────────┴─────────┴──────────┘\nNOTE 1:\t\"Inconsistent access information - no CUG selected\".\nNOTE 2:\tIf the intra-CUG restriction option \"Outgoing calls barred within the CUG\" is applicable for the requested CUG, the call shall be rejected, reason for rejection \"Outgoing calls barred within the CUG\".\nNOTE 3:\tIf an index is provided which is not recognised by the network the call is rejected, reason for rejection \"Unknown CUG Index\".\nNOTE 4:\tIf an index is provided which does not match with the interlock(s) of the requested basic service the call is rejected, reason for rejection \"Inconsistent access information - Index incompatible with requested basic service\".\nNOTE 5:\tIf a CUG is selected using a CUG Index but the intra-CUG restriction option \"Outgoing calls barred within the CUG\" is applicable, and the calling user subscription includes OA for the requested Basic Service the call shall be attempted as a normal call with no CUG information included in the call establishment signalling.\nAn SDL indicating when the authorisation function is invoked in the VLR is shown in figure 1.1.

See figure 1.2.\nLocation: HLR.\nThe purpose of this function is to identify a match between calling and called party CUG attributes for a given basic service, whilst enforcing intra-CUG communication restrictions. If no match is obtained the call is rejected.\nThe calling party CUG attributes may be either a CUG Interlock Code or a CUG Interlock Code and Outgoing Access indicator.\nTable 1.4 indicates the HLRs response to incoming CUG calls, or incoming calls to CUG subscribers.\nOn successful authorisation the call establishment is continued using one of the following: no CUG information, CUG Interlock Code, Interlock Code and Outgoing Access indicator.\nOn unsuccessful authorisation the call is rejected and a rejection reason given.\nTable 1.4: MT CUG Call Authorisation Function (HLR)\n┌─────────┬─────╥────────────────────────────────────────────┐│         │     ║ Called party subscription for Basic Service││ Calling │     ╟─────────────────────────────────────┬──────┤│  Party  │Inter║            CUG subscriber           │      ││   CUG   │-lock╟──────────────────┬──────────────────┤Normal││ Infor-  │check║       No IA      │        IA        │ subs.││ mation  │     ╟─────────┬────────┼─────────┬────────┤      ││         │     ║ No ICB  │  ICB   │ No ICB  │  ICB   │      │╞═════════╪═════╬═════════╪════════╪═════════╪════════╪══════╡│         │Match║Interlock│ Reject │Interlock│ Reject │      ││Interlock│     ║  Code   │ note 1 │  Code   │ note 1 │Reject││  Code   ├─────╫─────────┴────────┼─────────┴────────┤      ││  (IC)   │ No  ║      Reject      │      Reject      │note 2││         │Match║      note 2      │      note 2      │      │├─────────┼─────╫─────────┬────────┼─────────┬────────┼──────┤│Interlock│Match║  IC+OA  │ Reject │  IC+OA  │ IC+OA  │      ││+Outgoing│     ║         │ note 1 │         │        │      ││ Access  ├─────╫─────────┴────────┼─────────┴────────┤ IC+OA││ (IC+OA) │ No  ║      Reject      │       IC+OA      │      ││         │Match║      note 2      │                  │      │├─────────┼─────╫──────────────────┼──────────────────┼──────┤│ No CUG  │  -  ║      Reject      │   Normal call    │Normal││  Info.  │     ║  note 3 and 4    │                  │ call │└─────────┴─────╨──────────────────┴──────────────────┴──────┘\nNotes on reasons for rejections:\nNOTE 1:\t\"Incoming calls barred within the CUG\".\nNOTE 2:\t\"Interlock mismatch\".\nNOTE 3:\t\"Requested basic service violates CUG constraints\" A non-CUG call has invoked (via a particular basic service) a CUG which does not have an Incoming Access capability.\nNOTE 4:\tSee clause 1.6.\nAn SDL indicating when the function is invoked in the HLR is shown in figure 1.2.
