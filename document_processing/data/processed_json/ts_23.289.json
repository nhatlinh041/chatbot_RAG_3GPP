The architectural figures in this clause are aligned  with the 5GS architecture for MBS shown in Figure 5.1-2 of 3GPP TS 23.247 [15], which identifies both mandatory and optional functional entities and interfaces, in reference point representation, available for use by the MC services.\nMulticast and broadcast communication services in 5G for MC group communications rely on the creation and establishment of MBS sessions to deliver user data in downlink. Shared and individual delivery from the MC service server to multiple MC users (i.e., users affiliated to a certain MC group) is supported either as point-to-point or point-to-multipoint over the radio. The MBS sessions are either broadcast or multicast type and consist of one or multiple QoS flows for different service requirements. For the broadcast MBS session or local MBS session, the MBS service area is configured with the MBS session.\nNOTE 1:\tSupport of MBS and specific session types is an implementation choice.\nNOTE 2:\tAspects related to MC services over local MBS sessions and location dependent broadcast services are considered according to 3GPP TS 23.247 [15] clause 6.2 and clause 7.3.4, respectively.\nWithin this arrangement, the MC service server decides whether to create broadcast or multicast MBS sessions to be associated with certain MC groups. The 5GC adaptively decides whether to deliver the MBS traffic from the MB-UPF in the form of shared delivery or individual delivery, where the latter is applicable to multicast MBS sessions only. The NG-RAN decides to utilize point-to-point or point-to-multipoint delivery methods applicable for shared delivery only. MBS provides reliability enhancements and minimizes loss of information, e.g., due to mobility and handover.\nMBS group scheduling mechanism enables simultaneous reception of MBS and unicast user traffic by the MC service UEs. The UEs can receive broadcast MBS sessions irrespective of their RRC state (i.e., connected, inactive or idle) and multicast sessions only in RRC‑CONNECTED and RRC-INACTIVE state.\nThe following capabilities (non-exhaustive list) provided by MBS could be used by MC service servers as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15]:\n-\tMBS session creation;\n-\tMBS session update;\n-\tMBS session release;\n-\tMBS session ID allocation;\n-\tTransparent MBS Data forwarding;\n-\tDynamic PCC control for MBS session;\n-\tUE's MBS assistance information provision.",

If concurrent sessions are used, the MC service server may utilize the capability of resource sharing specified in 3GPP TS 23.503 [8].\nFor the request of communication resources by the MC service server via N5 reference point or Rx reference point, or N33 reference point, the MC service client provides to the MC service server the corresponding communication resource details (e.g. IP addresses and ports) of the MC service client and the corresponding media anchoring points.\nThis procedure is generic to any type of session establishment with the MC service server requesting network resources.",

The MC service server may consider the UE's capabilities and service related information e.g., UE's MBS capabilities, location, MBS listening status report sent by group members when it decides to create or use MBS sessions. The MC service server needs to interact with the 5GC for this matter. During the interaction, the necessary information related to the requested session is determined, e.g., MBS session mode (either a broadcast or a multicast session) and the required QoS profile. This interaction depends on the configuration option under consideration, i.e., whether the MC service server is in trusted domain (limited operations), and whether the session creation is done with or without a dynamic PCC rule.\nNOTE 1:\tIt is implementation specific whether the MC service server decides to use multicast or broadcast MBS sessions.\nNOTE 2:\tIt is implementation specific whether the MC service server decides to create (one or multiple) MBS sessions for MC media for MC group communications associated to a certain MC group or create (one or multiple) dynamic MBS sessions once the need has emerged, e.g., dynamic MBS sessions to be associated for an ad hoc group.\nNOTE 3:\tIt is implementation specific whether an MBS session is associated to one or multiple MC groups, and whether it is re-assigned to other MC groups.\nNOTE 4:\tHow the MC service server uses the UE's capabilities and service related information in order to create and use the MBS session is implementation specific.\nThe information elements describing the MBS session under consideration is then sent to the MC service clients via MBS session announcement, where the latter need to react according to the announced session mode.\nIf eMBMS and 5G MBS co-exist for MC services, the MC service server may decide to trigger the establishment of an eMBMS bearer to deliver the MC media associated to the MC service group communications, if the target MC service group(s) consists of members with eMBMS capable UE.

The procedure starts once the MC service server initiates a TMGI allocation request (either directly to MB-SMF or indirectly via NEF). Upon the reception of the TMGI allocation response, the MC service server sends an MBS session creation request, including further information related to the MBS session, e.g., MBS session ID, MBS session mode and the QoS requirements if dynamic PCC rule is not considered. However, if dynamic PCC rule is considered, the MC service server defines these requirements at a later step, namely it sends an MBS authorization/policy create request towards PCF (either directly or to the NEF) indicating the QoS requirements.\nIn the case of an untrusted MC service server, when the requested MBS service area crosses several MB-SMF service areas, the TMGI allocation request is rejected by the NEF/MBSF and it guides the MC service server by dividing the requested MBS service area into groups as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15]. Hence, the MC service server initiates a new TMGI allocation request for each grouped MBS service area. If during MBS session creation request the 5GS discovers that requested MBS service area crosses several MB-SMF service areas, the request is rejected, and the NEF/MBSF guides the MC service server as described earlier. Hence, the MC service server initiates a new MBS session creation procedure for each grouped MBS service area. The MC service server may utilize a unicast session if any MBS service area is not supported by any MB-SMF.\nNOTE 1:\tIn case of LTE eMBMS and 5G MBS co-existence, the MC service server may trigger the establishment of eMBMS bearers as described in 3GPP TS 23.280 [3] (or it may establish a unicast bearer) based on the RAT capabilities supported by the affiliated members in the MC service group X. If MBSF and BM-SC are co-located, TMGI used by 4G eMBMS can be the same as the MBS session ID.\nNOTE 2:\tFor the case of multi carrier support for broadcast MBS sessions, the MC service server may indicate the frequencies within a broadcast MBS service area by providing the MBS frequency selection area ID(s) (MBS FSA ID(s)) to the MB-SMF, or indirectly, via NEF.\n2.\tThe MC service server provides the MC service clients affiliated to MC service group X with the information related to the created MBS session via the MBS session announcement.

The established session can either be in active or inactive state as indicated in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15]. The MC service clients sends a UE session join notification towards the server. If indicated in the MBS session announcement information, MC service clients report the monitoring state (i.e., the reception quality of the MBS session) back to the MC service server; or\n5b.\tFor broadcast MBS sessions, if the MC service client is accessing over 5G, the session is established as part of the session creation procedures as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15], and the network resources are reserved both in 5GC and NG-RAN.

      "content": "The MC service server can decide to configure an MBS session per MC service group to transmit the media related to the corresponding MC service group communications. Such group communications can comprise different service requirements. For that, multicast and broadcast MBS sessions need to be configured with multiple MBS QoS flows to address different service requirements, e.g., different required QoS, provided by the MC service server. For instance, application-level control messages or media associated to a group communication can comprise different QoS requirements. Also, different type of group communications can comprise different QoS requirements, e.g., emergency group calls should be handled with a higher priority than normal group calls.\nThe configuration of multiple MBS QoS flows to address different service requirements is associated to the assignment of different streams (e.g., different ports) within an MBS session.\nThe established multicast MBS session can either be in active or inactive state, where the former indicates the activation of radio resources hence transmitting the MC media to the associated MC service group, and the latter indicates their deactivation as no MC media is being transmitted. The MC service server may trigger the activation of multicast MBS sessions once the MC service group is established and active, as well as once the MC media is available for transmission. For this purpose, the MC service server sends a multicast MBS session activation request towards the 5GC indicating the MBS session ID to be activated.\nSimilar to the use of eMBMS, the MC service server shall provide the associated information between a specific group communication and the stream to be used within an MBS session. This information could be sent in advance in an MBS session announcement or could be provided on demand in an additional signalling message for the MBS session, e.g., MapGroupToSessionStream (similar to the MapGroupToBearer in eMBMS).",

      "content": "The procedure in figure 7.3.3.5.2-1 describes how media related to a specific group communication can be distributed over a configured MBS session which consist of multiple QoS flows, i.e. addressing different service requirements. The procedure is applicable for both the pre-created MBS session case as described in clause 7.3.3.1.2 and the dynamic MBS session case as described in clause 7.3.3.1.3. For simplicity, the figure 7.3.3.5.2-1 shows that the MBS session is pre-created prior to the group communication establishment.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tMC service clients 1 to n are attached to the 5GS, registered and affiliated to the same MC service group X.\n-\tThe MC service server has decided to use an MBS session for MC service group communications associated to MC service group X.\nFigure 7.3.3.5.2-1: MC service group media transmission over MBS sessions\n1.\tThe MC service server creates a multicast or a broadcast MBS session targeting group communications associated to MC service group X, as being specified in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15]. Therefore, the MC service server can provide default service requirements to be addressed by the MBS session, e.g. associated to MC 5QIs and specific allocation and retention priority (ARP) to transmit the media associated to MC service group communications.\nThe MBS session is announced and received by MC service client 2 to n. The MC service server has identified that MC service clients 2 to n can receive media over the MBS sessions, e.g. based on a notification from the MC service clients indicating the successful join of the multicast MBS session or a monitoring report of the broadcast MBS session (similar to the listening status report used for eMBMS).\n2.\tA new MC service group communication is established for the MC service group X consisting of a specific required QoS, e.g. an MC service emergency group communication. The group communication setup can be done over unicast.\n2a. For broadcast MBS sessions, the session is established upon sending a session start request as part of the MBS session creation procedure, which is described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15].\n2b. For multicast MBS session, the session is established upon the acceptance of the first UE session join request initiated from the MC service UE towards the 5GS, as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15]. The multicast session can then have either an active or an inactive state.\n3. \tThe MC service server may send a multicast MBS session activation request towards the 5GC in order to activate the multicast MBS session in case the session has an inactive state. For this purpose, the MC service server indicates the MBS session ID to be activated.\n4.\tConsidering that the established group communication requires a specific QoS, e.g. an MC service emergency group communication which requires higher priority (i.e. better ARP), the MC service server requests an MBS session update to the 5GS to provide the new required QoS, if not done during the MBS session creation in step 1. The MBS session should then be updated and an additional QoS flow may be configured.\n5.\tThe MC service server sends a MapGroupToSessionStream to MC service clients 2 to n over the configured MBS session providing the required stream information to receive the media related to the specific established MC service group communication within the MBS session.\n6.\tMC service clients process the MapGroupToSessionStream information to receive the related media over the specific MBS session stream.\n7.\tMC service client 1 sends media to the MC service server over unicast to be distributed for the established group communication.\n8.\tThe MC service server distributes the media to MC service clients 2 to n over the indicated stream within the established MBS session.\nNOTE:\tThe MC service server can stop the unicast delivery (if ongoing) towards the MC service clients considering the UE session join notification or the MBS listening status report.\n9.\tThe MC service server may send a multicast MBS session deactivation request towards the 5GC in order to deactivate the multicast MBS session. For this purpose, the MC service server indicates the MBS session ID to be deactivated.\n10.\tThe MC service server may further trigger the UE to leave multicast MBS session.",

Only one of the receiving MC service clients receiving the broadcast MBS session is shown.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe MC group communication is ongoing and the MC service media (e.g., DL media, application layer control signalling) is transmitted via broadcast MBS session in the broadcast service areas.\n2.\tThe MC service client is receiving the MC service media (e.g., DL media, application layer control signalling) via the unicast delivery.\n3.\tThe MC service client has already received the broadcast MBS session announcement, MapGroupToSessionStream information and enters the broadcast service area.\nFigure 7.3.3.8.2.2.2-1: Service continuity from unicast to broadcast.\n1.\tAn MC service group communication session is ongoing and the broadcast MBS session is used to deliver the MC service media of the group communication. The MC service client is receiving the MC service media via the unicast delivery.\n2.\tThe MC service client detects that it is able to receive the broadcast media due to e.g., moving into the broadcast service area of the announced MBS session ID. The MC service client may determine the broadcast reception quality by using the BLER of the received media. When no media is received, the quality estimation can consider the reference signals and the modulation and coding scheme (MCS).\n3.\tThe MC service client sends MBS listening status report which indicates the broadcast reception quality associated with the MBS session ID is sufficient to receive media. The MC service client may also map the determined broadcast reception quality to a broadcast reception quality level. The broadcast reception quality level indicates at which specific broadcast reception quality level the MC service media has been received.\nNOTE 1:\tThe set of MBS reception quality levels and the mapping of the determined broadcast reception quality to those levels are implementation.\nNOTE 2:\tIt is implementation that the broadcast reception quality level can be determined per MBS session, per media stream or per MBS QoS flow level via e.g., measurements of radio level signals, such as the reference signals from the NG-RAN node(s), or packet loss.\n4.\tBased on the MapGroupToSessionStream received before, the MC service client receives the DL MC service via both the broadcast MBS session and the unicast delivery.\nNOTE 3:\tIf any information about the broadcast MBS session stream has changed, the MC service server provides the MapGroupToSessionStream again.\n5.\tThe MC service server, based on the report from the participant, determines to stop sending the MC service media (e.g., DL media, application layer control signalling) via the unicast delivery to the reporting MC service client.

It will send the FEC request to MBSF/MBSTF.\nIt includes the following elements: the MBS session ID of the MBS session transporting those media, the media descriptions (codecs, transport protocols, bitrates, destination IP addresses and ports), the identification of the FEC repair packet flow (IP destination and port), and an upper bound to the additional latency resulting due to FEC application. The MC Service server may perform this request several times to protect separately different sets of media transported within the same 5G MBS session.\n2.\tIf the MBSF can satisfy the request, the Setup FEC response includes a modified list of media information and FEC information. The response also includes an identifier of the corresponding FEC process instance, which can be used to release the application of FEC for these media flows.\nNOTE 1:\tSource media packets may be modified by the application of FEC (e.g., addition of a footer or header), leading to a modification of the delivery protocol to be announced within the media information.\nNOTE 2:\tThe Release FEC request is not shown in the figure.\n3.\tThe MC service server announces the 5G MBS session to the MC service client with the MBS session announcement procedure, including the modified list of media information and FEC information within the SDP information.\n4.\tWhen the MC service server decides to transmit the MC service media flow for a group communication, the MC service server sends to the group a message identifying the MC service media flow and the MBS session ID, such as the MapGroupToSessionStream message for MCPTT or MCVideo.\n5.\tThe MC service server sends the downlink media to the MBSTF over Nmb8.\n6.\tThe MBSTF performs FEC encoding of the downlink media in accordance with the announced FEC algorithm and parameters and delivers it over 5G MBS.\n7.\tThe MC service client performs FEC decoding of the encoded media flows in accordance with the announced FEC information and delivers the decoded flows to the media player.",

The interaction between SIP core and 5GC is specified in 3GPP TS 23.228 [2]. The procedure for service continuity from on-network MCPTT service to UE-to-network relay MCPTT service is described in Annex B of 3GPP TS 23.280 [3].\nAs illustrated in figure B.1-1:\n-\tInitially UE-1 has a direct connection to the network via 5GS (on-network MCPTT service). It is registered with the SIP core and is engaged in a SIP session with the MCPTT Application Server (solid lines SIP-1 and MC[service]-1 in figure B.1-1).\n-\tWhen UE-1 realises that it is losing connection to the network, or after the connection to the network has been lost, UE-1 discovers a UE-to-network relay (UE-R) and establishes a PC5 connection with UE-R. UE-1 registers with the SIP core over the target access leg and enters UE-to-network relay MC service by transferring the media streams over the target leg (dashed lines SIP-1 and MC[service]-1 in figure B.1-1).\n-\tThe SIP session is anchored at a Service Centralisation and Continuity Application Server (SCC AS) before and after the handover, as described in 3GPP TS 23.237 [18].\nAnnex C
