      "content": "A PDN connection supporting NBIFOM provides simultaneous access to a single PDN via different access networks: a 3GPP access network and a WLAN access network. It is used by multi-radio (i.e. 3GPP and WLAN) capable UEs that are able to simultaneously connect to a given PDN via different access systems (3GPP and WLAN).\nIn order to enable NBIFOM, the UE can establish and maintain a PDN connection over both 3GPP access and WLAN access simultaneously. This is supported for both S2b and S2a connectivity. The UE can add an access to a PDN connection even if traffic is not immediately routed over the added access. When a PDN connection is established over both 3GPP access and WLAN access simultaneously there is one default bearer for each access.\nOn a PDN connection established over both 3GPP access and WLAN access, it is possible to move individual IP flows from one access network to another, when policies determine that flows should be moved and the target access is available for the UE.\nThe PDN GW performs IP flow routing of downlink traffic. The UE performs IP flow routing of uplink traffic.\nA mechanism is defined for the UE and the network to discover whether the network and the UE respectively support NBIFOM and to decide whether NBIFOM will be applied for a given PDN connection. This mechanism works on a per-PDN connection basis.\nThe UE and the PDN GW shall always be aware of which access IP flows of the PDN connection shall use.\nFor NBIFOM, the UE and the PDN GW exchange Routing Rules (RR). Routing Rules (RR) describe the mapping between a set of IP flows (identified by a Routing filter) and a Routing access type (e.g. 3GPP or WLAN) over which to route these IP flows.\nRouting rules are exchanged over control plane protocols (NAS over a 3GPP access, WLCP / IKE over WLAN access, S2a/S2b/S5/S8 control protocol).\nThe following NBIFOM modes are supported:\n-\tUE-initiated NBIFOM: In the UE-initiated NBIFOM mode only the UE controls the traffic routing within the multi-access PDN connection. The UE determines the Routing rules and provides them to the PDN GW. The network may either accept or reject the Routing Rules requested by the UE, but does not provide Routing rules itself.\n-\tNetwork-initiated NBIFOM: In the Network-initiated NBIFOM mode, the network controls the traffic routing within the multi-access PDN connection The PDN GW determines the Routing rules and provides them to the UE. The UE may either accept or reject the network's request for Routing rules (e.g. based on the suitability of the WLAN link conditions), but does not provide Routing Rules itself.\nThe NBIFOM mode that applies to a PDN connection is determined during the PDN connection establishment.\nRouting Rule installation is possible at any time during the lifetime of a PDN connection. Routing Rules can be installed even if there is no IP flow currently matching the routing filter in the Routing Rule.\nFor a UE with active flows on both 3GPP access and WLAN access, in case one of the accesses is lost or no longer usable, a mechanism is provided to move the IP Flows to the other (target) access in order to minimise service disruption. When an access is recovered, a mechanism is provided to move over this recovered access the IP Flows which are associated with policies giving precedence to this access. For UE-initiated NBIFOM mode, the UE-initiated IP flow mobility procedures described in clause 6.3.3 are used. For network-initiated NBIFOM mode, the procedures described in clause 6.6 are used.\nWhen PCC is deployed and supports NBIFOM, the PCRF provides the PDN GW with Access information which is part of PCC rules. The Access information controls the access over which the traffic that matches the Service data Flow template of this PCC rule should be sent.\nWhen PCC is not deployed or active for a PDN Connection, the PDN GW may apply static NBIFOM related policies. The PCEF static policy and control functionality is not based on subscription / user quota information.\nThe PDN GW translates Access information received in PCC rules into Routing Rules to be used between the UE and the PDN GW. In case UE initiated NBIFOM is applied and PCC is deployed for this PDN connection, the PDN GW provides, upon subscription of the PCRF, the PCRF with notifications of UE requests for IP flow mapping to an Access Type. In that case, the PCRF analyses the received information (requested IP flow mapping to an Access Type), makes a policy decision and provides PCC rules to the PDN GW with corresponding Access Type values.\nIn a PLMN all MME(s), SGSN(s) and SGW(s) are assumed to have the same level of support of NBIFOM. If the PDN GW detects a change in the support of NBIFOM on the 3GPP access of a PDN connection, it removes the 3GPP access from the multi-access PDN connection.\nNOTE 1:\tThis may happen in the case of inter PLMN mobility.\nFor S2a case, NBIFOM applies in both Multi-Connection Mode (MCM) and Single-Connection Mode (SCM) modes but not in Transparent Single-Connection Mode (TSCM). In SCM mode:\n-\tRouting Rules are exchanged only on the 3GPP access. Delivery of Routing Rules delivery is further described in clause 5.3.\n-\tNo dedicated bearers are supported on the S2a access of the PDN connection.\n-\tThere is no way to indicate the loss of 3GPP access to the PGW in SCM. There is no support for the indication of loss of 3GPP access in SCM.\nNOTE 2:\tFollowing features are not supported in this release of the specification:\n-\tThe support of Routing rules referring to an Application Id,\n-\tThe support of Network Based Mobility based on PMIP.",

The intermediate nodes (e.g. MME, SGSN, TWAG, ePDG, etc.) indicate to the PDN GW whether they support NBIFOM in the corresponding Create Session Request. When PCC is deployed, the PDN GW communicates to the PCRF whether the UE and network support NBIFOM. The PCRF then takes the decision on whether NBIFOM may apply to a PDN connection and communicates this decision to the PDN GW. If the network (i.e. all the EPC elements in the signalling chain from UE to PDN GW) supports NBIFOM and is willing to accept NBIFOM for this PDN connection, the PDN GW confirms the NBIFOM support in a \"NBIFOM accepted\" indication sent back to the UE in the PDN connection establishment accept message (or in the corresponding EAP-AKA' signalling in S2a/SCM case).\nNOTE:\tIt is assumed that intermediate nodes (e.g. MME, SGSN, TWAG, ePDG, etc.) do not need to know whether NBIFOM finally applies to the PDN connection.\nThe UE shall enforce that NBIFOM applies either to none or to all  PDN connections set by an UE on a given APN; this e.g.  applies when the UE decides whether to require NBIFOM at the activation of a PDN connection, or when the UE decides whether adding  or removing an access to or from a PDN connection.\nDuring the inter PLMN mobility, the new MME, SGSN and S-GW also indicate to the P-GW whether they support the NBIFOM.

The UE is not allowed to modify/remove a Routing Filter that the network has previously added using network-initiated IP flow mobility procedure. The corresponding call flows are provided in clause 6.4.\nThe UE can indicate to the network when an access of a multi-access PDN connection can or cannot be used for traffic routing. For example:\n-\tWhen the UE loses the WLAN signal and the UE has active IP flows over WLAN, then the UE indicates to the network that WLAN cannot be used for traffic routing. This triggers the network to stop sending downlink traffic for these IP flows over WLAN access and provide updated routing rules to the UE. The UE and the network re-route one or more of these IP flows to 3GPP access, if the existing routing rules do not prevent them from using 3GPP access.\n-\tWhen the UE recovers the WLAN signal and the existing routing rules in the UE require some active IP flows to be routed over WLAN, the UE indicates to the network that WLAN can again be used for traffic routing within the PDN connection. The network provides updated routing rules to the UE for the IP flows that are moved to WLAN access. The UE and the network re-route these active IP flows to WLAN access.\n-\tThe UE uses its Local Operating Environment (as defined in TS 23.261 [7]) to decide when the above indications should be sent to the network.\nThe network may provide to UE a \"RAN rules / RCLWI handling\" parameter during the PDN connection establishment procedure via 3GPP if the Network-initiated mode is selected (as specified in clause 5.4.4). When this parameter is set, it indicates that the UE shall use the \"move traffic to/from WLAN\" indications from Access Stratum under the conditions specified in bullet (a) below. When this parameter is not set or is not provided, it indicates that the UE shall not use the \"move traffic to/from WLAN\" indications. The UE uses the \"RAN rules / RCLWI handling\" parameter as specified below:\n(a)\tIf the \"RAN rules / RCLWI handling\" is set, the UE has no ISRP rule valid in the registered PLMN and the UE supports RAN-assisted WLAN interworking and/or and RCLWI, then the UE shall use the \"move traffic to/from WLAN\" indications from Access Stratum as follows:\n-\tWhen Access Stratum indicates that traffic should be moved to 3GPP access, the UE shall send a move-from-WLAN indication to the network. The network then shall provide updated routing rules to the UE for traffic routing within the multi-access PDN connection.\n-\tWhen Access Stratum indicates that traffic should be moved to WLAN access and the Local Operating Environment Information in the UE does not contain non-radio-related conditions that prohibit the use of WLAN access, the UE shall send a move-to-WLAN indication to the network. The network then shall provide updated routing rules to the UE for traffic routing within the multi-access PDN connection.\n-\tThe UE shall ignore the WLAN offloadability indication sent by MME.\n(b)\tIn all other cases, the UE shall not use the \"move traffic to/from WLAN\" indications from the Access Stratum.

In the case of 3GPP access and WLAN access with S2a, NBIFOM is not supported by an intermediate node (i.e. MME/SGSN, SGW, TWAG) while the UE requests to add an additional access to a PDN connection, the network should reject the PDN connectivity request with the appropriate cause value to indicate the failure of adding an additional access for NBIFOM. However, the previously established PDN connection shall be maintained on the first access.\nNOTE 3:\tIn the case of WLAN access with S2b, when NBIFOM is not supported by an ePDG, the addition of WLAN access is treated by the PGW as handover request. If the UE successfully connects with the ePDG but does not receive an NBIFOM indication in IKEv2 signalling from the network, the UE determines that its PDN connection over 3GPP access was handed over to WLAN.\nWhen PCC applies, the PDN GW initiates an IP-CAN Modification Procedure to inform the PCRF about the UE request to add an access to an already established IP-CAN session and about the added RAT type and IP-CAN type. The PDN GW confirms the NBIFOM support in a \"NBIFOM accepted\" indication sent back to the UE in the PDN connection establishment accept message (or in the corresponding EAP-AKA' signalling in S2a/SCM case)\nThe Addition of one access to a Multi-access PDN connection is further described in clause 6.2",

The PDN GW may initiate dedicated bearer activation and/or modification procedure in WLAN access according to if the IP flow shall be transported to new dedicated bearer or to existing bearer. If IP flows are moved from WLAN access to 3GPP, the PDN GW may release the resource in the WLAN access network. These procedures are described according to Figure 6.3.2.1-2 from Steps 3 to 7.",
