MCData is a suite of services which utilizes the common functional architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.280 [5] to support MC services over LTE including the common services core.\nMCData services suite consists of the following sub-services:\n-\tshort data service (SDS);\n-\tfile distribution (FD);\n-\tdata streaming (DS); and\nNOTE:\tProcedures for DS are not covered in the current specification.\n-\tIP connectivity.\nMCData features include:\n-\tconversation management;\n-\ttransmission and reception control;\n-\tcommunication release; and\n-\tenhanced status.\nThe corresponding service requirements are defined in 3GPP TS 22.282 [3] and 3GPP TS 22.280 [2].\nThe present document is applicable primarily to MCData service using E-UTRAN access based on the EPC architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.401 [4]. Certain application functions of the MCData service could also be supported via non-3GPP access networks but no additional functionality is specified to support non-3GPP access.\nThe MCData service can be used for public safety applications and also for general commercial applications e.g. utility companies and railways.",

The MCData server may still reject the sent message (e.g. if there is no authority to send).\nFor MCData types other than SDS using signalling control plane, the MCData service invokes a transmission request grant approach before data is permitted to be transmitted. The MCData service provides configurable limits for the maximum amount of data for and/or maximum amount of time that an MCData user can transmit in a single request, which may be configured by the MCData administrator.\nFor congestion control, related to transmission requests, the MCData service may perform the following:\n-\treject the data transmission requests and then shall notify the MCData user of the rejection;\n-\tqueue the data transmission requests; or\n-\tat any time, withhold the permission to transmit data automatically.\nThe MCData service shall notify the transmitting MCData group member if there are no other MCData group members affiliated to the MCData group.\nThe MCData service supports the lossless communication, and it can be configured by the MCData administrator for the private communication and group communication. The lossless communication can be supported only if the user has a valid and active MCData message store account. If the lossless communication is configured for private communication and if the MCData communication cannot be delivered to the MCData user (e.g. if the recipient is not available at the time of data delivery or network congestion), it shall be made available to the MCData user by storing it in the MCData user's personal account in the MCData message store.

However, only the initiator can cancel the initiator's local MCData emergency state.\n2.\tThe MCData client 1 sends an MCData group SDS communication in-progress priority state cancel request to the MCData server. The MCData client 1 also resets the emergency indicator in the request to inform MCData server about cancellation of in-progress emergency group state.\nNOTE 2:\tIf an MCData emergency alert relating to MCData client 1 is in effect together with an MCData in-progress emergency group state on the MCData group, the MCData emergency alert of MCData client 1 can be cancelled at the same time.

      "content": "The procedure in figure 7.5.2.13.2-1 describes the case where an authorized MCData user cancels MCData group's in-progress emergency.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe MCData group is previously defined on the group management server with MCData client 1, MCData client 2 and MCData client 3 affiliated to that MCData group.\n2.\tAll members of the MCData group belong to the same MCData system.\n3.\tMCData group members have been notified about the in-progress emergency.\n4.\tThe MCData group is in the in-progress emergency state and has prioritized bearer support.\n5.\tMCData client 1 previously initiated the in-progress emergency for the group.\nFigure 7.5.2.13.2-1: MCData group FD in-progress emergency group state cancel\n1.\tThe user at the MCData client 1 initiates an MCData group FD in-progress emergency group state cancel.\nNOTE 1:\tAn MCData user authorized to cancel in-progress emergencies on the MCData group can also be authorised to cancel the MCData emergency alert in addition to the initiator. However, only the initiator can cancel the initiator's local MCData emergency state.\n2.\tThe MCData client 1 sends an MCData group FD in-progress priority state cancel request to the MCData server. The MCData client 1 also resets emergency indicator in the request to inform MCData server about cancellation of in-progress emergency group state.\nNOTE 2:\tIf an MCData emergency alert relating to MCData client 1 is in effect together with an MCData in-progress emergency group state on the MCData group, the MCData emergency alert of MCData client 1 can be cancelled at the same time. In that case, the MCData group FD in-progress priority group state cancel request carries an indication that the emergency alert of MCData client 1 is also being cancelled.\nNOTE 3:\tIf an MCData group FD in-progress priority state cancel request is received by the MCData server while a group member that is in the emergency state is transmitting, the MCData group FD in-progress priority state cancel request is rejected by the MCData server.\n3.\tThe MCData server adjusts the priority of the underlying bearer; priority treatment is no longer required. The MCData server cancels/resets the emergency in-progress state of the MCData group.\n4.\tThe MCData server sends an MCData group FD in-progress priority state cancel request to the MCData group members.\n5.\tMCData group members are notified of the MCData group FD in-progress emergency state cancel.\n6.\tThe receiving MCData clients send the MCData group FD in-progress priority state cancel response to the MCData server to acknowledge the MCData in-progress emergency group state cancel. For a multicast call scenario, these acknowledgements are not sent.\n7.\tThe MCData server sends the MCData group FD in-progress priority state cancel response to the MCData user 1 to confirm the MCData in-progress emergency group state cancel. If the MCData in-progress emergency group state cancel request (in step 2) contained the \"Alert indicator\" IE, the MCData client 1 resets its local emergency status.\nNOTE 4:\tStep 7 can occur at any time following step 3, depending on the conditions to proceed with the call.",

The objects in the MCData message store are managed from both the MCData server and the message store client.\nEach MCData user is allocated a dedicated and secured storage area (i.e. with a user account) in the MCData message store. All MCData communications of a MCData user can be stored in his dedicated storage area. The access to this secured storage area is possible only after successful authentication and authorization procedures.

Figure 7.13.1 below illustrates the high-level structure of a MCData message store:\nFigure 7.13.1 Message store structure\nAs illustrated in Figure 7.13.1 all MCData user storage areas are accessed only through the common root. The authorized MCData user shall only have the access to the MCData user's storage area after the successful authentication and authorization procedures. A MCData user shall not be able to access objects stored for other MCData users.\nThe MCData user shall manage his stored objects using message store client through the MCData-7 reference point. The MCData server shall use the MCData-8 reference point to deposit MCData communication information, during an active MCData communication, into the designated MCData user's storage area in the MCData message store.\nOne way to manage user stored objects is using folder hierarchy structure like the popular email system today. Annex D provides a simple example of how it will look like in deployment. When the user account is created in the MCData message store, a default folder (such as Inbox) is also created to capture all the objects during an active communication. To group relevant stored objects together and provide easier navigation interactively, a MCData user can create folders in his user account. Each folder is identified by its unique folder identifier that is composed with the location of the folder and the name of the folder. A folder may have child folders to further group the stored objects in more meaningful ways. For example, the folder identifier of the default Inbox folder is /MCDatamessagestore /MCDatauser1/Inbox. The folder identifier /MCDatamessagestore/MCDatauser1/Squad1/20190225 points to a folder named 20190225 which is a child folder of Squad1 folder in the MCData user1 user account.\nNOTE:\tThe details of how the objects are stored in the MCData message store is out of scope of the present document.",

This procedure uses a web base notification mechanism in wide deployment today. The Message notification client requests the notification service from the MCData notification server and the MCData notification server returns with two URLs; one used by the service client to inform the service server where to send notification messages and the other one to use by the service client to PULL notification messages from the MCData notification server.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe MCData user has an account with the MCData message store.\n2.\tA successful authentication and authorization have been performed between the message store client and the MCData message store.\n3.\tThe Message store client doesn't have an ongoing session with the MCData message store.\n4.\tThe trust relationship between the MCData notification server and the MCData message store has been established.\n5.\tThe MCData notification server has a trust relationship and connection with the PUSH Enabler server.\nFigure 7.13.3.17.3-1: Notify client to synchronize through MCData notification server\n1.\tThe Message notification client wants to create notification channels (i.e. endpoint URLs) to be used by the MCData message store to send notification messages and sends a Create notification channel request to the MCData notification server. The desired validity duration for the channels to be used and the notification channel type (PUSH or PULL) are included in the request.\n2.\tThe MCData notification server authenticates the Message notification client and authorizes its request.\n3.\tThe MCData notification server sends the Message notification client the Create notification channel response with the endpoint URLs that will be used by the MCData message store to send the notification messages and the Message notification client to receive the notification messages. The MCData notification server also includes what is the valid duration for these endpoint URLs to be used in the response.\n4.\tIf the notification type is PULL method, the message notification client sends the Open notification channel to the MCData notification server to start receiving the notification message. For certain PUSH method notification type (such as WebSockets) the message notification client requests the MCData notification server to start the PUSH notification service with its specific protocol that is outside the scope of this specification.\n5.\tThe message store client sends the Subscribe for notification request to the MCData message store asking to be notified if there are changes to its message store account. The callback URL returned from the MCData notification server in step 3 is included in the request for the MCData message store to use to send notification messages.\n6.\tThe MCData message store sends the Subscribe for notification response to the message store client to acknowledge the request.\n7.\tThe MCData user's message store account has changed and the MCData message store generates a notification message.\n8.\tUsing the callback URL, the MCData message store sends the notification message to the MCData notification server.\n9.\tIf the delivery method is PULL, the MCData notification server sends the notification message to the message notification client over the opened notification channel. If the delivery method is PUSH, the MCData notification server sends the notification message to the PUSH Enabler server (not shown in the figure) to deliver to the message notification client.\nNOTE:\tThe PUSH Enabler server is implementation specific and outside the scope of this specification.\nThe procedure in figure 7.13.3.17.3-2 describes how the message notification client updates the validity duration of a notification channel and subscription to avoid its expiration, i.e. to extend its lifetime.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tA notification channel has already been requested and established between the message notification client and MCData notification server.\n2.\tThe message store client has a successful notification subscription with the MCData message store.\n3.\tThe validity duration of the notification channel is about to expire.\nFigure 7.13.3.17.3-2: Update a notification channel\n1.\tThe message notification client sends the Update notification channel request, including the desired new validity duration, to the MCData notification server.\n2.\tThe MCData notification server grants the request and sends the Update notification channel response to the message notification client. The new validity duration is included in the response.\n3.\tThe message store client sends the Update notification subscription request to the MCData message store with the new validity duration received from the MCData notification server in step 2.\n4.\tThe MCData message store  sends the Update notification subscription response to the message store client and confirms the new validity duration.\nThe procedure in figure 7.13.3.17.3-3 describes how the message notification client delete a notification channel and subscription that is no longer needed.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tA notification channel has already been requested and established between the message notification client and MCData notification server.\n2.\tThe message store client has a successful notification subscription with the MCData message store.\n3.\tThe MCData user no longer wants to receive notifications from the MCData message store.\nFigure 7.13.3.17.3-3: Delete a notification channel\n1.\tThe message store client decides to stop receiving notifications from the MCData message store and sends the Delete notification subscription request to the MCData message store.\n2.\tThe MCData message store acknowledges the request and sends the Delete notification subscription response to the message store client.\n3.\tThe message notification client sends the Delete notification channel request to the MCData notification server.\n4.\tThe MCData notification server acknowledges the request and sends the Delete notification channel response to the message notification client.",

The ProSe Layer-2 Group ID of the target MCData group may be used by the ProSe layer as the target group info and the discovery group ID (defined in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7]).\nPrior to initiating an off-network MCData group communication, a group member discovery procedure may be initiated to identify whether other members of the target MCData group are in the proximity of the MCData user sending data, as described in the ProSe direct discovery for public safety use procedure in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7]. The off-network MCData group communication using the ProSe capability is based on the one-to-many ProSe direct communication procedure for public safety use described in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7].\nFor an off-network one-to-one MCData communication, the MCData client obtains configuration data such as the ProSe discovery group ID and user info ID of the target MCData user from the \"List of MCData users this MCData user is authorized to initiate a one to-one communication\" in the MCData user profile and requests the IP address of the MCData UE associated with the target MCData user from the ProSe layer.\nThe MCData client enables the ProSe layer to determine the IP address for the communication with the target MCData UE by providing the ProSe discovery group ID and user info ID (as defined in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7]) associated to the target MCData user. This may trigger the ProSe direct discovery for public safety use procedure to identify whether the target MCData user is in the proximity of the MCData user sending data. The user info ID of the target MCData user is used by the ProSe layer as the target info (as defined in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7]).\nThe ProSe layer can then provide the IP address related to the target MCData user to the MCData client to initiate the off-network one-to-one MCData communication based on the one-to-one ProSe direct communication procedure described in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7].",

The configuration data in each configuration category corresponds to a single instance of the category type i.e. the MCData UE, MCData group, MCData user and MCData service configuration data refers to the information that will be stored against each MCData UE, MCData group, MCData user and MCData service. This means that the three separate tables (on-network and off-network, on-network only, off-network only) for each configuration category represent the complete set of data for each configuration data category element.\nThe columns in the tables have the following meanings:\n-\tReference: the reference of the corresponding requirement in 3GPP TS 22.282 [3] or 3GPP TS 22.280 [2] or the corresponding subclause from either the present document or the referenced document.\n-\tParameter description: A short definition of the semantics of the corresponding item of data, including denotation of the level of the parameter in the configuration hierarchy.\n-\tWhen it is not clear to which functional entities the parameter is configured, then one or more columns indicating this are provided where the following nomenclature is used:\n-\t\"Y\" to denote \"Yes\" i.e. the parameter denoted for the row needs to be configured to the functional entity denoted for the column.\n-\t\"N\" to denote \"No\" i.e. the parameter denoted for the row does not need to be configured to the functional entity denoted for the column.\nParameters within a set of configuration data have a level within a hierarchy that pertains only to that configuration data. The hierarchy of the configuration data is common across all three tables of on-network and off-network, on network only and off network only. The level of a parameter within the hierarchy of the configuration data is denoted by use of the character \">\" in the parameter description field within each table, one per level. Parameters that are at the top most level within the hierarchy have no \">\" character. Parameters that have one or more \">\" characters are child parameters of the first parameter above them that has one less \">\" character. Parent parameters are parameters that have one or more child parameters. Parent parameters act solely as a \"grouping\" of their child parameters and therefore do not contain an actual value themselves i.e. they are just containers for their child parameters.\nEach parameter that can be configured online shall only be configured through one online reference point. Each parameter that can be configured offline shall only be configured through one offline reference point. The most recent configuration data made available to the MCData UE shall always overwrite previous configuration data, irrespective of whether the configuration data was provided via the online or offline mechanism.\nA.2\tMCData UE configuration data\nThe general aspects of UE configuration are specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [5]. Data in tables A.2-1 and A.2-2 have to be known by the MCData UE after MCData authorization.\nData in table A.2-1 can be configured offline using the CSC-11 reference point. Table A.2-1 contains the UE configuration required to support the use of off-network MCData service.\nTable A.2-1: UE configuration data (on and off network)\nReference\nParameter description\nShort data service\n[R-5.4.2-002] of 3GPP TS 22.280 [2]\n> Maximum number of simultaneous SDS transactions (Nc4)\n[R-5.4.2-004] of 3GPP TS 22.280 [2]\n> Requested presentation priority of SDS messages received (see NOTE)\nFile distribution\n[R-5.4.2-002] of 3GPP TS 22.280 [2]\n> Maximum number of simultaneous file distribution transactions (Nc4)\nTransmission control\n[R-5.4.2-002] of 3GPP TS 22.280 [2]\n> Maximum number of simultaneous data transmissions (Nc4)\n[R-5.4.2-003] of 3GPP TS 22.280 [2]\n> Maximum number of data transmissions (Nc5) in a group\nReception control\n[R-5.4.2-002] of 3GPP TS 22.280 [2]\n> Maximum number of simultaneous data receptions (Nc4)\n[R-5.4.2-003] of 3GPP TS 22.280 [2]\n> Maximum number of data receptions (Nc5) in a group\nNOTE:\tPriority of SDS messages includes enhanced status updates, since enhanced status updates utilise the SDS mechanism.\nTable A.2-2: UE configuration data (on network)\nReference\nParameter description\nSubclause 5.2.3 of 3GPP TS 23.280 [6]\nRelay service (Y/N)\nSubclause 5.2.3 of 3GPP TS 23.280 [6]\nList of allowed relayed MCData groups and their relay service code (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7]) (optional) (see NOTE)\n> MCData group ID\n> Relay service code (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7])\nNOTE:\tWhen the value of the parameter Relay service is N, this parameter and its child parameters are not needed.\nA.3\tMCData user profile configuration data\nThe general aspects of MC service user profile configuration data are specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [5]. The MCData user profile configuration data is stored in the MCData user database. The MCData server obtains the MCData user profile configuration data from the MCData user database (MCData-2).\nTables A.3-1 and A.3-2 contain the MCData user profile configuration required to support the use of on-network MCData service. Tables A.3-1 and A.3-3 contain the MCData user profile configuration required to support the use of off-network MCData service.

For each communication, how the requests are processed may be different. The requests that are not authorized shall be rejected by the transmission control function. For message requests over the signalling control plane, the processing should be immediate and is delivered to the recipients either via unicast or broadcast. However, for message requests over the media plane, transmission control arbitration (see Annex B.2) will be necessary. Subsequent to transmission control arbitration, and subject to the policy e.g. store and forward, the data is either delivered directly to the recipient MCData user or stored in the network repository and a corresponding URL is delivered. The end-to-end transmission control process is illustrated in figure B.1-1.\nFigure B.1-1: Transmission control process\nB.2\tTransmission control arbitration\nThe transmission control arbitration is a central function of the transmission control process and is implementation specific. In a typical deployment, multiple or simultaneous requests can be received at the transmission control arbitration function. Each of these requests may be categorized into different request types with different queuing priorities, and therefore each request type will be maintained with separate queues. Each request shall not be present in more than one queue at any given time. The queue types and the order of queues may be configured by the MCData administrator, as described below.\n-\tTransmission control queue: It is the primary queue from which the request is processed for transmission e.g. emergency communication requests may result in this queue and processed at the highest priority.\n-\tCommunication type queue: This queue may be sorted in the order of the communication type associated with the request. For example, the group communication requests may always take precedence over one-to-many or private communication requests.\n-\tStatic attribute queue: This queue may be formed based on the static attributes associated with the request e.g. group priority, user priority, which may be pre-configured by the MCData administrator.\n-\tDynamic attribute queue: This queue may be formed based on the dynamic attributes associated with the request e.g. location of the sending user, content size, etc.\nAnnex C:\tVoid\nAnnex D (informative):Example of a User Message Storage Area\nThe figure in subclause 7.13.1 illustrates the high-level structure of the MCData message store where objects are stored in a flat structure in the user storage area. This flat data structure provides maximum flexibility for UI implementation to present stored objects to the user. However, a folder hierarchy structure provides a better visual presentation of the stored objects to the MCData user.\nFigure D-1: User message storage area example\nIn figure D-1 the MCData user 1 message storage area in the MCData message store is constructed in folder hierarchical way. A system default folder, Inbox, is configured to receive all new objects coming from active communications. The MCData user 1 creates Group 1, Group 2 and Group N folders to store communication history for different group communications that he is a member of. Once the Group 1 folder is created the MCData user 1 can then move all the objects related to Group 1 communication from the Inbox to the Group 1 folder. The MCData user 1 can also create child folders in Group 1 folder to further divide the stored objects into different groupings such as with different subjects, Subject 1 and Subject 2. Similarly, the MCData user 1 creates child folders, Date 1 and Date 2, in Group N folder to store communication history in group N occurred in different dates. With this hierarchical folder structure, the MCData user 1 can browse his user account in the MCData message store interactively and navigate to the information he would like to see. For example, the MCData user 1 can start with the top-level root folder and traverse down the folder hierarchy to reach to Date 2 folder and see the communication history of group N in that particular date.\nAnnex E (informative):Change history\nChange history\nDate\nMeeting\nTDoc\nCR\nRev\nCat\nSubject/Comment\nNew version\n2016-07\nInitial version.\n0.0.0\n2016-08\nUpdate following SA6#12
