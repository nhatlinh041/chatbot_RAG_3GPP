      "content": "The enhanced Multi-Level Precedence and Pre-emption service (eMLPP) provides different levels of precedence for call set-up and for call continuity in case of handover.\nThere are seven priority levels which are defined in 3GPP TS 22.067. The highest level (A) is reserved for network internal use. The second highest level (B) may be used for network internal use or, optionally, depending on regional requirements, for subscription. These two levels (A and B) may only be used locally, i.e. in the domain of one MSC. The other five priority levels are offered for subscription and may be applied globally, e.g. on inter switch trunks, if supported by all related network elements, and also for interworking with ISDN networks providing the MLPP service.\nThe seven priority levels are defined as follows:\nA\t(highest, for network internal use)\nB\t(for network internal use or, optionally, for subscription)\n0\t(for subscription)\n1\t(for subscription)\n2\t(for subscription)\n3\t(for subscription)\n4\t(lowest, for subscription).\nLevels A and B shall be mapped to level 0 for priority treatment outside of the MSC area in which they are applied.\nAs a network specific configuration, the ability to pre-empt other calls of lower priority and the application of fast call set-up procedures can be assigned to each priority level. An example for an eMLPP configuration is given in 3GPP TS 22.067.\nNOTE 1:\tThe present specification defines the concepts for handling of priorities in the network including the indication whether pre-emption or fast call set-up procedures are to be applied. Note that the call set-up procedures themselves are specified in the corresponding stage 2 descriptions of the services where they are to be used. There is presently only a requirement for VBS and VGCS (3GPP TS 43.069 and 3GPP TS 43.068, respectively).\nNOTE 2:\tThe network operator has to assure that the particular eMLPP configuration he applies and the subscriptions he issues are co-ordinated with the network planning (especially for blocking) and the implementation options applied (e.g. the use of OACSU) in order to guarantee the service performance for the subscriber.\nConsidering aspects of priority handling, the following issues can be considered for each call:\na)\tcontention during the initial random access (no specific definitions apply for eMLPP. Delays due to access collision have to be managed by a corresponding planning of the network resources);\nb)\tin GSM, contention in gaining radio resources during the call set-up phase and during handover (this item relates to the assignment of SDCCH and TCH for which queuing and pre-emption mechanisms are applied for eMLPP);\nin UMTS, contention in gaining radio resources during the call set-up phase and during relocation (this item relates to the assignment of DCCH and DTCH for which queuing and pre-emption mechanisms are applied for eMLPP);\nA pre-emption might already be performed as a network option on the basis of the establishment cause if a network specific eMLPP configuration assigns a certain priority level to a particular establishment cause.\nc)\tcontention in gaining terrestrial resources inside the GSM or UMTS network (this item relates to the assignment of terrestrial channels between the GSM or UMTS network nodes. Priority actions shall be performed on basis of the MLPP service implementations. The eMLPP priority levels A and B shall be mapped to the MLPP priority level 0. No further specific definitions apply for eMLPP);\nd)\tcontention in gaining terrestrial resources in external networks (this item relates to interworking with external networks which shall be performed on basis of the MLPP service if provided in the related external networks.);\ne)\tapplication of different call set-up procedures in relation to the priority levels and the network specific configuration (three classes of set-up performance are defined in 3GPP TS 22.067, one very fast class for VBS or VGCS emergency call services, one class for fast but normal set-up times and one class allowing some delay in the set-up. The application of the corresponding procedures shall be decided by the network on the basis of the requested priority level);\nf)\tautomatic answering of calls if the incoming call exceeds a defined priority level (if the MS is in idle mode), or called party pre-emption (if the called subscriber is engaged in communication of a lower priority);\ng)\tthe means by which the called user is informed of priority issues and is able to make appropriate decisions if no called party pre-emption applies;\nh)\tthe accommodation of non-compatible Mobile Stations.\nThe definitions in the present specification focus on the issues under item b), e), f), g) and h). Items c) and d) are related to the MLPP service implementation for the signalling system No. 7 according to ITU-T Recommendations Q.85 and Q.735.\nFor a call establishment, a subscriber shall be able to select any one of the priority levels he has subscribed to.\nPriorities shall be treated in the network as defined in 3GPP TS 22.067. Priority treatment is different for point-to-point calls and voice broadcast calls or voice group calls, respectively:\n-\tmobile originated point-to-point call:\nThe priority level depends on the calling subscriber. If the user has no eMLPP subscription, the call shall have a default priority level defined in the network. If the user has an eMLPP subscription, the call shall have the priority level selected by the user at set-up or the priority level predefined by the subscriber as default priority level by registration.\n-\tmobile terminated point-to-point calls:\nThe priority level depends on the calling party. For this, interworking with the ISDN MLPP service is required. If the call is not an MLPP call, i.e. no priority level is defined, the call shall be treated in the mobile network with a default priority level. If the call is an MLPP call, the call shall be treated with the priority level provided by the interfacing network.\n-\tmobile to mobile point-to-point calls:\nThe priority shall be treated for the calling subscriber as for mobile originated calls and for the called subscriber as for mobile terminated calls. However, an interworking with MLPP is not required if both the calling subscriber and the called subscriber are located in the same MSC area.\n-\tVoice Broadcast Calls (VBS) and Voice Group Calls (VGCS):\nThe link on the voice broadcast call channel or voice group call channel shall have the priority level as defined in the corresponding registration for the related voice broadcast call or voice group call in the GCR. At the early stage of a voice broadcast call or voice group call establishment, before the GCR request is made and the voice broadcast call channel or voice group call channels are assigned, the procedure shall be the same as for point-to-point calls. If the GCR response includes a priority level it shall be applied to the dedicated link of the calling mobile station as well.\nQueuing and resource pre-emption shall then be applied as appropriate according to the network service configuration. In addition, automatic answering or called party pre-emption shall be applied as appropriated according to the Mobile Station's internal service configuration.\nThe MSC shall maintain a record of the priority level of each call in progress in its area such that it can arbitrate over resources in a defined manner.\nThe priority level can be included in the CM_SERVICE_REQUEST message in the case that a user establishing a point-to-point call is using a compatible Mobile Station (see clause 6).\nIf the subscriber has not selected a priority level for that call or uses a non compatible Mobile Station (see clause 6), the priority level shall be assigned according to the respective VLR data.\nThe priority level of a call shall be determined by the MSC. Accordingly, the MSC shall request channel assignment with an indication of the priority level and the pre-emption capability of that call. For this the MSC shall use the priority message element as defined in 3GPP TS 48.008. Mapping of the priority information in this message element on the network specific eMLPP configuration shall be performed in the MSC. Queuing and resource pre-emption shall be performed accordingly if necessary.\nIn GSM, in addition to the priority signalling, the requirement for a direct assignment of a TCH shall be included in the establishment cause of the CHAN_REQ message in order to support a fast call set-up procedure in the BSC at the earliest possible stage of the call establishment for high priority calls if applicable.\nIn UMTS, in addition to the priority signalling, the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST message shall be included the establishment cause.\nAutomatic answering or, if necessary, called-party pre-emption has to be performed by the Mobile Station as defined in the following:\n-\tpoint-to-point calls:\nIf the user is in idle mode, the Mobile Station shall automatically connect to an incoming call of a sufficient priority level. The priority level shall be included in the paging message and in the set-up message. If the user is in dedicated mode and has a subscription to Call Waiting, a Call Waiting indication including the priority level of the call shall be given to the Mobile Station which automatically accepts the waiting call.\nThere is no called party pre-emption for point-to-point calls without Call Waiting.\n-\tvoice group calls and voice broadcast calls:\nNotifications for other voice group calls, voice broadcast calls or information on paging for point-to-point calls shall be given to the Mobile Stations involved in on-going voice group calls or voice broadcast calls as defined in 3GPP TS 43.068 and 3GPP TS 43.069, respectively. The notifications include the related priority level of the call. In case of a notified call with higher priority where called-party pre-emption applies, the Mobile Station shall automatically leave the on-going voice group call or voice broadcast call and react according to the type of the notified call type.\nFor both cases, the priority level applied shall be included, either in the paging message or Call Waiting indication, or in the notification message, in order to enable the Mobile Station to decide on an automatic reaction (automatic answering or called-party pre-emption) or to indicate the incoming, non pre-empting call to the user.\nThe priority information of the assignment request shall also be applied for BSS internal and also UTRAN internal handover. For external handover, the MSC shall include the priority information in the handover request according to the definition in 3GPP TS 48.008 (for GSM) and TS 25.413 (for UMTS) in the same way as for the assignment request.",
