Due to the interleaving scheme, half of the bits of the frame preceding the SID and half of the bits of the frame following the SID are sent and there is no specific requirement covering what is sent for these bits but in most cases it is every other bit of a correctly coded frame. The MS receives these bits\nIn addition, when the ARFCN used is C0, dummy bursts are sent when there is neither speech nor signalling to be transmitted.\nFinally, when frequency hopping is used as well as downlink DTX, the MS may receive random RF on some TDMA frames and dummy bursts on others (C0).\nIt is possible for the MS to receive combinations of transmitted bits at high confidence and random RF at low confidence. In some cases the MS can then decode the frame as good when in fact it was never intended to have been transmitted and the resultant bad frame can give a very annoying acoustic effect known as banjo noise. The occurance of these noises, even if no more frequent than one in 10s, is worse than one would expect from a high quality cellular system.\nThe three following sections refer to ways of improving the system performance for MS approved according to the existing phase 1 specification. Section 6.3 identifies some \"normal\" operation configurations which would improve undetected bad frame performance for MS’s with the above fault (banjo noise), section 6.4 describes aspects for possible changed network implementation, section 6.5 relates the results of tests performed using combinations of the implementations described in section 6.4 and whether that combination was effective or not.",

The number of dummy bursts received depends on the number of ARFCN in the hopping list. Hence frequency hopping on 3 ARFCN gives better audio performance than frequency hopping on 2, likewise hopping on 4 ARFCN gives better performance than hopping on 3.\nIn tests of the comparison between hopping on 2 ARFCN and hopping on 3, some MS have been found to improve to approximately one tenth of the occurance of bad frames, while others have improved from a slightly annoying level when hopping on 2 ARFCN, to give no audible disruption when hopping on 3. Not all MS have been tested and it is believed that the improvement for some MS may be less noticeable.\nThis solution is obviously not trivial to implement in a frequency plan, but could also be used to enable frequency hopping on cells which naturally have 3 or more ARFCN operational whilst selecting a solution for other parts of the network and operational scenarios.",

The \"circuit pool list\" information element will allow the BSS to indicate to the MSC from which circuit pool or pools the new CIC should be chosen.\nThe \"Cell Identifier List (preferred)\" shall identify \"n\" preferred cells. The identified cells are given in order of preference. The algorithm by which the BSS produces this list is Operator dependent and is not addressed in this Technical Specification. The \"n\" number of preferred cells is a parameter set by O&M and shall range from 1 to 16. If \"n\" number of cells cannot be identified, then only as many as are available shall be encoded and sent (as specified in section 3.2.2.27).\nIt is mandatory for the BSS to be able to produce this \"Cell Identifier List (preferred)\". The sending of this list is controlled by the O&M parameter \"n\". It is mandatory for the MSC to be able to receive and interpret this Information Element.\nThe HANDOVER REQUIRED message shall be updated and repeated by the BSS with a periodicity of T7 until:\n-\tA HANDOVER COMMAND message is received from the MSC, or;\n-\tA RESET message is received, or;\n-\tThe reason for the original HANDOVER REQUIRED message disappears e.g. the MS transmission improves, or;\n-\tAll communication is lost with the MS as defined in Technical Specification 3GPP TS 04.08, and the transaction is abandoned, or;\n-\tThe transaction ends, e.g., call clearing.\nA.3.1.5.2\tHandover Resource allocation\nThis procedure has been defined to allow the MSC to request resources from a BSS in a manner similar to that used for the assignment case. However it does not result in the transmission of any messages over the radio interface, only in the reservation of the resource identified at the BSS, which awaits access of a MS on the reserved channel. These reserved resources are then indicated back to the MSC.\nIn order to support this procedure the MSC sets up a BSSAP SCCP connection to the BSS. This connection is then used to support all BSSAP messages related to this dedicated resource.\nA.3.1.5.2.1\tOperation of the procedure\nThe correct operation of the handover resource allocation  procedure is as follows:\nThe MSC sends a HANDOVER REQUEST message to the new BSS (note 1) from which it requires radio resources. This message contains details of the resource that is required. If the requested resource is for speech or data it also indicates the terrestrial resource that shall be used between the MSC and the BSS. The type of channel required can be different from the type of channel in use, e.g. in the case of directed retry. The description of the resource can either specify it completely, or give the BSS some freedom in the selection. The message may also specify the channel in use.\nOn receipt of this message the new BSS shall choose a suitable idle radio resource.\nThe management of priority levels - relating to the Information Element \"Priority\" within the HANDOVER REQUEST message - is implementation dependent, under operator control.\nIf queueing is managed, new requests which cannot be served immediately are put in the queueing file according to the indicated priority levels.\n(Refer to section 3.1.17 for Queuing Procedure)\nAs a further operator option, the preemption indicators may (alone or along with the priority levels) be used to manage the preemption process, which may lead to the forced release or forced handover of lower priority connections.\nHowever, the preemption indicators (refer to section 3.2.2.18), if given in the HANDOVER REQUEST, shall be treated on a per connection basis as follows:\n-\tthe last received \"Preemption Vulnerability\" indicator and priority levels shall prevail.\n-\tif the \"Preemption Capability\" bit is set to 1, then this allocation request can trigger the running of the preemption procedure.\n-\tif the \"Preemption Capability\" bit is set to 0, then this allocation request cannot trigger the preemption procedure.\n-\tif the \"Preemption Vulnerability\" bit is set to 1, then this connection is vulnerable and shall be included in the preemption process or procedure and as such may be subject to forced release or forced handover.\n-\tif the \"Preemption Vulnerability\" bit is set to 0, then this connection is not vulnerable to preemption and shall not be included in the preemption process and as such may not be subject to forced release or forced handover.\n-\tif no Priority Information Element has been received, both \"Preemption Capability\" and \"Preemption Vulnerability\" bits shall be regarded as set to 0.\nIf a radio resource is available then this will be reflected back to the MSC in a HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message. The HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message sent by the new BSS shall contain the radio interface message HANDOVER COMMAND within its \"Layer 3 Information\" Information Element. This \"Layer 3 Information\" (which is in fact the RR-Layer 3 HANDOVER COMMAND) is transferred by the controlling MSC to the old BSS using the BSSMAP message HANDOVER COMMAND also within the Information Element \"Layer 3 Information\" of that BSSMAP message. The old BSS then sends to the MS over the radio interface the RR-Layer 3 HANDOVER COMMAND message. Information about the appropriate new channels and a handover reference number chosen by the new BSS are contained in the HANDOVER COMMAND. Knowledge of the channel in use at the old BSS allows the new BSS to minimize the size of the HANDOVER COMMAND message (i.e. to decide whether the mode of the first channel IE need not be included in the HANDOVER COMMAND).\nNOTE:\tThe new BSS and the old BSS may be the same.\nWhen several circuit pools are present on the BSS MSC interface, the \"circuit pool\" information field shall be included in the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE. The \"circuit pool\" field will indicate to the MSC the circuit pool of the CIC given in the HANDOVER REQUEST message.\nThe sending of the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE by the new BSS to the MSC ends the Handover Resource Allocation procedure. The Handover Execution procedure can now proceed and this is given in section 3.1.5.3.\nThe new BSS shall then take all necessary action to allow the MS to access the radio resource that the new BSS has chosen, this is detailed in the 3GPP TS 05 series of Technical Specifications. If the radio resource is a traffic channel then the new BSS shall at this point switch it through to the terrestrial resource indicated in the HANDOVER REQUEST message, and the necessary transcoding/rate adaption/encryption equipment enabled as detailed in 3GPP TS 04.08.\nThe optimum procedure for switching through to the target cell at the MSC is not defined in these Technical Specifications.\nA.3.2.1.8\tHANDOVER REQUEST\nThis message is sent from the MSC to the BSS via the relevant SCCP connection to indicate that the MS is to be handed over to that BSS.\nINFORMATION ELEMENT\nREFERENCE\nDIRECTION\nTYPE\nLEN\nMessage type\n3.2.2.1\nMSC-BSS\nM\n1\nChannel type\n3.2.2.11\nMSC-BSS\nM\n5\nEncryption information\n3.2.2.10\nMSC-BSS\nM\n3-n\nClassmark information 1 or\n3.2.2.30\nMSC-BSS\nM#\n2\nClassmark information 2\n3.2.2.19\nMSC-BSS\nM#\n4-5\nCell identifier (serving)\n3.2.2.17\nMSC-BSS\nM\n5-10\nPriority\n3.2.2.18\nMSC-BSS\nO\n3\nCircuit identity code\n3.2.2.2\nMSC-BSS\nO##\n3\nDownlink DTX flag\n3.2.2.26\nMSC-BSS\nO*\n2\nCell identifier (target)\n3.2.2.17\nMSC-BSS\nM\n3-10\nInterference band to be used\n3.2.2.21\nMSC-BSS\nO\n2\nCause\n3.2.2.5\nMSC-BSS\nO\n3-4\nClassmark information 3\n3.2.2.20\nMSC-BSS\nO**\n3-14\nCurrent channel\n3.2.2.49\nMSC-BSS\nO§\n2\n*\tThis element may be included in the case of a speech TCH, and only in this case.
