      "content": "This procedure is used by the PCF to provide a list of new candidate PDTQ policies to the NF service consumer due to a network performance or DN performance degradation, as defined in clause 4.16.15.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] and clause 6.1.2.7 of 3GPP TS 23.503 [14].\nFigure 5.2.2.4.2-1 illustrates a PDTQ warning notification from the PCF.\nFigure 5.2.2.4.2-1: PDTQ warning notification\nWhen the PCF gets the notification from the NWDAF, that the network performance or DN performance in the requested area of interest reaches the reporting threshold as described in 3GPP TS 29.520 [18] and if the PDTQ warning notification is enabled, the PCF may try to renegotiate the affected PDTQ policies. To do this, the PCF retrieves all the PDTQ policies together with their additionally stored NF service consumer provided information for PDTQ policy decision (e.g. their corresponding list of desired time windows, the number of UEs, etc.) from the UDR, identifies the PDTQ policy(ies) that are not desirable anymore due to the degradation of the network performance or DN performance and tries to calculate one or more new candidate PDTQ policies based on the NF service consumer provided information, the PDTQ policies retrieved from the UDR and the current network performance or DN performance. If the PCF does not find any new candidate PDTQ policy, the previously negotiated PDTQ policy shall be kept and no interaction with the NF service consumer shall occur.\nIf one or more new candidate PDTQ policies are calculated, the PCF shall invoke the Npcf_PDTQPolicyControl_Notify service operation by sending the HTTP POST request with a PDTQ warning notification to the NF service consumer.\nThe PCF shall include in a body of the HTTP POST request a \"Notification\" data type which shall contain:\n-\tthe PDTQ Reference ID of the impacted PDTQ policy within the \"pdtqRefId\" attribute; and\n-\tthe list of candidates PDTQ policies in the \"candPolicies\" attribute.\nNOTE:\tThe NF service consumer might, or might not provide a new PDTQ policy from the offered candidate list.\nUpon the reception of the HTTP POST request from the PCF, the NF service consumer shall acknowledge that request by sending an HTTP response message with the corresponding status code:\n-\tif the NF service consumer determines the received HTTP POST request needs to be redirected, the NF service consumer shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4];\n-\tif the HTTP POST request from the PCF is accepted, the NF service consumer shall acknowledge the receipt of the notification with a \"204 No Content\" response to HTTP POST request, as shown in figure 5.2.2.4.2-1, step 2; or\n-\tif the HTTP POST request from the PCF is not accepted, the NF service consumer shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 6.1.7.",
