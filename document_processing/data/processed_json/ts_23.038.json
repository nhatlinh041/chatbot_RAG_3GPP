      "content": "The TP-Data-Coding-Scheme field, defined in 3GPP TS 23.040 [4], indicates the data coding scheme of the TP‑UD field, and may indicate a message class. Any reserved codings shall be assumed to be the GSM 7 bit default alphabet (the same as codepoint 00000000) by a receiving entity. The octet is used according to a coding group which is indicated in bits 7..4. The octet is then coded as follows:\nCoding Group Bits\n7..4\nUse of bits 3..0\n00xx\nGeneral Data Coding indicationBits 5..0 indicate the following:Bit 5, if set to 0, indicates the text is uncompressedBit 5, if set to 1, indicates the text is compressed using the  compression algorithm defined in 3GPP TS 23.042 [13] Bit 4, if set to 0, indicates that bits 1 to 0 are reserved and have no message class meaning\nBit 4, if set to 1, indicates that bits 1 to 0 have a message class meaning:: Bit 1\tBit 0\tMessage Class0    \t0     \tClass 00    \t1    \tClass 1   Default meaning: ME-specific.1    \t0    \tClass 2   (U)SIM specific message1    \t1    \tClass 3   Default meaning: TE specific (see 3GPP TS 27.005 [8]) Bits 3 and 2 indicate the character set being used, as follows :Bit 3\tBit2\tCharacter set:0         \t0\t      GSM 7 bit default alphabet0    \t1    \t8 bit data1    \t0    \tUCS2 (16bit) [10]1    \t1    \tReservedNOTE: The special case of bits 7..0 being 0000 0000 indicates the GSM 7 bit default alphabet with no message class\n01xx\nMessage Marked for Automatic Deletion Group\nThis group can be used by the SM originator to mark the message ( stored in the ME or (U)SIM ) for deletion after reading irrespective of the message class.\nThe way the ME will process this deletion should be manufacturer specific but shall be done without the intervention of the End User or the targeted application. The mobile manufacturer may optionally provide a means for the user to prevent this automatic deletion.\nBit 5..0 are coded exactly the same as Group 00xx\n1000..1011\nReserved coding groups\n1100\nMessage Waiting Indication Group: Discard Message\nThe specification for this group is exactly the same as for Group 1101, except that:\n- after presenting an indication and storing the status, the ME may discard the contents of the message.\nThe ME shall be able to receive, process and acknowledge messages in this group, irrespective of memory availability for other types of short message.\n1101\nMessage Waiting Indication Group: Store Message\nThis Group defines an indication to be provided to the user about the status of types of message waiting on systems connected to the GSM/UMTS PLMN. The ME should present this indication as an icon on the screen, or other MMI indication. The ME shall update the contents of the Message Waiting Indication Status on the SIM (see 3GPP TS 51.011 [18]) or USIM (see 3GPP TS 31.102 [17]) when present or otherwise should store the status in the ME. In case there are multiple records of EFMWIS this information shall be stored within the first record. The contents of the Message Waiting Indication Status should control the ME indicator. For each indication supported, the mobile may provide storage for the Origination Address. The ME may take note of the Origination Address for messages in this group and group 1100.\nText included in the user data is coded in the GSM 7 bit default alphabet.Where a message is received with bits 7..4 set to 1101, the mobile shall store the text of the SMS message in addition to setting the indication. The indication setting should take place irrespective of memory availability to store the short message.\nBits 3 indicates Indication Sense:\tBit 3\t0\tSet Indication Inactive\t1\tSet Indication Active\tBit 2 is reserved, and set to 0\tBit 1\tBit 0\tIndication Type:\t0\t\t0\t\tVoicemail Message Waiting\t0\t\t1\t\tFax Message Waiting\t1\t\t0\t\tElectronic Mail Message Waiting\t1\t\t1\t\tOther Message Waiting** Mobile manufacturers may implement the \"Other Message Waiting\" indication as an additional indication without specifying the meaning.\n1110\nMessage Waiting Indication Group: Store MessageThe coding of bits 3..0 and functionality of this feature are the same as for the Message Waiting Indication Group above, (bits 7..4 set to 1101) with the exception that the text included in the user data is coded in the uncompressed UCS2 character set.\n1111\nData coding/message class \tBit 3 is reserved, set to 0. \tBit 2\tMessage coding:\t0\t\tGSM 7 bit default alphabet\t1\t\t8-bit data \tBit 1\tBit 0\tMessage Class:\t0\t\t0\t\tClass 0\t0\t\t1\t\tClass 1    default meaning: ME-specific.\t1\t\t0\t\tClass 2    (U)SIM-specific message.\t1\t\t1\t\tClass 3    default meaning: TE specific (see 3GPP TS 27.005 [8])\nGSM 7 bit default alphabet indicates that the TP-UD is coded from the GSM 7 bit default alphabet given in clause 6.2.1. When this character set is used, the characters of the message are packed in octets as shown in clause 6.1.2.1.1, and the message can consist of up to 160 characters. The GSM 7 bit default alphabet shall be supported by all MSs and SCs offering the service. If the GSM 7 bit default alphabet extension mechanism is used then the number of displayable characters will reduce by one for every instance where the GSM 7 bit default alphabet extension table is used. 8-bit data indicates that the TP-UD has user-defined coding, and the message can consist of up to 140 octets.\nUCS2 character set indicates that the TP-UD has a UCS2 [10] coded message, and the message can consist of up to 140 octets, i.e. up to 70 UCS2 characters. The General notes specified in clause 6.1.1 override any contrary specification in UCS2, so for example even in UCS2 a <CR> character will cause the MS to return to the beginning of the current line and overwrite any existing text with the characters which follow the <CR>.\nWhen a message is compressed, the TP-UD consists of the GSM 7 bit default alphabet or UCS2 character set compressed message, and the compressed message itself can consist of up to 140 octets in total.\nWhen a mobile terminated message is class 0 and the MS has the capability of displaying short messages, the MS shall display the message immediately and send an acknowledgement to the SC when the message has successfully reached the MS irrespective of whether there is memory available in the (U)SIM or ME. The message shall not be automatically stored in the (U)SIM or ME.\nThe ME may make provision through MMI for the user to selectively prevent the message from being displayed immediately.\nIf the ME is incapable of displaying short messages or if the immediate display of the message has been disabled through MMI then the ME shall treat the short message as though there was no message class, i.e. it will ignore bits 0 and 1 in the TP-DCS and normal rules for memory capacity exceeded shall apply.\nWhen a mobile terminated message is Class 1, the MS shall send an acknowledgement to the SC when the message has successfully reached the MS and can be stored. The MS shall normally store the message in the ME by default, if that is possible, but otherwise the message may be stored elsewhere, e.g. in the (U)SIM. The user may be able to override the default meaning and select their own routing.\nWhen a mobile terminated message is Class 2 ((U)SIM-specific), an  MS shall ensure that the message has been transferred to the SMS data field in the (U)SIM before sending an acknowledgement to the SC. The MS shall return a \"protocol error, unspecified\" error message (see 3GPP TS 24.011 [6]) if the short message cannot be stored in the (U)SIM and there is other short message storage available at the MS. If all the short message storage at the MS is already in use, the MS shall return \"memory capacity exceeded\". This behaviour applies in all cases except for an  MS supporting (U)SIM Application Toolkit when the Protocol Identifier (TP-PID) of the mobile terminated message is set to \"(U)SIM Data download\" (see 3GPP TS 23.040 [4]).\nWhen a mobile terminated message is Class 3, the MS shall send an acknowledgement to the SC when the message has successfully reached the MS and can be stored, irrespectively of whether the MS supports an SMS interface to a TE, and without waiting for the message to be transferred to the TE. Thus the acknowledgement to the SC of a TE-specific message does not imply that the message has reached the TE. Class 3 messages shall normally be transferred to the TE when the TE requests \"TE‑specific\" messages (see 3GPP TS 27.005 [8]). The user may be able to override the default meaning and select their own routing.\nThe message class codes may also be used for mobile originated messages, to provide an indication to the destination SME of how the message was handled at the MS.\nThe MS will not interpret reserved or unsupported values but shall store them as received. The SC may reject messages with a Data Coding Scheme containing a reserved value or one which is not supported.",

USSD messages using the default alphabet are coded with the GSM 7-bit default alphabet given in clause 6.2.1. The message can then consist of up to 182 user characters.\nCell Broadcast messages using the default alphabet are coded with the GSM 7-bit default alphabet given in clause 6.2.1.

The General notes specified in clause 6.1.1 override any contrary specification in UCS2, so for example even in UCS2 a <CR> character will cause the MS to return to the beginning of the current line and overwrite any existing text with the characters which follow the <CR>.

To avoid the situation where the receiving entity confuses 7 binary zero pad bits as the @ character, the carriage return or <CR> character (defined in clause 6.1.1) shall be used for padding in this situation, just as for Cell Broadcast.\nIf <CR> is intended to be the last character and the message (including the wanted <CR>) ends on an octet boundary, then another <CR> must be added together with a padding bit 0. The receiving entity will perform the carriage return function twice, but this will not result in misoperation as the definition of <CR> in clause 6.1.1 is identical to the definition of <CR><CR>.\nThe receiving entity shall remove the final <CR> character where the message ends on an octet boundary with <CR> as the last character.",

Both single shift and locking shift mechanisms are defined.\nThe single shift mechanism, as defined in subclause 6.2.1.2.2, applies to a single character and it replaces the GSM 7 bit default alphabet extension table defined in subclause 6.2.1.1 with a National Language Single Shift Table (see subclause A.2).\nThe locking shift mechanism, as defined in subclause 6.2.1.2.3, applies throughout the message, or the current segment in case of a concatenated message, and it replaces the GSM 7 bit default alphabet defined in subclause 6.2.1 with a National Language Locking Shift Table (see subclause A.3) that defines the whole character set needed for the language.\nIn case that several languages are used, which require different national language tables, it is recommended to encode the message in UCS-2, however it is possible to use both single shift and locking shift with the corresponding tables in a single message.\nImplementations based on older reference versions (so-called \"legacy implementations\") will use the fallback mechanisms that are defined in the earlier versions of the specification for handling of unknown characters.",

This is because a receiving entity not supporting the relevant locking-shift decoding will present different characters from the ones intended by the sending entity.\nNOTE 3:\tAn SMS message using a locking shift table for a language may not be properly displayed when the terminal does not support the locking shift table for that language.

A receiving entity which does not understand the meaning of this escape mechanism shall display it as a space character.\nAnnex C (Informative):Example for locking shift and single shift mechanisms\nC.1\tIntroduction\nThis annex gives an overview on how the national language extension mechanism of the GSM 7 bit default alphabet works. This annex shows how a message with an indication of the Turkish National Language Identifier is decoded, but the same principles apply to other languages.\nC.2\tExample of single shift\nThis example outlines the behaviour of both supporting and non-supporting receiving entities where the Turkish National Language Single Shift Table is indicated in the received message. In this example there is no locking shift mechanism used in parallel.\nA non-supporting receiving entity will ignore the National Language Single Shift IE, and decode the message contents using the GSM 7 bit default alphabet table defined in subclause 6.2.1, including possible escape characters to the GSM 7 bit default alphabet extension table specified in subclause 6.2.1.1. For example the Turkish word \"Türkçe\" will be displayed as \"Türkce\".\nA receiving entity that supports the Turkish National Language Single Shift Table will detect a National Language Single Shift IE in a TP User Data Header. This IE tells the receiving entity that the single shift mechanism is used.\nA supporting receiving entity will notice the language code, in this example coded as '0000 0001', and therefore use the Turkish National Language Single Shift Table defined in subclause A.2.1 instead of the GSM 7 bit default alphabet extension table defined in subclause 6.2.1.\nIf the next character is any character except <escape>, then the GSM 7 bit default alphabet table is used for the decode. If the next character is <escape> then the Turkish language specific table is used for the decode of the one character that follows the <escape>. This process will be repeated until the end of the received message, or until the end of the current segment of a concatenated message.\nThe Language selection at the start of a message takes 4 octets which correspond to five 7 bit characters which reduces the maximum number of characters per single message to 155.\nThereafter, the number of characters within that single message will be dependent upon the number of times a character is used that is within the National Language Single Shift Table.\nEvery character used from the National Language Single Shift Table will need an additional character to identify the escape to the National Language Single Shift Table. The available 155 character capacity of a single message will therefore be reduced accordingly. This reduction of overall message length also applies when using characters from the GSM 7 bit default alphabet extension table (see subclause 6.2.1.1) when the National Language Single Shift IE is not used.\nC.3\tExample of locking shift\nThis example outlines the behaviour of both supporting and non-supporting receiving entities where the Turkish National Language Locking Shift Table is indicated in the received message.\nA non-supporting receiving entity will ignore the National Language Locking Shift IE, and decode the message contents using the GSM 7 bit default alphabet defined in subclause 6.2.1, including possible escape characters to the GSM 7 bit default alphabet extensions specified in subclause 6.2.1.1.\nA receiving entity that supports the scheme will detect a National Language Locking Shift IE in a TP User Data Header. This IE tells the receiving entity that the locking shift mechanism is used. If no National Language Single Shift IE is indicated additionally to the National Language Locking Shift IE, then the whole message is decoded using the National Language Locking Shift Table defined for Turkish language in subclause 6.2.1.2.4.1.\nIf, in addition  to the National Language Locking Shift IE (which may be for Turkish or another language),  a National Language Single Shift IE for the Turkish language is indicated, then <escape> makes an exception to the use of the National Language Locking Shift Table for the Turkish or another language. In that case a character following <escape> is decoded using the National Language Single Shift Table for the Turkish language, after which the use of the National Language Locking Shift Table for the Turkish or another language is resumed until the next <escape> or the end of the message is met.\nThe Language selection at the start of a message takes 4 octets which corresponds to five 7 bit characters which reduces the maximum number of characters per single message to 155, unless the National Language Single Shift IE has also been included, in which case there is a further reduction of 3 octets making 7 octets in total, which corresponds to eight 7 bit characters, which reduces the maximum number of characters per single message to 152.\nThereafter, if the single shift mechanism is used additionally to the locking shift mechanism, the number of characters within that single message will be dependent upon the number of times a character is used that is within the National Language Single Shift Table.\nEvery character in the National Language Single Shift Table will use an additional character. The available 152 character single message length will therefore be reduced accordingly. This reduction of overall message length also applies when using characters from the GSM 7 bit default alphabet extension table (see subclause 6.2.1.1) when the National Language Single Shift IE is not used.\nAnnex D (informative):Document change history\nTSG#\nTDoc\nVERS\nNEW_VERS\nCR\nREV\nRel\nCAT\nWORK ITEM\nSUBJECT\nT#4\n3.0.0\nNew\nCreation of 3GPP TS 23.038 v1.0.0 out of GSM 03.38 v7.1.0\nT#4\nTP-99124\n3.0.0\n3.1.0\n001\nR99\nA\nMExE\nData Coding Scheme for WAP over USSD and CB\nT#5\nTP-99177\n3.1.0\n3.2.0\n002\nR99\nB\nTEI\nLanguage codes for Hebrew,Arabic and Russian\nT#6\nTP-99237\n3.2.0\n3.3.0\n003\nR99\nF\nTEI\nAdaptations for UMTS\nT#8\nTP-000074\n3.3.0\n4.0.0\n004\nRel4\nB\nTEI\nAutomatic removal of ‘read’ SMS\nT#10\nTP-000195\n4.0.0\n4.1.0\n005\nRel4\nB\nTEI\nData coding scheme value for the Icelandic language\nT#11\nTP-010029\n4.1.0\n4.2.0\n006\nRel4\nC\nUICC1-CPHS\nMessage Waiting Indication Status storage on the USIM\nT#13\nTP-010194\n4.2.0\n4.3.0\n007\nRel4\nF\nTEI4\nSupport to UCS2 and editorial corrections\nT#14\nTP-010280\n4.3.0\n4.4.0\n008\nRel4\nF\nTEI4\nDeletion of GSM 01.04 reference\nT#15\nTP-020015\n4.4.0\n5.0.0\n009\nRel5\nF\nTEI5\nUser Data Header support over CBS\nT#21\nTP-030173\n5.0.0\n6.0.0\n010\nRel6\nC\nTEI6\nAdditional Indications in SMS DCS\nT#25\nTP-040205\n6.0.0\n6.1.0\n013\n2\nRel6\nF\nTEI6\nMessage Waiting Indication – how to handle Multiple Subscriber Profiles\nT#25\nTP-040171\n6.0.0\n6.1.0\n014\nRel6\nF\nTEI6\nEnhanced Voice Mail Information – not applicable for CBS\nCT#31\nCP-060126\n6.1.0\n7.0.0\n015r1\nRel-7\nF\nTEI7\nCBS – Reference removal\nCT-39\nCP-080223\n7.0.0\n8.0.0\n0017\n5\nRel-8\nB\nTEI8\nSMS default alphabet.
