      "content": "As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [8] and 3GPP TS 29.500 [4], the access to the Nmbsf_MBSUserDataIngestSession API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol (see IETF RFC 6749 [9]), based on local configuration, using the \"Client Credentials\" authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510 [10]) plays the role of the authorization server.\nIf OAuth2 is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming services offered by the Nmbsf_MBSUserDataIngestSession API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the authorization server, by invoking the Access Token Request service, as described in 3GPP TS 29.510 [10], clause 5.4.2.2.\nNOTE:\tWhen multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for discovering the Nmbsf_MBSUserDataIngestSession service.\nThe Nmbsf_MBSUserDataIngestSession API defines a single scope \"nmbsf-mbs-ud-ingest\" for the entire service, and it does not define any additional scopes at resource or operation level.\nAnnex A (normative):OpenAPI specification\nA.1\tGeneral\nThis Annex specifies the formal definition of the API(s) defined in the present specification.
