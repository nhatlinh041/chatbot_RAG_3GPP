The group can have multiple MCPTT clients, but only one MCPTT client involved in the session is shown for simplicity.\nThe procedure takes place prior to the establishment of a group call to the pre-configured group regroup.\nIn this procedure, any gateway MC servers between the IWF and the MCPTT system are not shown.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tThe MCPTT client is an affiliated member of MCPTT group 1 where MCPTT group 1 is defined in the MCPTT system.\n-\tThe MCPTT group identity and group configuration for the pre-configured group regroup have been pre-configured in the MCPTT client, and the MCPTT client has received the relevant security related information to allow communication in the pre-configured group regroup.\n-\tThe pre-configured group regroup is homed in the IWF.\n-\tThe MCPTT system is home to at least one group that's a constituent group of the pre-configured group regroup.\nNOTE 1:\tThe MCPTT system has the configuratiton information contained in the pre-configured group, which is normally because at least one member of the preconfigured group is homed on the MCPTT system.\nFigure 10.3.7.2.2-1: Regroup procedure using pre-configured group initiated in the IWF\n1.\tThe IWF initiates the pre-configured group regroup procedure, specifying the list of MCPTT groups to be regrouped including MCPTT group 1, the MCPTT group ID of the pre-configured group regroup and the MCPTT group ID of the group from which configuration information for the pre-configured group regroup is to be taken.

If available, the LMR party homed in the IWF may also include a functional alias. The following parameters are also included that describe the IWF's choices:\n-\tthe encryption algorithm;\n-\tthe encryption mode (encrypted or not)\n-\tan indication of whether the LMR user is requesting the floor, and if the MCPTT client is requesting the floor, location information of the calling MCPTT client may be provided;\n-\trequested commencement mode (manual in this case); and\n-\tan indication of whether the call is to be full or half duplex (whether to establish floor control).\n2.\tThe MCPTT server checks whether the MCPTT user at the MCPTT client is authorized and able to receive the private call. Because the IWF private call request is requesting manual commencement mode, the MCPTT server also checks whether the MCPTT user at the MCPTT client is authorized to receive a call in manual commencement mode. The MCPTT server also checks whether the provided functional alias, if present, can be used and has been activated for the LMR user homed in the IWF.\n3.\tIf authorized, the MCPTT server sends the MCPTT private call request towards the MCPTT client, including the original parameters with or without the location of the calling party and offering the same media types or a subset of the media types contained in the initial received request as per 3GPP TS 23.379 [7].\nNOTE 3:\tHow the IWF private call request is forwarded to the LMR system is out of scope of the present document.\n4.\tThe MCPTT client may report failure with an MCPTT private call response to the MCPTT server. The response may include one or more alternatives to the parameter values contained in step 3. If the MCPTT client does not report failure, the process proceeds with step 6.\n5.\tThe MCPTT server forwards the MCPTT private call response to the IWF. If the result parameter indicates failure, the IWF may abandon the call. If the parameters in the IWF private call response are acceptable to the IWF, then the IWF can send a new IWF private call request with the new parameters to the MCPTT server and behaves according to those parameters. The IWF may choose to end the call rather than continue with the new parameters.\n6.\tThe MCPTT client sends an MCPTT ringing to the MCPTT server while waiting for the call to be accepted by the MCPTT user.\n7.\tThe MCPTT server sends an IWF ringing to IWF the while waiting for the call to be accepted.\n8.\tOnce the call has been accepted by the called user, the MCPTT client sends an MCPTT private call response to the MCPTT server. The IWF private call response indicates that the IWF does support one of the requested media types.\n9.\tThe MCPTT sends the IWF private call response to the IWF.\n10.\tThe MCPTT client has successfully established media plane for communication to the IWF. The LMR system initiating the call is responsible of granting the floor, solving competing floor requests and issuing floor revoked indications.",

Within the context of interworking between MCPTT and LMR systems, this condition can occur due to both MCPTT and LMR users obtaining the floor simultaneously, or the floor granted to an LMR user is taken by an MCPTT user.\nFigure 10.5.4‑1 shows the high-level procedure where an MCPTT session is already established between the floor participants (with floor granted to an LMR user represented by the IWF) and the floor control server (with an override based on priority and configured to permit the transmission of overridden floor participant from the IWF). The group is defined in the MCPTT system and the MCPTT Server is the floor control server. Only two UEs involved in the session are shown for simplicity.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe MCPTT floor control server has been configured to support override.\n2.\tThe override supported in this case permits both the overridden floor participant and the overriding floor participant to be transmitting.\n3.\tAn MCPTT session is established between an MCPTT client, the interworked system, and MCPTT server.\n4.\tSession is ongoing.\nFigure 10.5.4‑1: Floor override (overridden continues to transmit) during an interworking session\n1.\tIt is assumed that the floor participant B (represented by the IWF in figure 10.5.4‑1) has been given the floor and is transmitting voice media.\n2.\tFloor participant A, having a floor priority which is relatively higher than that of floor participant B, wants to send voice media over the session.\n3.\tFloor participant A sends a floor request message to the floor control server.\n4.\tThe floor control server determines to accept the floor request from floor participant A based on arbitration result e.g., according to the floor priority information that is received in the floor request message.\n5a.\tFloor control server responds with a floor granted message to floor participant A.\n5b.\tFloor control server sends a floor taken message to the other floor participants (via the IWF).

The MCPTT client sends an MCPTT first-to-answer call request towards the MCPTT server. The MCPTT first-to-answer call request contains the MCPTT ID corresponding to the calling MCPTT party and called LMR party, and an SDP offer containing one or more media types. The called LMR party can consist of a set of potential target recipients represented by their MCPTT IDs, or a functional alias. The following parameters are also included that describe the MCPTT client's choices:\n-\tthe encryption algorithm;\n-\tthe encryption mode (encrypted or not);\n-\tan indication of whether the MCPTT client is requesting the floor, and if the MCPTT client is requesting the floor, and\n-\tan indication of whether the call is to be full or half duplex (whether to establish floor control).\n2.\tThe MCPTT server checks whether the MCPTT user at the MCPTT client is authorized to initiate the first-to-answer call. The MCPTT server checks whether the provided functional alias of the calling user, if present, can be used and has been activated for the MCPTT user.\n3.\tIf authorized, the MCPTT server sends the IWF first-to-answer call request that may or may not include location of the requestor, depending on the outcome of the privacy check towards the IWF, including the original parameters and offering the same media types or a subset of the media types contained in the initial received request as per 3GPP TS 23.379 [7].\nNOTE:\tHow the IWF first-to-answer call request is forwarded to the LMR system is out of scope of the present document.\n4.\tThe IWF sends an IWF first-to-answer call response to the MCPTT server, indicating that the IWF does support one of the requested media types.

If the result parameter indicates success, then the MCPTT client proceeds to step 6. Otherwise, if the parameters returned in the MCPTT first-to-answer call response are acceptable to the MCPTT client, then the MCPTT client can send a new MCPTT first-to-answer call request with the new parameters and behaves according to those parameters. The calling MCPTT user may be notified of the change in parameters, for example, that the call is to be without floor control. The MCPTT user can choose to end the call rather than continue with the new parameters. If the parameters returned are not acceptable to the MCPTT client, then the call fails.\n6.\tThe MCPTT client has successfully established media plane for communication to the IWF and either end can transmit media.
