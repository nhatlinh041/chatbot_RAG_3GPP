      "content": "The present document contains the stage 2 service description for a High Speed Circuit Switched Data (HSCSD) on GSM/GERAN in A/Gb mode and Iu mode. HSCSD utilizes the multislot mechanism, i.e. using multiple traffic channels (/bearers) for the communication.\nAdditionally, the present document specifies some HSCSD related requirements for multi system mobile stations operating in UTRAN Iu mode. In UTRAN Iu mode one bearer can provide all needed data rates, and the multislot mechanism is therefore not needed. However, for inter-system handover to GERAN, certain information has to be provided by the mobile station during the service negotiation. The UTRAN Iu mode aspects concerning HSCSD are described exclusively in clause 4.2.\nIn analogy with ITU-T Recommendation I.130 [6] (refer to annex A) and with reference of ITU-T Recommendation Q.65 [7] VI.1 (Stage 2 of the method for characterization of services supported by an ISDN), the second stage of the HSCSD is defined as follows.\nStage 2 identifies the functional capabilities and information flows needed to support the service as described in  3GPP TS 22.034 [9]. Furthermore, it identifies various possible physical locations for the functional capabilities. The output of Stage 2, which is signalling system independent, is used as an input to Stage 3, the design of signalling system and switching Recommendations.\nThe present document specifies functions, procedures and information which apply to GERAN Iu mode. However, functionality related to GERAN Iu mode is neither maintained nor enhanced.",

      "content": "The air interface user rate in the original GSM data transmission is limited to 9,6 kbps with the 12 kbps air interface rate. The HSCSD described in the present document Stage 2 description allows higher air interface user rates to be used for transparent and non-transparent data services.\nNOTE:\tIn the present document the term \"air interface user rate\" corresponds to the transfer rate in radio interface for user data and \"air interface rate\" includes additional data related to transmission protocols.\nHSCSD is a feature enabling the co-allocation of multiple full rate traffic channels (TCH/F) into a HSCSD configuration. The aim of HSCSD is to provide a mixture of services with different air interface user rates by a single physical layer structure. Further improvements in data rates are achieved through enhancement of the radio interface (modulation and coding schemes), which allows higher bit rates per one GSM time slot. The available capacity of a HSCSD configuration is several times the capacity of a TCH/F, leading to a significant enhancement in the air interface data transfer rate.\nFigure 1 represents the network architecture to support HSCSD in A/Gb mode based on the concept of multiple independent channels in one HSCSD configuration. Figure 1a represents the network architecture to support HSCSD in GERAN Iu mode.\nNOTE:\t3GPP TS 43.051 [18] does not specify the GERAN internal interface between BSC and BTS.\nIn case when enhanced modulation is used the number of time slots in the radio interface may not correspond to the number of data streams in the network side, for example a 28,8 kbps service may be offered through one air interface time slot, but it requires two 14,4 (16 kbps) Abis channels. Another example is bit transparent 56 kbps to 64 kbps service where two air interface time slots of 32 kbps are multiplexed onto one 64 kbps data stream on the network side.\nFigure 1: Network architecture for supporting HSCSD in A/Gb mode\nFigure 1a: Network architecture for supporting HSCSD in GERAN Iu mode\nA new functionality is introduced at the network and MS to provide the functions of combining and splitting the data into separate data streams which will then be transferred via n channels at the radio interface, where n = 1, 2, 3, ... 8. Once split, the data streams shall be carried by the n full rate traffic channels, called HSCSD channels, as if they were independent of each other, for the purpose of data relay and radio interface L1 error control, until to the point in the network where they are combined. However, logically the n full rate traffic channels at the radio interface belong to the same HSCSD configuration, and therefore they shall be controlled as one radio link by the network for the purpose of cellular operations, e.g. handover. This requires a new functionality in BSS.\nThe different user data substreams carried on the radio channels (one substream being the data flow over a single TCH) shall be mapped over the A interface or GERAN Iu interface, and vice versa, following the rules defined in 3GPP TS 24.008 [3] and 3GPP TS 48.020 [12].\nIn A/Gb mode, the use of resources on the A and E interfaces is restricted to one 64 kbps circuit by multiplexing the data streams into one A interface circuit (see ITU‑T Recommendation I.460 [8]).\nIn GERAN Iu mode, the user plane at the Iu interface shall comply to the Iu UP protocol (3GPP TS 25.415 [20]). For transparent calls the Iu user plane is operated in transparent mode, version 1, for non-transparent calls it is operated in support mode for predefined SDU sizes, version 2.\nAfter an inter-MSC SRNS relocation the user plane between the anchor MSC or MGW and the target MSC or MGW shall comply to the Nb UP protocol (3GPP TS 29.415 [22]), if the anchor MSC or MGW and the target MSC or MGW are connected via an ATM interface or IP interface. The NbUP shall be configured in support mode, the data is transported in a 64 kbit/s bit stream (for details see 3GPP TS 29.007 [23]).\nIf both MSCs are connected via a TDM interface the use of resources on the E interface is restricted to one 64 kbps circuit (see 3GPP TS 29.007 [23]).",

      "content": "At call setup a user indicates a maximum number of TCH/F, acceptable channel codings (including extensions to acceptable channel codings for ECSD channel codings), possible other modem type, and fixed network user rate values. For non-transparent HSCSD connection, in addition, wanted air interface user rate is indicated and the network resource needs, if user wishes to make use of the user initiated modification of the maximum number of TCH/F and/or wanted air interface user rate (user initiated service level up- and downgrading described in subclauses 5.2.4 and 5.2.4a) during the call. In case the indicated acceptable channel coding(s) implies that enhanced modulation is possible, the user may indicate a preference for channel coding asymmetry, i.e. downlink biased channel coding asymmetry, uplink biased channel coding asymmetry or channel coding symmetry. Together these parameters describe the HSCSD characteristics and network uses them to allocate an appropriate HSCSD connection.\nFor both transparent and non-transparent HSCSD connections the call can be established with any number of TCH/F from one up to the maximum number of TCH/F, i.e. the minimum channel requirement is always one TCH/F.\nIf the wanted air interface user rate requirement cannot be met using a symmetric configuration, an asymmetric configuration can be chosen. The network shall in this case give priority to fulfilling the air interface user rate requirement in downlink direction.\nFor non-transparent HSCSD connection the network can use dynamic allocation of resources, i.e. TCH/F, as long as the configuration is not in contradiction with the limiting values defined by the MS and the mobile equipment is capable of handling the allocated channel configuration. For transparent HSCSD connection the dynamic resource allocation is applicable, if the air interface user rate is kept constant. The change of channel configuration within the limits of minimum and maximum channel requirements is done with resource upgrading and resource downgrading procedures (described in subclauses 5.2.3 and 5.2.3a) during the call.\nThe MS may request a service level up- or downgrading during the call, if so negotiated in the beginning of the call. In the user initiated modification procedure, the user can modify the channel coding asymmetry preference when enhanced modulation is indicated. This modification of channel requirements and/or wanted air interface user rate and/or channel coding asymmetry preference is applicable to non-transparent HSCSD connections only.",

      "content": "The HSCSD configuration is a multislot configuration using the TCH/F data channel mapping described in 3GPP TS 45.002 [2].\nTwo types of HSCSD configurations exist, symmetric configuration and asymmetric configuration. For both types of configurations the channels may be allocated on either consecutive or non-consecutive time slots taking into account the restrictions defined by the classmark.\nAn example of the HSCSD operation with two consecutive time slots is shown in figure 2.\nFigure 2: Double slot operation in the air interface\nA symmetric HSCSD configuration consists of a bi-directional FACCH and co-allocated bi-directional TCH/F and SACCH channels. An asymmetric HSCSD configuration consists of a bi-direction FACCH and co-allocated uni‑directional or bi-directional TCH/F and SACCH channels. A bi-directional channel is a channel on which the data is transferred in both uplink and downlink directions. On uni-directional channels for HSCSD the data is transferred in downlink direction, only.\nIn both symmetric and asymmetric HSCSD configurations one bi-directional channel, the main channel, carries a FACCH used for all the signalling not carried on the SACCH(s).\nFor HSCSD configuration all SACCHs are synchronized so that idle frames for each time slot coincide.\nThe classification of mobile stations used for HSCSD shall be based on Multislot classes, described in detail in 3GPP TS 45.002 [2]. Further classification shall be based on the Mobile Station Classmark depending on the supported modulations.\nThe same frequency hopping sequence and training sequence is used for all the channels in the HSCSD configuration.\nThe same channel coding is used for all the channels in the HSCSD configuration, though in the enhanced modulation mode, for non-transparent services, it is possible to have one channel coding used in the downlink and another channel coding used in the uplink. Different channel codings for up- and downlink could be applied in three cases, see 3GPP TS 22.034 [9]:\na)\tIf the mobile station only supports enhanced modulation in the downlink direction.\nb)\tIf the mobile station supports enhanced modulation in both directions, but the user indicates preference for uplink or downlink biased channel coding asymmetry.\nc)\tIf the mobile station supports enhanced modulation in both directions, and the user indicates preference for channel coding symmetry, but the link conditions justifies different channel coding in uplink or downlink.\nFor Mobile Stations supporting 8-PSK modulation additional channel codings shall apply. The change between different TCH/F channel codings can be provided in A/Gb mode with the RR Channel Mode Modify or the Configuration Change procedure, and in GERAN Iu mode with the Radio Bearer Reconfiguration procedure. It shall be possible to change between channel codings of different modulation schemes.\nIn symmetric HSCSD configuration individual signal level and quality reporting for each HSCSD channel is applied.\nFor an asymmetric HSCSD configuration individual signal level and quality reporting is used for those channels, which have uplink SACCH associated with them. The quality measurements reported on the main channel are based on the worst quality measured among the main and the uni-directional downlink time slots used.\nIn both symmetric and asymmetric HSCSD configuration the neighbouring cell measurement reports are copied on every uplink channel used. See 3GPP TS 45.008 [15] for more detail on signal level and quality reporting.\nIn A/Gb mode, separate ciphering keys are used for each HSCSD channels. The ciphering keys used on different channels are derived from the Kc. See 3GPP TS 43.020 [10] for more details. In GERAN Iu mode, the same ciphering architecture is used as in UTRAN Iu mode. See 3GPP TS 43.051 [18] and 3GPP TS 33.102 [24] for more details.",

Based on these parameters and operator preferences the BSC then allocates a suitable number of channels and a suitable channel coding for the connection.\nThe following rule for the channel allocation apply:\n-\tThe BSS shall try to reach but not exceed, with one exception, the wanted AIUR. The exception is the case when the chosen configuration can reach the wanted AIUR with lower number of TCH/F, e.g. in case AIUR=14,4 kbit/s, max number of TCH/F=3, ACC=TCH/F4.8 and TCH/F9.6, the network shall choose 2 x 9,6 over 3 x 4,8 if the TCH/F9.6 is available in the cell.\n-\tA separate channel activation is applied for each of the HSCSD channels before the selected channel configuration with information of the channel coding is forwarded to the mobile station. When the preference for downlink or uplink biased channel coding asymmetry is indicated by the user, and an asymmetric channel coding connection is set up based on this indication, the BSC shall always assign a TCH/F14.4 channel on the unbiased link of the connection.\n-\tAt assignment completion, the BSS informs the MSC of the chosen HSCSD configuration and the MSC may seize the IW resources accordingly.\n5.2.1.1a\tMobile originated call establishment (GERAN Iu mode)\nFigure 3a depicts the procedures for a successful HSCSD call establishment in mobile originated case in GERAN Iu mode.\nThe MS GERAN Iu mode radio access capabilities, including the multislot capabilities of the MS, are sent from the MS to the network during the establishment of the RRC connection.\nThe BSC includes the GERAN classmark in the RANAP Initial UE message to inform the MSC about the BSS capabilities of the serving cell:\n-\tAcceptable Channel Codings, ACC (including ACC ext.); and\n-\tmaximum number of traffic channels, Max TCH/F.\nThe parameters in the Setup message and their presence requirements for transparent (T) and non-transparent (NT) calls are the same as for A/Gb mode, however, for non-transparent calls in GERAN Iu mode the channel coding asymmetry indication will be ignored. When negotiating the parameters for a transparent call, the MSC shall take the GERAN classmark into account.\nFigure 3a: Mobile originated call establishment (GERAN Iu mode)\nThe MSC requests the BSC to allocate a radio access bearer by sending a RANAP RAB Assignment Request message. The RAB parameters in this message are set according to the parameters negotiated between MS and MSC and the GERAN classmark of the serving cell. For non-transparent calls the RAB parameters contain the description of all RAB subflow combinations allowable for the maximum bit rate at the Iu interface, and thus for the maximum possible AIUR that can be allocated by the BSC for this call.\nAdditionally, the MSC includes a GERAN BSC container, indicating the Max TCH/F allowed and the Allowed radio interface data rates. In this version, the MSC shall indicate only one radio interface data rate as allowed.\nBased on these parameters and operator preferences the BSC then allocates a suitable number of channels for the allowed channel coding.\nAfter the successful setup of the radio access bearer, for non-transparent calls the BSC initiates the Iu user plane protocol. In the Iu UP initialisation message the first RAB subflow combination proposed in the list of RAB subflow combinations indicates the RAB subflow combination and thus the AIUR to be used by the IW function when starting the communication phase (see 3GPP TS 25.415 [20]).
