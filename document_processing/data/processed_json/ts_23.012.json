This is to be distinguished from the corresponding protocol handling behaviour, which is specified in 3GPP TS 29.002 [8]. The following location management procedures are included:\n-\tlocation updating;\n-\tlocation cancellation;\n-\tMS purging;\n-\tIMSI attach/detach.\nThe procedures in the Mobile Station (MS) are described in 3GPP TS 23.022 [6]. The procedures between MSC, VLR and HLR utilise the Mobile Application Part (MAP) and details concerning the protocol handling are contained in 3GPP TS 29.002 [8].\nThe present document excludes location management procedures for the packet switched domain, which are covered in 3GPP TS 23.060 [20].\nThe descriptions herein depict a logical separation between the MSC and VLR. This logical separation, as well as the messages transferred between the two logical entities are the basis of a model used to define the externally visible behaviour of the MSC/VLR, which a may be a single physical entity. They do not impose any requirement except the definition of the externally visible behaviour.",

      "content": "General comment: at any stage in the location updating process the MSC may receive an indication from the BSS that the MM transaction has been released. The MSC then sends an Abort signal to the VLR. Upon receipt of this message, the VLR shall follow one of two possible courses of action.\nThe two possible courses of action and the conditions determining which course shall be taken are as follows:\n1.\tIf a successfully authenticated radio connection is already established before the Abort message is received, the VLR shall ignore the message.\n2.\tIf a successfully authenticated radio connection has not been established before the Abort message is received, the VLR shall abort the Update Location Area process and return to the idle state.\nSheet 1: the location area updating process will be activated by receiving an Update Location Area indication from the MSC. If there are parameter errors in the indication, the process is terminated with the appropriate error sent in the Update Location Area response to the MSC. Else, the behaviour will depend on the subscriber identity received, either an IMSI or a TMSI.\nThe Automatic Device Detection (ADD) function is an optional feature that allows the HLR to be updated with the current User Equipment (IMEISV) and thus enables the network to configure the subscriber's equipment based on a predefined profile. The mechanism for the IMEISV retrieval by device management system (either from HLR or VLR) is outside the scope of this specification. As an optimisation, the VLR may optionally store whether or not the HLR supports the ADD feature and use this information to decide whether or not to send an update to the HLR.\nThe Paging Area function is an optional feature that allows the HLR to be updated with the current Paging Area (PgA) (see clause 2.6). If supported, whenever the paging area changes, the VLR shall send a MAP Update Location request with the Paging Area parameter set to the location areas belonging to the new paging area.  The Paging Area is then sent by the HLR (if available) to the VLR in the MAP Provide Roaming Number and may be used for paging optimisation after a MSC/VLR restart (see 3GPP TS 23.018 [5a]).\nSheet 1: The usage of a Hop Counter is an optional optimization.\nSheet 2: at the decision \"HLR updating required?\" the \"True\" branch shall be taken if and only if one or more of the following conditions is true:\n(1) Location Info Confirmed in HLR is false.\n(2) Data Confirmed by HLR is false.\nSheet 2: : The execution of the test \"HLR supports ADD?\" and the action \"set: skip subscriber data update\" is an optional optimisation and depends on the presence of the relevant indication from the HLR that ADD functionality is supported. If this optimisation is not supported on the VLR or no indication is received, both are bypassed in which case processing continues at connector 4.\nSheet 2: The execution of the test \"HLR supports PgA?\" and the action \"set: skip subscriber data update\" depends on the presence of the relevant indication from the HLR that PgA functionality is supported.\nSheet 2: The \"Subscriber data dormant\" flag is an optional parameter that shall at least be supported by VLR implementing the Mobile Terminating Roaming Retry feature (see 3GPP TS 23.018 [5a]). A VLR not supporting this flag shall behave as if the flag is set to false.\nSheet 2: A VLR supporting the Mobile Terminating Roaming Retry feature sets the \"Cancel Location received\" flag to false after authenticating the radio connection. This is used to determine whether to trigger MT roaming retry upon receipt of an incoming call, see clause 7.3.2.1 of 3GPP TS 23.018 [5a].\nSheet 3: the procedure Obtain_IMSI_VLR is specified in 3GPP TS 23.018 [5a].\nThe type of Location Update is retrieved in 3GPP TS 23.078 [11] procedure 'Set_Notification_Type' and is returned into the 'Notify' variable; this information is necessary for the CAMEL Mobility Management event notification procedure 3GPP TS 23.078 [11] 'Notify_gsmSCF'.\nFigure 4.1.2.1 (sheet 1 of 3): Process Update_Location_Area_VLR\nFigure 4.1.2.1 (sheet 2 of 3): Process Update_Location_Area_VLR\nFigure 4.1.2.1 (sheet 3 of 3): Process Update_Location_Area_VLR\nFigure 4.1.2.1 (sheet 4 of 4): Process Update_Location_Area_VLR\n4.1.2.1a\tProcedure Retrieve_IMEISV_If_Required\nThe decision box \"received IMEISV = stored IMEISV\" takes the \"No\" exit if no IMEISV is stored.\nFigure 4.1.2.1A: Procedure Retrieve_IMEISV_If_Required",

The \"Yes\" branch results in the sending of \"Update Location Area Negative Response\" toward the MSC (and the MS), with cause \"National Roaming Not Allowed.\" However, subscriber data shall not be deleted from the VLR. This is to avoid unnecessary HLR updating should the subscriber be allowed subsequently to roam in other LAs of the same MSC.\nSheet 1: Decision \"Access-Restriction-Data permits current RAT?\" performs a check on the subscriber's AccessRestrictionData information received from the HLR and either allows the operation to continue or rejects the Location Update. The decision is taken according to the following:\n-If AccessRestrictionData value includes \"GERAN not allowed\" and the LA/RA, where the MS accesses the network, is served by GERAN, then the subscriber's access is not permitted.\n-If AccessRestrictionData value includes \"UTRAN not allowed\" and the LA/RA, where the MS accesses the network is served by UTRAN, then the subscriber's access is not permitted.\nSheet 1: When the Location Update is not allowed because the subscriber access is restricted due to Administrative Restriction of Subscribers' Access feature, the flow results in the sending of \"Update Location Area Negative Response\" toward the MSC (and the MS). The recommended cause code is \"RAT not allowed\", but cause codes \"PLMN not allowed\" or \"National Roaming Not allowed\" may also be used based on operator configuration and the required MS behaviour.\nNote: For the mapping of MAP Process cause code values to values on the MM protocol interface see 3GPP TS 29.010 [14].\nFor the MS behaviour determined on the received cause code see 3GPP TS 24.008[13].\nSheet 1: Decision \"Roaming restriction due to Unsupported Feature received in subscriber data?\" distinguishes whether or not the subscriber data received from the HLR indicates \"roaming restriction due to unsupported feature.\" The \"Yes\" branch results in the sending of \"Update Location Area Negative Response\" toward the MSC (and the MS), with cause \"National Roaming Not Allowed.\" However, subscriber data shall not be deleted from the VLR. This is to avoid unnecessary HLR updating should the subscriber be allowed subsequently to roam in other LAs of the same MSC.\nSheet 1: Decision \"Regional subscription restriction\" distinguishes whether or not the subscriber is allowed service in the target LA, which the VLR deduces based on regional subscription information received from the HLR. The \"Yes\" branch results in the sending of \"Update Location Area Negative Response\" toward the MSC (and the MS), with cause \"location area not allowed.\" However, subscriber data shall not be deleted from the VLR. This is to avoid unnecessary HLR updating should the subscriber be allowed subsequently to roam in other LAs of the same MSC.\nSheet 1: Causes \"National Roaming Not Allowed\" and \"RAT not allowed\" lead to sending of cause #13 (roaming not allowed in the Location Area) and #15 (no suitable cells in Location Area) respectively to the MS (see 3GPP TS 29.010 [14]). On receipt of cause #13 or #15 the TMSI and LAI currently stored in the MS are not deleted (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [13]). As an option (referred-to as \"TMSI option\"), for these two reject causes, the VLR may forward a new TMSI (with the new LAI) together with the sending of \"Update Location Area Negative Response\" toward the MSC. The Location Updating Reject is sent to the MS after forwarding of the new TMSI (and new LAI) (see clause 4.1.1.1).\nThis optional TMSI allocation (with new LAI) ensures that:\n-\ta pre-Rel-8 MS will initiate a location updating if it roams back to the previous Location Area (allowed), i.e. to the  location area whose identity is already stored in the MS, after having received the reject cause #13 or #15; otherwise the location updating may not be initiated and mobile terminated calls may not be delivered until the next mobile originated activity or periodic location update (see 3GPP TR 29.994 [18]).\n-\tthe next location update enables the new VLR to address the correct previous VLR (which controls the not allowed Location Area) and to obtain the right IMSI and security context; otherwise a wrong VLR is addressed (corresponding to the TMSI/LAI of the VLR that controlled the previous allowed LA) and a wrong IMSI / security context would be obtained if the TMSI was reallocated.\nSheet 2: If the MS performs a location update procedure in a VPLMN supporting Autonomous CSG Roaming and the HPLMN has enabled Autonomous CSG Roaming in the VPLMN (via Service Level Agreement) and if the VLR needs to retrieve the CSG Subscription Data of the MS from the CSS, the VLR shall initiate the Update VCSG Location Procedure with the CSS and store the CSG Subscription data if any received from the CSS. The stored CSG Subscription data is used by VLR to perform access control for the MS.\nIf the Update VCSG Location Procedure fails, the VLR continues the location update procedure.\nSheet 3: The procedure Check_IMEI_VLR is specified in 3GPP TS 23.018 [5a].\nFigure 4.1.2.3 (sheet 1 of 3): Procedure Location_Update_Completion_VLR\nFigure 4.1.2.3 (sheet 2 of 3): Procedure Location_Update_Completion_VLR\nFigure 4.1.2.3 (sheet 3 of 3): Procedure Location_Update_Completion_VLR",

If no indication is received, then the result of the test is \"No\". The HLR may additionally skip the procedures Update_Routing_Info and Control_Tracing_HLR if this indication is received from the VLR.\nSheet 2: If the HLR supports the Administrative Restriction of Subscribers Access feature and roaming is allowed in the VPLMN then the HLR may check the \"Supported RAT Types\" received from the VLR against the access restriction parameters. If this check fails then the decision box \"Roaming allowed in this PLMN\" shall take the exit \"No\".\nSheet 2: If the HLR supports MSISDN-less subscriptions and the subscriber's subscription is MSISDN-less, the test \"Subscriber Allowed to Roam into PLMN?\" takes the \"no\" exit e.g. if the VLR is known not to support MSISDN-less operation (see clause 3.6.1.5).\nFigure 4.1.3.1 (sheet 1 of 3): Process Update_Location_HLR\nFigure 4.1.3.1 (sheet 2 of 3): Process Update_Location_HLR\nFigure 4.1.3.1 (sheet 3 of 3): Process Update_Location_HLR",
