      "content": "The main principle is that whenever a RAB is assigned for a PDP context (or re-assigned) the SGSN decides whether to use a direct user plane tunnel between RNC and GGSN, or, if it needs to handle user plane data and use two tunnels as in earlier 3GPP releases. Further, when a Direct Tunnel was in use and the RAB assigned for a PDP context is released (i.e. the PDP context is preserved) the GTP-U tunnel is (re)established between the GGSN and SGSN in order to be able to handle the downlink packets.\nThe SGSN needs to decide before every RAB assignment and every SRNS relocation if direct tunnel will be used or not.\nFigure 6-1: Connected mode and Idle mode handling\nIn the Intra SGSN Inter-system Change procedure from 3G to 2G, the SGSN needs to perform a PDP Context Update Procedure to establish the tunnel between the 2G SGSN and the GGSN and release the Direct Tunnel between RNC and GGSN.\nIn the Intra SGSN Inter-system Change procedure from 2G to 3G, the SGSN provides to the RNC the GGSN's Address(es) for User Plane and TEID(s) for Uplink data in the RAB Assignment Request during the Service Request Procedure. Then the SGSN performs a PDP Context Update Procedure to establish the Direct Tunnel between the RNC and the GGSN and release the tunnel between SGSN and GGSN.\nToggling between 2G and 3G might (or might not) be frequent. This may effect the Gn signalling when Direct Tunnel is deployed. It is implementation specific how this is addressed.",

      "content": "In order to inform the GGSN of the IP address of the RNC and the TEID for the active PDP context, the SGSN will send an Update PDP Context Request message to the GGSN during every PDP Context Activation procedure for which a Direct Tunnel is established. This message, which is an optional message in two-tunnel system, increases the signalling load on SGSN and GGSN.\nRAB release and re-establishment procedures, which become visible to the GGSN in a Direct Tunnel system, also increase the signalling load on SGSN and GGSN. If the radio-link is bad, and the RNC releases the Iu connection, the frequent RAB release and re-establishment increases the signalling load on SGSN and GGSN. One consequence is that it is useful if the RNC utilises URA-PCH state.\nSome Intra SGSN procedures, such as Intra SGSN inter RNC, Intra SGSN Inter-system change, and possibly other procedures, which are invisible to the GGSN in two-tunnel system, will become visible to the GGSN and increase the signalling load on both SGSN and GGSN.\nReceipt of the Direct Tunnel Indicator makes the GGSN aware that the SGSN is using a Direct Tunnel.\nWhen using Direct Tunnel, if the GGSN receives a GTP-U Error Indication (from the RNC) it shall not release the related PDP context locally but the GGSN shall notify the SGSN that the RAB in RAN is invalid. This needs the GGSN to be updated.\nNOTE:\tDuring a deployment phase, the Direct Tunnel feature may however be used without the GGSN being upgraded.

The risk could be reduced by using firewall between Iu-PS and Gn networks instead of simple router (this might impact user-plane latency). Only IP traffic to predefined IP-addresses/ports from predefined addresses/ports would be allowed between Iu-PS and Gn networks. Considering network security, a firewall can be deployed between the RNC and the IP network.\nFor an ATM based Iu-PS, the ATM connection needs to be terminated and \"interworked\" to IP. The location of the interworking may be within the Iu-PS network or at the edge of the Iu-PS network.\nFigure 6-2 shows the connectivity between the Iu-PS network and the Gn (backbone) network.\nFigure 6-2: Connectivity with Iu-PS",

This means that the Pre-DT GGSN marks the related PDP context as invalid without informing the SGSN. This may result in the PDP Context being deleted in the GGSN and, if the PDP context is the last context for that IP address, the release of the related IP address. When downlink data arrives at this GGSN, the GGSN will discard the data locally if no valid PDP context is found that is able to route the data (e.g. as dictated by allocated UE IP address or by packets filters belonging to installed TFTs). This means e.g. Push services will be blocked in this situation.\nIn the case that the GGSN marks the related PDP context as invalid, any effected PDP contexts that use Direct Tunnel and have an invalid tunnel in the GGSN will be recovered when the SGSN receives an Iu connection establishment request from the MS as specified in clause \"Handling of Un-synchronous States in the UE and the Network\" in TS 23.060 [1].
