This CTM indication should therefore be considered a mandatory terminal requirement.\n-\tAn indication from a mobile terminal that CTM detection/conversion is required will not result in any interworking issues if the indication is received by a network where all the transcoders are CTM capable or where a core network CTM-SRF solution has been chosen. This is because the indication is redundant in this case.\n-\tIf a subscriber, from a network where all the transcoders are CTM capable or a CTM circuit pooling solution has been adopted, roams to a network where a core network CTM-SRF solution has been chosen, then the subscriber will only receive CTM conversion for emergency calls. The reason is that the subscriber lacks the necessary subscription to a CAMEL service, which would route this normal call via a core network CTM-SRF.\n-\tIn the case where inter-MSC handover occurs between an MSC where all the transcoders are CTM capable or a CTM circuit pooling approach is in operation, and an MSC which relies on a core network CTM-SRF, then the subscriber will lose CTM conversion for all calls.\nIf a subscriber from a network where a core network CTM-SRF solution has been adopted roams to a network where all the transcoders are CTM capable or a CTM circuit pooling solution has been chosen, then the subscriber will receive CTM conversion for all calls. The presence of two CTM detection/conversion functions in tandem should not create any interworking issues.\nAnnex A (informative):GTT-Voice specific information for CTM support in, or associated with, all transcoders\nA.1\tGTT-Voice specific information for CTM support in, or associated with, all transcoders in the access network for GSM networks with A-interface\nThe CTM detection/conversion function may be incorporated in all transcoders where CTM activity can realistically be expected.

It is an option to create circuit pools on the A-interface, which support the CTM detection/conversion. The circuit pools are defined in TS 48.008 [15]. These pools may be incorporated in the transcoder, in a separate entity associated with a transcoder or in a separate entity located in particular A-interface circuits but remote from the transcoder.\nThe main steps of the process for a mobile originated call are:\n-\tSetup from terminal, including CTM indication.\nMSC detects CTM indication and allocates a circuit with CTM capabilities.\nThe main steps of the process for a mobile terminated call are:\n-\tSetup from MSC.\n-\tCall Confirm from terminal including CTM indication.\nMSC detects CTM indication and allocates a circuit with CTM capabilities.\nFigure B.1: CTM adaptor contained within a transcoder pool\nFigure B.2: CTM adapter present on specific A-interface circuits\nB.2\tGTT-Voice specific information for CTM support via core network termination selection for networks using Iu interface\nFor networks with GERAN and UTRAN radio access using the Iu interface, a method to allocate the calls to terminations capable of handling CTM on audio channels can be provided in the core network. It can be based on the mechanisms for controlling Media Gateway functions through the control language specified on the Mc interface. The MSC Server has information on CTM indication issued by the mobile station and allocates terminations with proper CTM capabilities for the detection/conversion during the call.\nThe main steps of the process for a mobile originated call are:\n-\tSetup from terminal, including CTM indication\nMSC server detects CTM indication and allocates a termination with CTM capabilities in the Media Gateway.\nThe main steps of the process for a mobile terminated call are:\n-\tSetup from the MSC Server.\n-\tCall Confirm from the terminal including CTM indication.\n-\tThe MSC server detects CTM indication and allocates a termination with CTM capabilities in the Media Gateway.\nFigure B.3: Association of a CTM capable termination within the Media Gateway\nAnnex C (Informative):GTT-Voice specific information for the CTM-SRF core network node solution\nThis clause describes a method how to route possible text calls via a core network node called the CTM-SRF. It should be taken as an informative example. It is based on CAMEL Phase 1 and call signalling with ISUP. Other call control environments and other IN service platforms can accomplish the same result.\nThis clause shows how emergency calls, terminating calls and originating calls can be routed through the CTM-SRF node without any modification to existing core network nodes. This covers also mobile-to-mobile calls.\nFor cases where emergency call support for text calls is wanted, all emergency calls are routed to the CTM-SRF server. The CTM-SRF server routes the call to the emergency centre. This can be done, as the CTM/textphone conversion channel itself is transparent to speech.\nOriginating and terminating calls, from and to possible text telephone users, are handled as CAMEL calls. A CAMEL service assures that the calls are routed through the CTM-SRF node by actions of a CAMEL application.\nC.1\tEmergency calls\nThe network has no means to distinguish text emergency calls from voice emergency calls in areas where the same number is used for both types. It may also be desired that even a phone borrowed for the purpose of making a text emergency call shall get the text service without any specific text subscription. Therefore, in order to meet these requirements, it shall be possible to configure the network to route all emergency calls through CTM-SRF server nodes.\nFigure C.1: Emergency call routing\nIf the emergency service use the same number for emergency text calls as for emergency voice calls, routing of all calls, regardless of text or speech, to a CTM-SRF server can be accomplished by configuration in the MSC/VLRs. The MSC/VLR can be configured in a way that, depending on the Emergency Centre addresses, emergency calls are always routed via a CTM-SRF server.\nThe CTM-SRF links in the CTM/textphone conversion function and routes the call further according to the received IAM.\nThe CTM-SRF node could recognise emergency calls by knowing all numbers of the emergency centres in question.\nFor US E-911-calls an additional method is given by looking at the CPC field. A special value is given.\n-\tCPC \"H'E0\" represents \"emergency service call\".\nIn general, the CTM-SRF server handles emergency calls in the same way as normal Mobile originated calls.\nC.2\tRouting of regular user calls\nRegular user calls that may contain text are routed to the CTM-SRF by a CAMEL service.\nText users are identified by a Text Telephony CAMEL Service Key (SK) and other CAMEL information stored in the HLR. The CTM part of this service modifies the Called Party Address (see following clauses). The call is routed through the CTM-SRF server and is then routed to the original destination.\nC.2.1\tMobile Terminating calls\nFigure C.2: Paths for routing of mobile terminating text calls with call path shown in thick arrows\nThe GMSC discovers that the user is a subscriber of the text telephony service, by the Camel Subscription Information information received from the HLR. The text Service Key is present and the Detection Point = Terminating_Attempt_Authorized.\nThe SCP with the text telephony service application is connected and the routing of the call through the CTM-SRF node is performed.\nTo control the activation of CAMEL service invocations an indication is sent from the CAMEL service via the CTM-SRF server back to the CAMEL service. This information is used by the CAMEL CTM-SCP service (2nd invocation) to do nothing but just to continue the call.\nThe indication is carried in the Calling Party Category parameter of ISUP.\nThis ISUP parameter is supported in CAP V1. InitalDP, and Connect. The CTM-SRF node and the CAMEL CTM-SCP service form an integrated application, and this ISUP parameter handling is regarded internal application signalling.\nFigure C.3: Mobile Terminating Text Call\nFor the support of text users, the CAMEL CTM-SCP service will return the textphone-number with a CTM-SRF server prefix in CAP_CONNECT. The GMSC creates a new O-BCSM for this CAMEL based forwarding leg. It uses the Destination Routing Address in CAP_CONNECT to do the routing and to send the ISUP_IAM. The routing is based on the CTM-SRF server prefix part.\nThe CTM-SRF server links in the CTM/textphone conversion function and extracts Text subscriber address, Nature of Address, and the Numbering Plan Indicator from the Destination Routing Address parameter. It stores the original CPC value in Additional Calling Party Number parameter. If Called Party's Category is not received, then this information as such is encoded. It writes this information to the appropriate IAM parameters and routes the call to a GMSC. It could be the same GMSC as before or a different one.\nThe GMSC regards this incoming IAM as a new terminating call to a text subscriber. A second time a dialogue for the \"same text call\" to a CAMEL service is invoked. The service realises this fact and does nothing but connecting the call to the Text subscriber (Called Party Number, respectively Destination Routing Address has not been changed by the CTM-SRF server).\nC.2.2\tMobile originating calls\nFigure C.4: Mobile originating call routing overview\nThe following sequence chart shows the mobile originating traffic case.\nFigure C.6: Mobile Originating Text Call\nFor normal originating calls the MSC finds the CAMEL text telephony Service Key in the VLR, together with information on the Detection Point = Collection of dialled digits. All non-emergency calls for the user will cause a connection to the text telephone service application in the CTM-SCP. The A-category value from the subscriber data in the VLR is used as CPC value.\nThe CAMEL service knows that it is an originating call. In this case it just forwards the Calling Party's Category parameter untouched.\nThe CTM-SRF removes its own address digits from the Called Party Address. The CTM/Text telephone conversion function is inserted before the call is routed towards the B-subscriber.\nC.2.3\tMobile to Mobile Calls\nTwo CTM-SRF servers are linked in, one on the originating leg and one on the terminating leg. The originating ISUP_IAM sent from the CTM-SRF server on the outgoing side is received by the GMSC as normal ISUP_IAM.\nC.3\tRouting actions of the CTM-SCP\nFrom the clauses above, it can be derived that the following actions are performed in the CAMEL server CTM-SCP acting on the CAP Interface.\nFigure C.7: CTM-SCP Logic for Mobile Terminated case. Detection point =Terminating Attempt Authorized\nFigure C.8: CTM_SCP logic for Mobile Originated case at detection point=Collection of dialled digits\nC.4\tRouting actions of the CTM-SRF\nFigure C.9: Routing logic in CTM-SRF for Mobile terminated calls\nFigure C.10: Routing logic in CTM-SRF, for Mobile Originated calls\nC.5\tService interactions\nC.5.1\tInteraction with other CAMEL services\nThe text users can use other CAMEL services. However, with other CAMEL services using the same Detection Point as the Text Telephone service, the other CAMEL services are impacted when using CAMEL Phase 1 as presented in this document.\nAs for the impact on existing CAMEL services, some of the services may be impacted anyway to support text users, for example Prepaid for playing announcement in text telephone signals.\nEvery CAMEL service, which is expected to be used by both voice and text users, and use the same CAMEL detection point as the GTT service, is assigned two SKs, one for non-text users and another for text users. For text users the other service logic has to integrate CTM-SCP routing logic.\nC.5.2\tInteractions with Supplementary Services\nIn general, no other interactions are expected than described in the CAMEL standard.\nCall Forwarding in GMSC is invoked after terminating CAMEL service invocation. This means the CTM-SRF service node is already linked in the call path. A further invocation of a mobile originated CAMEL based service will cause an additional routing to a CTM-SRF service node. This is needed to convert the text back to text telephone coding, e.g. Baudot, which is required for the following routing towards the forwarded-to-party (C-party).\nC.5.3\tEmergency Call interaction\nNew emergency call categories introduced in 3GPP Release 4 (introduced as emergency-call enhancement) have no impact on routing of emergency calls via CTM-SRF server.\nNew categories may be specified in order to detect text emergency calls.\nC.5.4\tUsage of Destination Routing Address\nThe Destination Routing Address CAMEL parameter is used by the service logic for two purposes.\n-\tIt contains the CTM-SRF server address to let the MSC to route the call to the CTM-SRF server.\n-\tIt contains the original B-subscriber address, to let the CTM-SRF server to use it as Called Party Number on the outgoing side.\nWhen the service logic reconnects the CTM-SRF server, the service has to save the Nature of Address and the Numbering Plan Indicator of the original Called Party Number in the Destination Routing Address parameter.\nCAMEL Phase 1 Destination Routing Address has up to 12 octets. Two octets are needed to encode Nature of Address and the Numbering Plan Indicator. This means that 10 octets are left for CTM-SRF server address digits plus Called Party Address digits. All together 20 digits are given.\nAn international one up to 15 digits according E.164. This results in having 5 digits left for CTM-SRF server addressing.\nC.5.5\tInserting CTM/Text telephone conversion function\nThe CTM/Text telephone conversion function is direction oriented. A CTM modem should be connected towards the radio side and a modem for ITU‑T Recommendation V.18 [4] or any of its text telephone submodes towards the other direction. Therefore the CTM-SRF server has to distinguish between mobile terminating and mobile originating calls.\nThis can be achieved by either allocating different channels for the directions or make decision based on the Called number to the CTM-SRF.\nC.5.6\tLawful interception\nDepending on where on the route the intercept is made, and also depending on the support for CTM in the terminal, the coding in the intercept point will be transmitted in CTM modulation and coding, or native PSTN text telephone coding and modulation. Both are possible to decode, and a combined decoder can be designed.\nNOTE:\tIn some countries it is required that all PLMN specific codings are decoded before the lawful interception. In this case operators must upgrade their lawful interception equipment.\nAnnex D (informative):Change history\nChange history\nDate\nTSG #\nTSG Doc.\nCR\nRev\nCat\nSubject/Comment\nOld\nNew\n2004-12\nSP-29\n-\nUpgraded to Release 6\n5.2.0\n6.0.0\n2006-03\nSP-31\nSP-060139\n0003\n-\n-\nUpdate of three references on real time text\n6.0.0\n7.0.0\n2008-12\nSP-42\n-\n-\n-\nUpdated to Rel-8 version (MCC)\n7.0.0\n8.0.0\n2009-12\nSP-46\nSP-090795\n0005\n2\nF\nCorrection to introduce interworking and emergency aspects of GTT-IP\n8.0.0\n9.0.0\n2011-03\nSP-51\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-10 version (MCC)\n9.0.0\n10.0.0\n2012-09\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-11 version (MCC)\n10.0.0\n11.0.0\n2014-09\nSP-65\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-12 version (MCC)\n11.0.0\n12.0.0\n2015-12\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-13 version (MCC)\n12.0.0\n13.0.0\n2017-03\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-14 version (MCC)\n13.0.0\n14.0.0\n2018-06\nSP-80\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-15 version (MCC)\n14.0.0\n15.0.0\n2020-07\nSP-88E\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-16 version (MCC)\n15.0.0\n16.0.0\n2022-03\nSP-95E\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-17 version (MCC)\n16.0.0\n17.0.0\n2024-03\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-18 version (MCC)\n17.0.0\n18.0.0",
