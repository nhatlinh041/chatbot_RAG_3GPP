      "content": "For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in TR 21.905 [8] and the following apply. A term defined in the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905 [8].\napplication detection filter: A logic used to detect packets generated by an application based on extended inspection of these packets, e.g. header and/or payload information, as well as dynamics of packet flows. The logic is entirely internal to a TDF or a PCEF enhanced with ADC, and is out of scope of this specification.\napplication identifier: An identifier referring to a specific application detection filter.\napplication service provider: A business entity responsible for the application that is being / will be used by a UE, which may be either an AF operator or has an association with the AF operator.\nADC decision: A decision consists of references to ADC rules, associated enforcement actions (for dynamic ADC rules) and TDF session attributes and is provided by the PCRF to the TDF for application detection and control.\nADC rule: A set of information enabling the detection of application traffic and associated enforcement actions. ADC rules are directly provisioned into the TDF and referenced by the PCRF.\nauthorised QoS: The maximum QoS that is authorised for a service data flow. In case of an aggregation of multiple service data flows within one IP‑CAN bearer (e.g. for GPRS a PDP context), the combination of the \"Authorised QoS\" information of the individual service data flows is the \"Authorised QoS\" for the IP‑CAN bearer. It contains the QoS class identifier and the data rate.\nbinding: The association between a service data flow and the IP‑CAN bearer (for GPRS the PDP context) transporting that service data flow.\nbinding mechanism: The method for creating, modifying and deleting bindings.\ncharging control: The process of associating packets, belonging to a service data flow, to a charging key and applying online charging and/or offline charging, as appropriate.\ncharging key: information used by the online and offline charging system for rating purposes.\ndetected application traffic: An aggregate set of packet flows that are generated by a given application and detected by an application detection filter.\ndynamic ADC Rule: an ADC rule, for which the PCRF can provide and modify some parameters via the Sd reference point.\ndynamic PCC Rule: a PCC rule, for which the definition is provided to the PCEF via the Gx reference point.\nevent report: a notification, possibly containing additional information, of an event which occurs that corresponds with an event trigger. Also, an event report is a report from the PCRF to the AF concerning transmission resources or requesting additional information.\nevent trigger: a rule specifying the event reporting behaviour of a PCEF or BBERF or TDF. Also, it is a trigger for credit management events.\ngating control: The process of blocking or allowing packets, belonging to a service data flow / detected application's traffic, to pass through to the desired endpoint.\nGateway Control Session: An association between a BBERF and a PCRF (when GTP is not used in the EPC), used for transferring access specific parameters, BBERF events and QoS rules between PCRF and BBERF.\nGBR bearer: An IP‑CAN bearer with reserved (guaranteed) bitrate resources.\nGPRS IP‑CAN: This IP‑CAN incorporates GPRS over GERAN and UTRAN, see TS 23.060 [12].\nIP‑CAN bearer: An IP transmission path of defined capacity, delay and bit error rate, etc. See TR 21.905 [8] for the definition of bearer.\nIP‑CAN session: The association between a UE and an IP network. The association is identified by one IPv4 and/or an IPv6 prefix together with UE identity information, if available, and a PDN represented by a PDN ID (e.g. an APN). An IP‑CAN session incorporates one or more IP‑CAN bearers. Support for multiple IP‑CAN bearers per IP‑CAN session is IP‑CAN specific. An IP‑CAN session exists as long as UE IP addresses/prefix are established and announced to the IP network.\nnon-GBR bearer: An IP‑CAN bearer with no reserved (guaranteed) bitrate resources.\noperator-controlled service: A service for which complete PCC rule information, including service data flow filter information, is available in the PCRF through configuration and/or dynamic interaction with an AF.\npacket flow: A specific user data flow from and/or to the UE.\nPresence Reporting Area: An area defined within 3GPP Packet Domain for the purposes of reporting of UE presence within that area due to policy control and/or charging reasons. There are two types of Presence Reporting Areas: \"UE-dedicated Presence Reporting Areas\", and \"Core Network pre-configured Presence Reporting Areas\". They are further defined in TS 23.401 [17].\nPCC decision: A decision consists of PCC rules and IP‑CAN bearer attributes and is provided by the PCRF to the PCEF for policy and charging control and, for PCEF enhanced with ADC, application detection and control.\nPCC rule: A set of information enabling the detection of a service data flow and providing parameters for policy control and/or charging control and, for PCEF enhanced with ADC, for application detection and control.\nPCEF enhanced with ADC: PCEF, enhanced with application detection and control feature.\npolicy control: The process whereby the PCRF indicates to the PCEF how to control the IP‑CAN bearer. Policy control includes QoS control and/or gating control.\npredefined PCC Rule: a PCC rule that has been provisioned directly into the PCEF by the operator.\npolicy counter: A mechanism within the OCS to track spending applicable to a subscriber.\npolicy counter identifier: A reference to a policy counter in the OCS for a subscriber.\npolicy counter status: A label whose values are not standardized and that is associated with a policy counter's value relative to the spending limit(s) (the number of possible policy counter status values for a policy counter is one greater than the number of thresholds associated with that policy counter, i.e policy counter status values describe the status around the thresholds). This is used to convey information relating to subscriber spending from OCS to PCRF. Specific labels are configured jointly in OCS and PCRF.\nPacket Flow Description (PFD): A set of information enabling the detection of application traffic provided by a 3rd party service provider. A PFD is further defined in TS 23.682 [42].\nQoS class identifier (QCI): A scalar that is used as a reference to a specific packet forwarding behaviour (e.g. packet loss rate, packet delay budget) to be provided to a SDF. This may be implemented in the access network by the QCI referencing node specific parameters that control packet forwarding treatment (e.g. scheduling weights, admission thresholds, queue management thresholds, link layer protocol configuration, etc.), that have been pre-configured by the operator at a specific node(s) (e.g. eNodeB).\nQoS rule: A set of information enabling the detection of a service data flow and defining its associated QoS parameters.\nMonitoring key: information used by the PCEF, TDF and PCRF for usage monitoring control purposes as a reference to a given set of service data flows or application (s), that all share a common allowed usage on a per UE and APN basis.\nRAN user plane congestion: RAN user plane congestion occurs when the demand for RAN resources exceeds the available RAN capacity to deliver the user data for a prolonged period of time.\nNOTE 1:\tShort-duration traffic bursts is a normal condition at any traffic load level, and is not considered to be RAN user plane congestion. Likewise, a high-level of utilization of RAN resources (based on operator configuration) is considered a normal mode of operation and might not be RAN user plane congestion.\nRedirection: Redirect the detected service traffic to an application server (e.g. redirect to a top-up / service provisioning page).\nservice data flow: An aggregate set of packet flows carried through the PCEF that matches a service data flow template.\nservice data flow filter: A set of packet flow header parameter values/ranges used to identify one or more of the packet flows. The possible service data flow filters are defined in clause 6.2.2.2.\nservice data flow filter identifier: A scalar that is unique for a specific service data flow (SDF) filter (used on Gx and Gxx) within an IP‑CAN session.\nservice data flow template: The set of service data flow filters in a PCC Rule or an application identifier in a PCC rule referring to an application detection filter, required for defining a service data flow.\nservice identifier: An identifier for a service. The service identifier provides the most detailed identification, specified for flow based charging, of a service data flow. A concrete instance of a service may be identified if additional AF information is available (further details to be found in clause 6.3.1).\nsession based service: An end user service requiring application level signalling, which is separated from service rendering.\nspending limit: A spending limit is the usage limit of a policy counter (e.g. monetary, volume, duration) that a subscriber is allowed to consume.\nspending limit report: a notification, containing the current policy counter status generated from the OCS to the PCRF via the Sy reference point.\nsubscribed guaranteed bandwidth QoS: The per subscriber, authorized cumulative guaranteed bandwidth QoS which is provided by the SPR/UDR to the PCRF.\nsubscriber category: is a means to group the subscribers into different classes, e.g. gold user, the silver user and the bronze user.\n(S)Gi-LAN: The network infrastructure connected to the 3GPP network over the SGi or Gi reference point that provides various IP-based services.\n(S)Gi-LAN service function: A function located in the (S)Gi-LAN that provides value-added IP-based services e.g. NAT, anti-malware, parental control, DDoS protection.\nTDF session: An association between an IP-CAN session and the assigned TDF for the purpose of application detection and control.\nuplink bearer binding verification: The network enforcement of terminal compliance with the negotiated uplink traffic mapping to bearers.\nFor the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions given in TS 23.401 [17] apply:\nNarrowband-IoT: See TS 23.401 [17].\nWB-E-UTRAN: See TS 23.401 [17].",

The latter is referred to as a dynamic PCC rule.\nThe number of real-time PCC interactions shall be minimized although not significantly increasing the overall system reaction time. This requires optimized interfaces between the PCC nodes.\nIt shall be possible to take a PCC rule into service, and out of service, at a specific time of day, without any PCC interaction at that point in time.\nIt shall be possible to take APN-related policy information into service, and out of service, once validity conditions specified as part of the APN-related policy information are fulfilled or not fulfilled anymore, respectively, without any PCC interaction at that point in time.\nPCC shall be enabled on a per PDN basis (represented by an access point and the configured range of IP addresses) at the PCEF. It shall be possible for the operator to configure the PCC architecture to perform charging control, policy control or both for a PDN access.\nPCC shall support roaming users.\nThe PCC architecture shall allow the resolution of conflicts which would otherwise cause a subscriber's Subscribed Guaranteed Bandwidth QoS to be exceeded.\nThe PCC architecture shall support topology hiding.\nIt should be possible to use PCC architecture for handling IMS-based emergency service and Restricted Local Operator Services.\nIt shall be possible with the PCC architecture, in real-time, to monitor the overall amount of resources that are consumed by a user and to control usage independently from charging mechanisms, the so-called usage monitoring control.\nIt shall be possible for the PCC architecture to provide application awareness even when there is no explicit service level signalling.\nThe PCC architecture shall support making policy decisions based on subscriber spending limits.\nThe PCC architecture shall support making policy decisions based on RAN user plane congestion status.\nThe PCC architecture shall support making policy decisions for multi-access IP flow mobility solution described in TS 23.161 [43].\nThe PCC architecture shall support making policy decisions for (S)Gi-LAN traffic steering.",

In this case settlement for all parties shall be supported, including the third parties that may have been involved providing the services.\nNOTE 2:\tWhen developing a charging solution, the PCC charging models may be combined to form the solution. How to achieve a specific solution is however not within the scope of this TS.\nNOTE 3:\tThe Event based charging defined in this specification applies only to session based charging as defined by the charging specifications.\n4.2.2a\tCharging requirements\nThe requirements in this clause apply to both PCC rules based charging and ADC rules based charging unless exceptions are explicitly mentioned.\nIt shall be possible to apply different rates and charging models when a user is identified to be roaming from when the user is in the home network. Furthermore, it shall be possible to apply different rates and charging models based on the location of a user, beyond the granularity of roaming.\nIt shall be possible to apply different rates and charging models when a user consuming network services via a CSG cell or a hybrid cell according to the user CSG information. User CSG information includes CSG ID, access mode and CSG membership indication.\nIt shall be possible to apply a separate rate to a specific service, e.g. allow the user to download a certain volume of data, reserved for the purpose of one service for free, and then continue with a rate causing a charge.\nIt shall be possible to change the rate based on the time of day.\nIt shall be possible to enforce per-service identified by PCC Rule/per-application identified by ADC Rule usage limits for a service data flow using online charging on a per user basis (may apply to prepaid and post-paid users).\nIt shall be possible to apply different rates depending on the access used to carry a Service Data Flow. This applies also to a PDN connection supporting NBIFOM.\nIt shall be possible for the online charging system to set and send the thresholds (time and/or volume based) for the amount of remaining credit to the PCEF or TDF for monitoring. In case the PCEF or TDF detects that any of the time based or volume based credit falls below the threshold, the PCEF or TDF shall send a request for credit re-authorization to the OCS with the remaining credit (time and/or volume based).\nIt shall be possible for the charging system to select the applicable rate based on:\n-\thome/visited IP‑CAN;\n-\tUser CSG information;\n-\tIP‑CAN bearer characteristics (e.g. QoS);\n-\tQoS provided for the service;\n-\ttime of day;\n-\tIP‑CAN specific parameters according to Annex A.\nIP-CAN bearer characteristics are not applicable to charging performed in TDF.\nNOTE 1:\tThe same IP-CAN parameters related to access network/subscription/location information as reported for service data flow based charging may need to be reported for the application based charging at the beginning of the session and following any of the relevant re-authorization triggers.\nThe charging system maintains the tariff information, determining the rate based on the above input. Thus the rate may change e.g. as a result of IP‑CAN session modification to change the bearer characteristics provided for a service data flow.\nThe charging rate or charging model applicable to a service data flow/detected application traffic may change as a result of events in the service (e.g. insertion of a paid advertisement within a user requested media stream).\nThe charging model applicable to a service data flow/detected application traffic may change as a result of events identified by the OCS (e.g. after having spent a certain amount of time and/or volume, the user gets to use some services for free).\nThe charging rate or charging model applicable to a service data flow/detected application traffic may change as a result of having used the service data flow/detected application traffic for a certain amount of time and/or volume.\nFor online charging, it shall be possible to apply an online charging action upon PCEF or TDF events (e.g. re-authorization upon QoS change).\nIt shall be possible to apply an online charging action for detected application upon Application Start/Stop events.\nIt shall be possible to indicate to the PCEF or TDF that interactions with the charging systems are not required for a PCC or ADC rule, i.e. to perform neither accounting nor credit control for the service data flow/detected application traffic, and then no offline charging information is generated.\nThis specification supports charging and enforcement being done in either the PCEF or the TDF for a certain IP-CAN session, but not both for the same IP-CAN session (applies to all IP-CAN sessions belonging to the same APN).\nNOTE 2:\tThe above requirement is to ensure that there is no double charging in both TDF and PCEF or over charging in case of packet discarded at PCEF or TDF.",

      "content": "There are many different services that may be used within a network, including both user-user and user-network services. Service data flows from these services may be identified and charged in many different ways. A number of examples of configuring PCC rules for different service data flows are described below.\nEXAMPLE 1:\tA network server provides an FTP service. The FTP server supports both the active (separate ports for control and data) and passive modes of operation. A PCC rule is configured for the service data flows associated with the FTP server for the user. The PCC rule uses a filter specification for the uplink that identifies packets sent to port 20 or 21 of the IP address of the server, and the origination information is wildcarded. In the downlink direction, the filter specification identifies packets sent from port 20 or 21 of the IP address of the server.\nEXAMPLE 2:\tA network server provides a \"web\" service. A PCC rule is configured for the service data flows associated with the HTTP server for the user. The PCC rule uses a filter specification for the uplink that identifies packets sent to port 80 of the IP address of the server, and the origination information is wildcarded. In the downlink direction, the filter specification identifies packets sent from port 80 of the IP address of the server.\nEXAMPLE 3:\tThe same server provides a WAP service. The server has multiple IP addresses, and the IP address of the WAP server is different from the IP address of the web server. The PCC rule uses the same filter specification as for the web server, but with the IP addresses for the WAP server only.\nEXAMPLE 4:\tAn operator offers a zero rating for network provided DNS service. A PCC rule is established setting all DNS traffic to/from the operators DNS servers as offline charged. The data flow filter identifies the DNS port number, and the source/destination address within the subnet range allocated to the operators network nodes.\nEXAMPLE 5:\tAn operator has a specific charging rate for user-user VoIP traffic over the IMS. A PCC rule is established for this service data flow. The filter information to identify the specific service data flow for the user-user traffic is provided by the P‑CSCF (AF).\nEXAMPLE 6:\tAn operator is implementing UICC based authentication mechanisms for HTTP based services utilizing the GAA Framework as defined in TR 33.919 [11] by e.g. using the Authentication Proxy. The Authentication Proxy may appear as an AF and provide information to the PCRF for the purpose of selecting an appropriate PCC Rule.",

      "content": "The application detection and control feature comprise the request to detect the specified application traffic, report to the PCRF on the start or stop of application traffic and to apply the specified enforcement and charging actions.\nThe application detection and control shall be implemented either by the TDF or by the PCEF enhanced with ADC.\nTwo models may be applied, depending on operator requirements: solicited and unsolicited application reporting. The unsolicited application reporting is only supported by the TDF.\nSolicited application reporting: The PCRF shall instruct the TDF, or the PCEF enhanced with ADC, on which applications to detect and whether to report start or stop event to the PCRF by activating the appropriate ADC/PCC rules in the TDF/PCEF enhanced with ADC. Reporting notifications of start and stop of application detection to the PCRF may be muted, in addition, per specific ADC/PCC rule. The PCRF may, in a dynamic ADC/PCC rule, instruct the TDF or PCEF enhanced with ADC, what enforcement actions to apply to the detected application traffic. The PCRF may activate application detection only if user profile configuration allows this.\nUnsolicited application reporting: The TDF is pre-configured on which applications to detect and report. The PCRF may enable enforcement in the PCEF based on the service data flow description provided to PCRF by the TDF. It is assumed that user profile configuration indicating whether application detection and control can be enabled is not required.\nThe report to the PCRF shall include the same information for solicited and unsolicited application reporting that is whether the report is for start or stop, the detected application identifier and, if deducible, the service data flow descriptions for the detected application traffic.\nFor the application types, where service data flow descriptions are deducible, the Start and Stop of the application may be indicated multiple times, including the application instance identifier to inform the PCRF about the service data flow descriptions belonging to that application instance. The application instance identifier is dynamically assigned by the TDF or by the PCEF enhanced with ADC in order to allow correlation of application Start and Stop events to the specific service data flow description.\nNOTE 1:\tThe reporting to the PCRF on the start or stop of application traffic is not depending on any enforcement action of the ADC/PCC rule. Unless the PCRF muted the reporting for the ADC/PCC rule, every detected start or stop event is reported even if the application traffic is discarded due to enforcement actions of the ADC/PCC rule.\nFor the TDF operating in the solicited application reporting model:\n-\tWhen the TDF cannot provide to the PCRF the service data flow description for the detected applications, the TDF shall perform charging, gating, redirection and bandwidth limitation for the detected applications, as defined in the ADC rule. The existing PCEF functionality remains unchanged.\nNOTE 2:\tRedirection may not be possible for all types of detected application traffic (e.g. this may only be performed on specific HTTP based flows).\n-\tWhen the TDF provides to the PCRF the service data flow description, the PCRF may take control over the actions resulting of application detection, by applying the charging and policy enforcement per service data flow as defined in this document, or the TDF may perform charging, gating, redirection and bandwidth limitation as described above. It is the PCRF's responsibility to coordinate the PCC rules with ADC rules in order to ensure consistent service delivery.\nUsage monitoring as described in clause 4.4 may be activated in conjunction with application detection and control. The usage monitoring functionality is only applicable to the solicited application reporting model.\nFor TDF, ADC rule based charging is applicable. ADC rule based charging, as described in clause 4.2.2a, may be activated in conjunction with application detection and control. The charging functionality is only applicable to the solicited application reporting model.\nIn order to avoid charging for the same traffic in both the TDF and the PCEF, this specification supports charging and enforcement implemented in either the PCEF or the TDF for a certain IP-CAN session, but not both for the same IP-CAN session.\nThe ADC rules are used to determine the online and offline characteristics for charging. For offline charging, usage reporting over the Gzn interface shall be used. For online charging, credit management and reporting over the Gyn interface shall be used. The PCEF is in this case not used for charging and enforcement (based on active PCC rules and APN-AMBR configuration), but shall still be performing bearer binding based on the active PCC rules. In order to avoid having traffic that is charged in the TDF later discarded by the policing function in the PCEF, the assumption is that no GBR bearers are required when TDF is the charging and policy enforcement point. In addition, the DL APN-AMBR in PCEF shall be configured with such high values that it does not result in discarded packets.\nNOTE 3:\tAn example of applicability is IMS APN, which would require dynamic PCC rules, would be configured such that PCEF based charging and enforcement is employed, but for regular internet access APN, the network would be configured such that the TDF performs both charging and enforcement.\nNOTE 4:\tAn operator may also apply this solution with both PCEF and TDF performing enforcement and charging for a single IP-CAN session as long as the network is configured in such a way that the traffic charged and enforced in the PCEF does not overlap with the traffic charged and enforced by the TDF.\nNOTE 5:\tThe PCEF may still do enforcement actions on uplink traffic without impacting the accuracy of the charging information produced by the TDF.\nIf only charging for a service data flow identified by a PCC Rule is required for the corresponding IP-CAN session, the PCEF performs charging and policy enforcement for the IP-CAN session. The TDF may be used for application detection and reporting of application start/stop and for enforcement actions on downlink traffic.",

Based on AF instructions (as described in clause 6.1.5) dynamic PCC rules can be authorized even if they are not complete (e.g. due to missing service information regarding QoS or traffic filter parameters).\nThe PCC rule authorization depends on the IP‑CAN bearer establishment mode of the IP‑CAN session and the mode (UE or NW) of the PCC rule:\n-\tIn UE/NW bearer establishment mode, the PCRF shall perform the authorization for all PCC rules that are to be handled in NW mode.\n-\tIn UE/NW bearer establishment mode, for PCC rules that are to be handled in UE mode or when in UE-only bearer establishment mode, the PCRF shall first identify the PCC rules that correspond to a UE resource request and authorize only these.\nThe PCRF shall compare the traffic mapping information of the UE resource request with the service data flow filter information of the services that are allowed for the user. Each part of the traffic mapping information shall be evaluated separately in the order of their related precedence. Any matching service data flow filter leads to an authorization of the corresponding PCC rule for the UE resource request unless the PCC rule is already authorized for a more specific traffic mapping information or the PCC rule cannot be authorized for the QCI that is related to the UE resource request (the details are described in the next paragraph). Since a PCC rule can contain multiple service data flow filters it shall be ensured by the PCRF that a service data flow is only authorized for a single UE resource request.\nNOTE 1:\tFor example, a PCC rule containing multiple service data flow filters that match traffic mapping information of different UE resource requests could be segmented by the PCRF according to the different matching traffic mapping information. Afterwards, the PCRF can authorize the different PCC rules individually.\nThe PCRF knows whether a PCC rule can be authorized for a single QCI only or a set of QCIs (based on SPR information or local configuration). If the processing of the traffic mapping information would lead to an authorization of a PCC rule, the PCRF shall also check whether the PCC rule can be authorized for the QCI that is related to the UE resource request containing the traffic mapping information. If the PCC rule cannot be authorized for this QCI, the PCRF shall reject the traffic mapping information unless otherwise stated in an access-specific Annex.\nIf there is any traffic mapping information not matching to any service data flow filter known to the PCRF and the UE is allowed to request for enhanced QoS for traffic not belonging to operator-controlled services, the PCRF shall authorize this traffic mapping information by adding the respective service data flow filter to a new or existing PCC. If the PCRF received an SDF filter identifier together with this traffic mapping information, the PCRF shall modify the existing PCC rule if the PCC rule is authorized for a GBR QCI.\nNOTE 2:\tIf the PCC rule is authorized for a non-GBR QCI, the PCRF may either create a new PCC rule or modify the existing PCC rule.\nThe PCC rule that needs to be modified can be identified by the service data flow filter the SDF filter identifier refers to. The requested QoS shall be checked against the subscription limitations for traffic not belonging to operator-controlled services.\nIf the PCRF needs to perform the authorization based on incomplete service information and thus cannot associate a PCC rule with a single IP‑CAN bearer, then the PCRF shall generate for the affected service data flow an individual PCC rule per IP‑CAN bearer that could carry that service data flow. Once the PCRF receives the complete service information, the PCC rule on the IP‑CAN bearer with the matching traffic mapping information shall be updated according to the service information. Any other PCC rule(s) previously generated for the same service data flow shall be removed by the PCRF.\nNOTE 3:\tThis is required to enable the successful activation or modification of IP‑CAN bearers before knowing the intended use of the IP‑CAN bearers to carry the service data flow(s).\nFor an IP‑CAN, where the PCRF gains no information about the uplink IP flows (i.e. the UE provided traffic mapping information contains no information about the uplink IP flows), the binding mechanism shall assume that, for bi-directional service data flows, both downlink and uplink packets travel on the same IP‑CAN bearer.\nWhenever the service data flow template or the UE provided traffic mapping information change, the existing authorizations shall be re-evaluated, i.e. the authorization procedure specified in this clause, is performed. The re-evaluation may, for a service data flow, require a new authorization for a different UE provided mapping information.\nBased on PCRF configuration or AF instructions (as described in clause 6.1.5) dynamic PCC rules may have to be first authorized for the default QCI/default bearer (i.e. bearer without UE provided traffic mapping information) until a corresponding UE resource request occurs.\nNOTE 4:\tThis is required to enable services that start before dedicated resources are allocated.\nA PCC rule for a service data flow that is a candidate for vSRVCC according to TS 23.216 [28] shall have the PS to CS session continuity indicator set.\nFor the authorization of a PCC rule the PCRF shall take into account the IP‑CAN specific restrictions and other information available to the PCRF. Each PCC rule receives a set of QoS parameters that can be supported by the IP‑CAN. The authorization of a PCC rule associated with an emergency service and Restricted Local Operator Services shall be supported without subscription information (e.g. information stored in the SPR). The PCRF shall apply policies configured for the emergency service and Restricted Local Operator Services.\nWhen both a Gx and associated Gxx interface(s) exist for an IP‑CAN session, the PCRF shall generate QoS rules for all the authorized PCC rules in this step. The PCRF shall ensure consistency between the QoS rules and PCC rules authorized for the same service data flow when QoS rules are derived from corresponding PCC rules.\nWhen flow mobility applies for the IP-CAN Session, one IP‑CAN session may be associated to multiple Gateway Control Sessions with separate BBRFs. In this case, the PCRF shall provision QoS rules only to the appropriate BBERF based on IP flow mobility routing rules received from the PCEF.",

      "content": "Bearer binding is the association of the PCC rule and the QoS rule (if applicable) to an IP‑CAN bearer within that IP‑CAN session. This function resides in the Bearer Binding Function (BBF).\nThe Bearer Binding Function is located either at the BBERF or at the PCEF, depending on the architecture (see clause 5.1). The BBF is located at the PCEF if GTP is used as the mobility protocol towards the PCEF; otherwise, the BBF is located at the BBERF.\nThe Bearer Binding Function may also be located in the PCRF as specified in Annex A and Annex D (e.g. for GPRS running UE only IP‑CAN bearer establishment mode).\nNOTE 1:\tFor an IP‑CAN, limited to a single IP‑CAN bearer per IP‑CAN session, the bearer is implicit, so finding the IP‑CAN session is sufficient for successful binding.\nFor an IP‑CAN which allows for multiple IP‑CAN bearers for each IP‑CAN session, the binding mechanism shall use the QoS parameters of the existing IP‑CAN bearers to create the bearer binding for a rule, in addition to the PCC rule and the QoS rule (if applicable) authorized in the previous step.\nThe set of QoS parameters assigned in step 2, as described in clause 6.1.1.3, to the service data flow is the main input for bearer binding. The BBF should not use the same bearer for rules with different settings for the PS to CS session continuity indicator.\nNOTE 2:\tWhen NBIFOM applies for the IP-CAN session, additional information has to be taken into account as described in clause 6.1.18.1.\nThe BBF shall evaluate whether it is possible to use one of the existing IP‑CAN bearers or not and whether initiate IP‑CAN bearer modification if applicable. If none of the existing bearers are possible to use, the BBF should initiate the establishment of a suitable IP‑CAN bearer. The binding is created between service data flow(s) and the IP‑CAN bearer which have the same QoS class identifier and ARP.\nNOTE 3:\tThe handling of a rule with MBR>GBR is up to operator policy (e.g. an independent IP‑CAN bearer may be maintained for that SDF to prevent unfairness between competing SDFs).\nRequirements, specific for each type of IP‑CAN, are defined in the IP‑CAN specific Annex.\nWhenever the QoS authorization of a PCC/QoS rule changes, the existing bindings shall be re-evaluated, i.e. the bearer binding procedures specified in this clause, is performed. The re-evaluation may, for a service data flow, require a new binding with another IP‑CAN bearer. The BBF should, if the PCRF requests the same change to the ARP/QCI value for all PCC/QoS Rules with the bearer binding to the same bearer, modify the bearer ARP/QCI value as requested.\nNOTE 4:\tA QoS change of the default EPS bearer causes the bearer binding for PCC/QoS rules previously bound to the default EPS bearer to be re-evaluated. At the end of the re-evaluation of the PCC/QoS rules of the IP-CAN session, there needs to be at least one PCC rule that successfully binds with the default bearer.",

      "section_title": "Credit management",
      "content": "The credit management applies for online charging only and shall operate on a per charging key basis. The PCEF should initiate one credit management session with the OCS for each IP‑CAN Session subject to online charging, unless specified otherwise in an IP‑CAN specific annex. Alternatively, the PCEF may initiate one credit management session for each IP‑CAN bearer as defined in the applicable annex. The TDF should initiate one credit management session with the OCS for each TDF Session subject to online charging.\nNOTE 1:\tIndependent credit control for an individual service/application may be achieved by assigning a unique charging key value in the corresponding PCC/ADC rule.\nThe PCEF/TDF shall request a credit for each charging key occurring in a PCC/ADC rule. It shall be up to operator configuration whether the PCEF/TDF shall request credit in conjunction with the PCC/ADC rule being activated or when the first packet corresponding to the service/the application is detected. The OCS may either grant or deny the request for credit. The OCS shall strictly control the rating decisions.\nNOTE 2:\tThe term 'credit' as used here does not imply actual monetary credit, but an abstract measure of resources available to the user. The relationship between this abstract measure, actual money, and actual network resources or data transfer, is controlled by the OCS.\nDuring IP‑CAN session establishment and modification, the PCEF shall request credit using the information after applying policy enforcement action (e.g. upgraded or downgraded QoS information), if applicable, even though the PCEF has not signalled it yet in the IP‑CAN.\nIt shall be possible for the OCS to form a credit pool for multiple (one or more) charging keys, applied at the PCEF/TDF, e.g. with the objective of avoiding credit fragmentation. Multiple pools of credit shall be allowed per IP‑CAN bearer/TDF session. The OCS shall control the credit pooling decisions. The OCS shall, when credit authorization is sought, either grant a new pool of credit, together with a new credit limit, or give a reference to a pool of credit that is already granted for that IP‑CAN bearer/TDF session. The grouping of charging keys into pools shall not restrict the ability of the OCS to do credit authorisation and provide termination action individually for each charging key of the pool. It shall be possible for the OCS to group service data flows/applications charged at different rates or in different units (e.g. time/volume/event) into the same pool.\nFor each charging key, the PCEF/TDF may receive credit re-authorisation trigger information from the OCS, which shall cause the PCEF/TDF to perform a credit re-authorisation when the event occurs. If there are events which can not be monitored in the PCEF/TDF, the PCEF/TDF shall provide the information about the required event triggers to the PCRF. If information about required event triggers is provided to the PCRF, it is an implementation option whether a successful confirmation is required from the PCRF in order for the PCEF/TDF to consider the credit (re-)authorization procedure to be successful. The credit re-authorisation trigger detection shall cause the PCEF/TDF to request re-authorisation of the credit in the OCS. It shall be possible for the OCS to instruct the PCEF/TDF to seek re-authorisation of credit in case of the events listed in table 6.1.\nTable 6.1: Credit re-authorization triggers\nCredit re-authorization trigger\nDescription\nApplicable for\nCredit authorisation lifetime expiry\nThe OCS has limited the validity of the credit to expire at a certain time.\nPCEF, TDF\nIdle timeout\nThe service data flow identified by a PCC Rules or the application identified by an ADC Rule has been empty for a certain time.\nPCEF, TDF\nPLMN change\nThe UE has moved to another operators' domain.\nPCEF, TDF\nQoS changes\nThe QoS of the IP‑CAN bearer has changed.\nPCEF\nChange in type of IP‑CAN\nThe type of the IP‑CAN has changed.\nPCEF, TDF\nLocation change (serving cell)\nThe serving cell of the UE has changed.\nPCEF, TDF\nLocation change (serving area) (see note 2)\nThe serving area of the UE has changed.\nPCEF, TDF\nLocation change (serving CN node) (see note 3)\nThe serving core network node of the UE has changed.\nPCEF, TDF\nChange of UE presence in Presence Reporting Area (see note 4)\nThe UE has entered or left a Presence Reporting Area\nPCEF, TDF\nNOTE 1:\tThis list is not exhaustive.

The maximum number of PRA(s) per UE per PDN connection is configured in the OCS. The OCS may have independent configuration of the maximum number for Core Network pre-configured PRAs and UE-dedicated PRAs. The exact number(s) should be determined by operator in deployment.\nIf the Location change trigger is armed, the PCEF shall activate the relevant IP‑CAN specific procedure which reports any changes in location to the level indicated by the trigger. If credit-authorization triggers and event triggers require different levels of reporting of location change for a single UE, the location to be reported should be changed to the highest level of detail required. However, there should be no request being triggered for credit re-authorization to the OCS if the report received is more detailed than requested by the OCS.\nNOTE 1:\tThe access network may be configured to report location changes only when transmission resources are established in the radio access network.\nThe OCS determines at credit management session establishment/modification, based on local configuration, if the UE is located in an access type that supports reporting changes of UE presence in Presence Reporting Area. If the access type supports it, the OCS may subscribe to Change of UE presence in Presence Reporting Area at any time during the life time of the credit management session.\nNOTE 2:\tIf Presence Reporting Area reporting is not supported, the OCS may instead activate Location change reporting at cell and/or serving area level but due to the potential increase in signalling load, it is recommended that such reporting is only applied for a limited number of subscribers.\nWhen activating reporting for change of UE presence in Presence Reporting Area, the OCS provides all of the PRA Identifier(s) to be activated for Core Network pre-configured Presence Reporting Area(s) and additionally all of PRA Identifier(s) and the list(s) of its elements for UE- dedicated Presence Reporting Area(s). (See Table 6.4 in clause 6.4 for details of the PRA Identifier(s) and the list(s) of elements comprising each Presence Reporting Area). If OCS is configured with a PRA identifier referring to the list of PRA Identifier(s) within a Set of Core Network predefined Presence Reporting Areas as defined in TS 23.401 [17], it activates the reporting of UE entering/leaving the individual PRA in the Set of Core Network predefined Presence Reporting Areas without providing the complete set of individual PRAs.\nThe OCS may change (activate/modify/remove) the Presence Reporting Area(s) to be reported by providing the updated PRA Identifier(s) to PCEF. For UE dedicated PRAs, the OCS may also change the list(s) of Presence Reporting Area elements related to the PRA Identifier(s).\nThe OCS may unsubscribe to Change of UE presence in Presence Reporting Area at any time during the life time of the credit management session.\nThe OCS may be notified during the life time of a credit management session that the UE is located in an access type where local OCS configuration indicates that reporting changes of UE presence in Presence Reporting Area is not supported. If so, the OCS unsubscribes to Change of UE presence in Presence Reporting Area, if previously activated.\nSome of the re-authorization triggers are related to IP‑CAN bearer modifications. IP‑CAN bearer modifications, which do not match any credit re-authorization trigger (received from the OCS for the bearer) shall not cause any credit re-authorization interaction with the OCS.\nIf the PCRF set the Out of credit event trigger (see clause 6.1.4), the PCEF/TDF shall inform the PCRF about the PCC/ADC rules for which credit is no longer available together with the applied termination action.",

The resource modification request received by PCEF/BBERF may include request for guaranteed bit rate changes for a traffic aggregate and/or the association/disassociation of the traffic aggregate with a QCI and/or a modification of the traffic aggregate.\nThe routing information change event trigger shall trigger the PCRF interaction for any change in how the IP flow is routed. The routing information change received by the PCEF is specified in TS 23.261 [23] (i.e. IP flow mobility routing rules) or TS 23.161 [43] (i.e. Routing Rules).\nThe enforced PCC rule request event trigger shall trigger a PCEF interaction to request PCC rules from the PCRF for an established IP‑CAN session. This PCEF interaction shall take place within the Revalidation time limit set by the PCRF in the IP‑CAN session related policy information (clause 6.4).\nThe enforced ADC rule request event trigger shall trigger a TDF interaction to request ADC rules from the PCRF for an established TDF session for solicited application reporting. This TDF interaction shall take place within the ADC Revalidation time limit set by the PCRF in the TDF session related policy information (clause 6.4).\nNOTE 3:\tThe enforced PCC rule request and the enforced ADC rule request mechanisms can be used to avoid signalling overload situations e.g. due to time of day based PCC/ADC rule changes.\nThe UE IP address change event trigger applies to the PCEF only and shall trigger a PCEF interaction with the PCRF in case a UE IPv4 address is allocated or released during the lifetime of the IP‑CAN session.\nThe Access Network Charging Correlation Information event shall trigger the PCEF to report the assigned access network charging identifier for the PCC rules that are accompanied with a request for this event at activation.\nTo activate usage monitoring, the PCRF shall set the Usage report event trigger and provide applicable usage thresholds for the Monitoring key(s) that are subject to usage monitoring in the requested node (PCEF or TDF, solicited application reporting). The PCRF shall not remove the Usage report event trigger while usage monitoring is still active in the PCEF/TDF.\nIf the Usage report event trigger is set and the volume or the time thresholds, earlier provided by the PCRF, are reached, the PCEF or TDF (whichever received the event trigger) shall report this event to the PCRF. If both volume and time thresholds were provided and the thresholds, for one of the measurements, are reached, the PCEF or TDF shall report this event to the PCRF and the accumulated usage since last report shall be reported for both measurements.\nThe Start of application traffic detection and Stop of application traffic detection events shall trigger an interaction with PCRF once the requested application traffic is detected (i.e. Start of application traffic detection) or the end of the requested application traffic is detected (i.e. Stop of application traffic detection) unless it is requested within a specific PCC Rule or ADC Rule to mute such a notification for solicited application reporting or unconditionally in case of unsolicited application reporting. The application identifier and service data flow descriptions, if deducible, shall also be included in the report. An application instance identifier shall be included in the report both for Start and for Stop of application traffic detection when service data flow descriptions are deducible. This is done to unambiguously match the Start and the Stop events.\nThe SRVCC CS to PS handover event trigger shall trigger a PCEF interaction with the PCRF to inform that a CS to PS handover procedure has been detected. The PCRF shall ensure, as specified in TS 23.216 [28], to allow voice media over the default bearer during the course of the CS to PS SRVCC procedure.\nAt PCC rule activation, modification and deactivation the ERF shall send, as specified in the PCC/QoS rule, the User Location Report and/or UE Timezone Report to the PCRF.\nNOTE 4:\tAt PCC rule deactivation the User Location Report includes information on when the UE was last known to be in that location.\nThe PCRF shall send the User Location Report and/or UE Timezone Report to the AF upon receiving an Access Network Information report corresponding to the AF session from the ERF.\nIf the event trigger for Access Network Information reporting is set, the ERF shall check the need for access network information reporting after successful installation/modification or removal of a PCC/QoS rule or upon termination of the IP-CAN session/bearer. The ERF shall check the Access Network Information report parameters (User Location Report, UE Timezone Report) of the PCC/QoS rules and report the access network information received in the corresponding IP-CAN bearer establishment, modification or termination procedure to the PCRF. The ERF shall not report any subsequent access network information updates received from the IP‑CAN without any previous updates of related PCC/QoS rules unless the associated IP-CAN bearer or connection has been released.\nIf the ERF receives a request to install/modify or remove a PCC/QoS rule with Access Network Information report parameters (User Location Report, UE Timezone Report) set and there is no bearer signalling related to this PCC/QoS rule (i.e. pending IP-CAN bearer signalling initiated by the UE or bearer signalling initiated by the ERF), the ERF shall initiate a bearer signalling to retrieve the current access network information of the UE and forward it to the PCRF afterwards.\nIf the Access Network Information report parameter for the User Location Report is set and the user location (e.g. cell) is not available to the ERF, the ERF shall provide the serving PLMN identifier to the PCRF which shall forward it to the AF.\nThe Credit management session failure event trigger shall trigger a PCEF or TDF interaction with the PCRF to inform about a credit management session failure and to indicate the failure reason, and the affected PCC/ADC rules.\nNOTE 5:\tAs a result, the PCRF may decide about e.g. TDF session termination, IP-CAN session termination (via PCC rule removal), perform gating of services in the PCEF/TDF, switch to offline charging, rating group change, etc.\nNOTE 6:\tFor the PCEF the Credit management session failure event trigger applies to situations wherein the IP‑CAN session is not terminated by the PCEF due to the credit management session failure.\nIf the UE resumed from suspend state event trigger is set and the UE is resumed from suspend state in EPC, the PCEF shall report this event to the PCRF. The PCEF shall not report any subsequent UE resumed from suspend state updates received from the IP‑CAN to the PCRF. When receiving the event report that the UE is resumed, the PCRF may provision PCC Rules to the PCEF to trigger an IP-CAN Session modification procedure.",

      "content": "Policy control comprises functionalities for:\n-\tBinding, i.e. the generation of an association between a service data flow and the IP‑CAN bearer transporting that service data flow;\n-\tGating control, i.e. the blocking or allowing of packets, belonging to a service data flow or specified by an application identifier, to pass through to the desired endpoint;\n-\tEvent reporting, i.e. the notification of and reaction to application events to trigger new behaviour in the user plane as well as the reporting of events related to the resources in the GW (PCEF);\n-\tQoS control, i.e. the authorisation and enforcement of the maximum QoS that is authorised for a service data flow, an Application identified by application identifier or an IP‑CAN bearer;\n-\tRedirection, i.e. the steering of packets, belonging to an application defined by the application identifier to the specified redirection address;\n-\tIP‑CAN bearer establishment for IP‑CANs that support network initiated procedures for IP‑CAN bearer establishment.\nIn case of an aggregation of multiple service data flows (e.g. for GPRS a PDP context), the combination of the authorised QoS information of the individual service data flows is provided as the authorised QoS for this aggregate.\nThe enforcement of the authorized QoS of the IP‑CAN bearer may lead to a downgrading or upgrading of the requested bearer QoS by the GW (PCEF) as part of a UE-initiated IP‑CAN bearer establishment or modification. Alternatively, the enforcement of the authorised QoS may, depending on operator policy and network capabilities, lead to network initiated IP‑CAN bearer establishment or modification. If the PCRF provides authorized QoS for both, the IP‑CAN bearer and PCC rule(s), the enforcement of authorized QoS of the individual PCC rules shall take place first.\nQoS authorization information may be dynamically provisioned by the PCRF or, if the conditions mentioned in clause 6.3.1 apply, it can be a predefined PCC rule in the PCEF. In case the PCRF provides PCC rules dynamically, authorised QoS information for the IP‑CAN bearer (combined QoS) may be provided. For a predefined PCC rules within the PCEF the authorized QoS information shall take affect when the PCC rule is activated. The PCEF shall combine the different sets of authorized QoS information, i.e. the information received from the PCRF and the information corresponding to the predefined PCC rules. The PCRF shall know the authorized QoS information of the predefined PCC rules and shall take this information into account when activating them. This ensures that the combined authorized QoS of a set of PCC rules that are activated by the PCRF is within the limitations given by the subscription and operator policies regardless of whether these PCC rules are dynamically provided, predefined or both.\nFor policy control, the AF interacts with the PCRF and the PCRF interacts with the PCEF as instructed by the AF. For certain events related to policy control, the AF shall be able to give instructions to the PCRF to act on its own, i.e. based on the service information currently available. The following events are subject to instructions from the AF:\n-\tThe authorization of the service based on incomplete service information;\nNOTE 1:\tThe QoS authorization based on incomplete service information is required for e.g. IMS session setup scenarios with available resources on originating side and a need for resource reservation on terminating side.\n-\tThe immediate authorization of the service;\n-\tThe gate control (i.e. whether there is a common gate handling per AF session or an individual gate handling per AF session component required);\n-\tThe forwarding of IP‑CAN bearer level information or events:\n-\tType of IP‑CAN (e.g. GPRS, etc.);\n-\tTransmission resource status (established/released/lost);\n-\tAccess Network Charging Correlation Information;\n-\tCredit denied.\nNOTE 2:\tThe credit denied information is only relevant for AFs not performing service charging.\nTo enable the binding functionality, the UE and the AF shall provide all available flow description information (e.g. source and destination IP address and port numbers and the protocol information). The UE shall use the traffic mapping information to indicate downlink and uplink IP flows.\nIf PCEF indicates that a PDN connection is carried over satellite access (of WB-E-UTRAN, NB-IoT or LTE-M RAT Types and specific values as defined in TS 23.401 [17]), the PCRF may take this information into account for the policy decision, e.g. together with any delay requirements provided by the AF.",

If this pre-emption priority is greater than that of any one or more active PCC rules, the PCRF can determine whether the deactivation of any one or more such rules would allow the higher pre-emption priority PCC rule to be activated whilst ensuring the resulting cumulative QoS does not exceed a subscriber's Subscribed Guaranteed Bandwidth QoS.\nIf such a determination can be made, the PCRF may resolve the conflict by deactivating those selected PCC rules with lower pre-emption priorities and accepting the higher priority service information from the AF.

The characteristics describe the packet forwarding treatment that an SDF aggregate receives edge-to-edge between the UE and the PCEF (see figure 6.1.7‑1) in terms of the following performance characteristics:\n1\tResource Type (GBR or Non-GBR);\n2\tPriority;\n3\tPacket Delay Budget;\n4\tPacket Error Loss Rate;\n5\tMaximum Data Burst Volume (for some GBR QCIs);\n6\tData Rate Averaging Window (for some GBR QCIs).\nFigure 6.1.7-1: Scope of the Standardized QCI characteristics for client/server (upper figure) and peer/peer (lower figure) communication\nThe standardized characteristics are not signalled on any interface. They should be understood as guidelines for the pre-configuration of node specific parameters for each QCI. The goal of standardizing a QCI with corresponding characteristics is to ensure that applications / services mapped to that QCI receive the same minimum level of QoS in multi-vendor network deployments and in case of roaming. A standardized QCI and corresponding characteristics is independent of the UE's current access (3GPP or Non-3GPP).\nThe one-to-one mapping of standardized QCI values to standardized characteristics is captured in table 6.1.7-A and table 6.1.7-B. The main differences between the two parts are that, in contrast to Part A, Part B of Table 6.1.7 describes QCIs for which the Packet Error Loss Rate calculation includes those packets that are not delivered within the Packet Delay Budget; and, it provides additional information on the Data Rate Averaging Window as well as the Maximum Data Burst Volume that needs to be delivered within the Packet Delay Budget.\nTable 6.1.7-A: Standardized QCI characteristics\nQCI\nResource Type\nPriority Level\nPacket Delay Budget\n(NOTE 13)\nPacket Error Loss\nRate (NOTE 2)\nExample Services\n1(NOTE 3)\n2\n100 ms(NOTE 1, NOTE 11)\n10-2\nConversational Voice\n2(NOTE 3)\nGBR\n4\n150 ms(NOTE 1, NOTE 11)\n10-3\nConversational Video (Live Streaming)\n3(NOTE 3, NOTE 14)\n3\n50 ms(NOTE 1, NOTE 11)\n10-3\nReal Time Gaming, V2X messages\nElectricity distribution - medium voltage (e.g. clause 7.2.2 of TS 22.261 [51])\nProcess automation - monitoring (e.g. clause 7.2.2 of TS 22.261 [51])\n4(NOTE 3)\n5\n300 ms(NOTE 1, NOTE 11)\n10-6\nNon-Conversational Video (Buffered Streaming)\n65(NOTE 3, NOTE 9, NOTE 12)\n0.7\n75 ms(NOTE 7,NOTE 8)\n10-2\nMission Critical user plane Push To Talk voice (e.g., MCPTT)\n66(NOTE 3, NOTE 12)\n2\n100 ms(NOTE 1,NOTE 10)\n10-2\nNon-Mission-Critical user plane Push To Talk voice\n67(NOTE 3, NOTE 12)\n1.5\n100 ms(NOTE 1,NOTE 10)\n10-3\nMission Critical Video user plane\n75(NOTE 14)\n2.5\n50 ms(NOTE 1)\n10-2\nV2X messages\n71\n5.6\n150ms\n(NOTE 1, NOTE 16)\n10-6\n\"Live\" Uplink Streaming (e.g. TS 26.238 [53])\n72\n5.6\n300ms\n(NOTE 1, NOTE 16)\n10-4\n\"Live\" Uplink Streaming (e.g. TS 26.238 [53])\n73\n5.6\n300ms\n(NOTE 1, NOTE 16)\n10-8\n\"Live\" Uplink Streaming (e.g. TS 26.238 [53])\n74\n5.6\n500ms\n(NOTE 1, NOTE 16)\n10-8\n\"Live\" Uplink Streaming (e.g. TS 26.238 [53])\n76\n5.6\n500ms\n(NOTE 1, NOTE 16)\n10-4\n\"Live\" Uplink Streaming (e.g. TS 26.238 [53])\n5(NOTE 3)\n1\n100 ms(NOTE 1, NOTE 10)\n10-6\nIMS Signalling\n6(NOTE 4)\n6\n300 ms(NOTE 1, NOTE 10)\n10-6\nVideo (Buffered Streaming)TCP-based (e.g., www, e-mail, chat, ftp, p2p file sharing, progressive video, etc.)\n7(NOTE 3)\nNon-GBR\n7\n100 ms(NOTE 1, NOTE 10)\n10-3\nVoice,Video (Live Streaming)Interactive Gaming\n8(NOTE 5)\n8\n300 ms(NOTE 1)\n10-6\nVideo (Buffered Streaming)TCP-based (e.g., www, e-mail, chat, ftp, p2p file\n9(NOTE 6)\n9\nsharing, progressive video, etc.)\n10\n9\n1100 ms\n(NOTE 1, NOTE 17)\n10-6\nVideo (Buffered Streaming)\nTCP-based (e.g. www, e-mail, chat, ftp, p2p file sharing, progressive video, etc.) and any service that can be used over satellite access with these characteristics\n69(NOTE 3, NOTE 9, NOTE 12)\n0.5\n60 ms(NOTE 7, NOTE 8)\n10-6\nMission Critical delay sensitive signalling (e.g., MC-PTT signalling, MC Video signalling)\n70(NOTE 4, NOTE 12)\n5.5\n200 ms(NOTE 7, NOTE 10)\n10-6\nMission Critical Data (e.g. example services are the same as QCI 6/8/9)\n79(NOTE 14)\n6.5\n50 ms(NOTE 1, NOTE 10)\n10-2\nV2X messages\n80(NOTE 3)\n6.8\n10 ms(NOTE 10, NOTE 15)\n10-6\nLow latency eMBB applications (TCP/UDP-based);\nAugmented Reality\nNOTE 1:\tA delay of 20 ms for the delay between a PCEF and a radio base station should be subtracted from a given PDB to derive the packet delay budget that applies to the radio interface. This delay is the average between the case where the PCEF is located \"close\" to the radio base station (roughly 10 ms) and the case where the PCEF is located \"far\" from the radio base station, e.g. in case of roaming with home routed traffic (the one-way packet delay between Europe and the US west coast is roughly 50 ms). The average takes into account that roaming is a less typical scenario. It is expected that subtracting this average delay of 20 ms from a given PDB will lead to desired end-to-end performance in most typical cases. Also, note that the PDB defines an upper bound. Actual packet delays - in particular for GBR traffic - should typically be lower than the PDB specified for a QCI as long as the UE has sufficient radio channel quality.\nNOTE 2:\tThe rate of non congestion related packet losses that may occur between a radio base station and a PCEF should be regarded to be negligible. A PELR value specified for a standardized QCI therefore applies completely to the radio interface between a UE and radio base station.\nNOTE 3:\tThis QCI is typically associated with an operator controlled service, i.e., a service where the SDF aggregate's uplink / downlink packet filters are known at the point in time when the SDF aggregate is authorized. In case of E-UTRAN this is the point in time when a corresponding dedicated EPS bearer is established / modified.\nNOTE 4:\tIf the network supports Multimedia Priority Services (MPS) then this QCI could be used for the prioritization of non real-time data (i.e. most typically TCP-based services/applications) of MPS subscribers.\nNOTE 5:\tThis QCI could be used for a dedicated \"premium bearer\" (e.g. associated with premium content) for any subscriber / subscriber group. Also in this case, the SDF aggregate's uplink / downlink packet filters are known at the point in time when the SDF aggregate is authorized. Alternatively, this QCI could be used for the default bearer of a UE/PDN for \"premium subscribers\".\nNOTE 6:\tThis QCI is typically used for the default bearer of a UE/PDN for non privileged subscribers. Note that AMBR can be used as a \"tool\" to provide subscriber differentiation between subscriber groups connected to the same PDN with the same QCI on the default bearer.\nNOTE 7:\tFor Mission Critical services, it may be assumed that the PCEF is located \"close\" to the radio base station (roughly 10 ms) and is not normally used in a long distance, home routed roaming situation. Hence delay of 10 ms for the delay between a PCEF and a radio base station should be subtracted from this PDB to derive the packet delay budget that applies to the radio interface.\nNOTE 8:\tIn both RRC Idle and RRC Connected mode, the PDB requirement for these QCIs can be relaxed (but not to a value greater than 320 ms) for the first packet(s) in a downlink data or signalling burst in order to permit reasonable battery saving (DRX) techniques.\nNOTE 9:\tIt is expected that QCI-65 and QCI-69 are used together to provide Mission Critical Push to Talk service (e.g., QCI-5 is not used for signalling for the bearer that utilizes QCI-65 as user plane bearer). It is expected that the amount of traffic per UE will be similar or less compared to the IMS signalling.\nNOTE 10:\tIn both RRC Idle and RRC Connected mode, the PDB requirement for these QCIs can be relaxed for the first packet(s) in a downlink data or signalling burst in order to permit battery saving (DRX) techniques.\nNOTE 11:\tIn RRC Idle mode, the PDB requirement for these QCIs can be relaxed for the first packet(s) in a downlink data or signalling burst in order to permit battery saving (DRX) techniques.\nNOTE 12:\tThis QCI value can only be assigned upon request from the network side. The UE and any application running on the UE is not allowed to request this QCI value.\nNOTE 13:\tPacket delay budget is not applicable on NB-IoT or when Enhanced Coverage is used for WB-E-UTRAN (see TS 36.300 [19]).\nNOTE 14:\tThis QCI could be used for transmission of V2X messages as defined in TS 23.285 [48].\nNOTE 15:\tA delay of 2 ms for the delay between a PCEF and a radio base station should be subtracted from the given PDB to derive the packet delay budget that applies to the radio interface.\nNOTE 16:\tFor \"live\" uplink streaming (see TS 26.238 [53]), guidelines for PDB values of the different QCIs correspond to the latency configurations defined in TR 26.939 [54]. In order to support higher latency reliable streaming services (above 500ms PDB), if different PDB and PELR combinations are needed these configurations will have to use non-standardised QCIs.\nNOTE 17:\tThe worst case one way propagation delay for GEO satellite is expected to be ~270 ms, ~ 21 ms for LEO at 1200 km, and ~13 ms for LEO at 600 km. The UL scheduling delay that needs to be added is also typically a two way propagation delay e.g. ~540 ms for GEO, ~42 ms for LEO at 1200 km, and ~26 ms for LEO at 600 km. Based on that, the access network Packet delay budget is not applicable for QCIs that require access network PDB lower than the sum of these values when the specific types of satellite access are used (see TS 36.300 [19]). QCI-10 can accommodate the worst case PDB for GEO satellite type.\nTable 6.1.7-B: Standardized QCI characteristics\nQCI\nResource Type\nPriority Level\nPacket Delay Budget (NOTE B1)\nPacket Error Loss\nRate (NOTE B2)\nMaximum Data Burst Volume\n(NOTE B1)\nData Rate Averaging Window\nExample Services\n82\n(NOTE B6)\nGBR\n1.9\n10 ms\n(NOTE B4)\n10-4\n(NOTE B3)\n255 bytes\n2000 ms\nDiscrete Automation (TS 22.278 [38], clause 8 bullet g, and TS 22.261 [51], table 7.2.2-1, \"small packets\")\n83\n(NOTE B6)\n2.2\n10 ms\n(NOTE B4)\n10-4\n(NOTE B3)\n1354 bytes\n(NOTE B5)\n2000 ms\nDiscrete Automation (TS 22.278 [38], clause 8 bullet g, and TS 22.261 [51], table 7.2.2-1, \"big packets\")\n84\n(NOTE B6)\n2.4\n30 ms\n(NOTE B7)\n10-5\n(NOTE B3)\n1354 bytes\n(NOTE B5)\n2000 ms\nIntelligent Transport Systems (TS 22.278 [38], clause 8, bullet h, and TS 22.261 [51], table 7.2.2).\n85\n(NOTE B6)\n2.1\n5 ms\n(NOTE B8)\n10-5\n(NOTE B3)\n255 bytes\n2000 ms\nElectricity Distribution- high voltage (TS 22.278 [38], clause 8, bullet i, and TS 22.261 [51], table 7.2.2 and Annex D, clause D.4.2).\nNOTE B1:\tThe PDB applies to bursts that are not greater than Maximum Data Burst Volume.\nNOTE B2:\tThis Packet Error Loss Rate includes packets that are not successfully delivered over the access network plus those packets that comply with the Maximum Data Burst Volume and GBR requirements but which are not delivered within the Packet Delay Budget.\nNOTE B3:\tData rates above the GBR, or, bursts larger than the Maximum Data Burst Volume, are treated as best effort, and, in order to serve other packets and meet the PELR, this can lead to them being discarded.\nNOTE B4:\tA delay of 1 ms for the delay between a PCEF and a radio base station should be subtracted from a given PDB to derive the packet delay budget that applies to the radio interface.\nNOTE B5:\tThis Maximum Data Burst Volume value is set to 1354 bytes to avoid IP fragmentation on an IPv6 based, IPSec protected GTP tunnel to the eNB (the value is calculated as in Annex C of TS 23.060 [12] and further reduced by 4 bytes to allow for the usage of a GTP-U extension header).\nNOTE B6:\tThis QCI is typically associated with a dedicated EPS bearer.\nNOTE B7:\tA delay of 5 ms for the delay between a PCEF and a radio base station should be subtracted from a given PDB to derive the packet delay budget that applies to the radio interface.\nNOTE B8:\tA delay of 2 ms for the delay between a PCEF and a radio base station should be subtracted from a given PDB to derive the packet delay budget that applies to the radio interface.\nThe Resource Type determines if dedicated network resources related to a service or bearer level Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) value are permanently allocated (e.g. by an admission control function in a radio base station). GBR SDF aggregates are therefore typically authorized \"on demand\" which requires dynamic policy and charging control. A Non GBR SDF aggregate may be pre-authorized through static policy and charging control.\nThe Maximum Data Burst Volume, if defined for the QCI (see Table 6.1.7-B), is the amount of data which the RAN is expected to deliver within the part of the Packet Delay Budget allocated to the link between the UE and the radio base station as long as the data is within the GBR requirements. If more data is transmitted from the application, delivery within the Packet Delay Budget cannot be guaranteed for packets exceeding the Maximum Data Burst Volume or GBR requirements.\nThe Data Rate Averaging Window, if defined for the QCI (see Table 6.1.7-B), is the 'sliding window' duration over which the GBR and MBR for a GBR SDF aggregate shall be calculated (e.g. in the RAN, PDN-GW, and UE).\nThe Packet Delay Budget (PDB) defines an upper bound for the time that a packet may be delayed between the UE and the PCEF. For a certain QCI the value of the PDB is the same in uplink and downlink. The purpose of the PDB is to support the configuration of scheduling and link layer functions (e.g. the setting of scheduling priority weights and HARQ target operating points). Except for QCIs 82 and 83, the PDB shall be interpreted as a maximum delay with a confidence level of 98 percent. For services using QCI 82 or 83, a packet delayed by more than the PDB is included in the calculation of the PELR if the packet is within the Maximum Data Burst Volume and GBR requirements.\nNOTE 1:\tThe PDB denotes a \"soft upper bound\" in the sense that an \"expired\" packet, e.g. a link layer SDU that has exceeded the PDB, does not need to be discarded (e.g. by RLC in E-UTRAN). The discarding (dropping) of packets is expected to be controlled by a queue management function, e.g. based on pre-configured dropping thresholds.\nThe support for SRVCC requires QCI=1 only be used for IMS speech sessions in accordance to TS 23.216 [28].\nNOTE 2:\tTriggering SRVCC will cause service interruption and/or inconsistent service experience when using QCI=1 for non-IMS services.\nNOTE 3:\tTriggering SRVCC for WebRTC IMS session will cause service interruption and/or inconsistent service experience when using QCI=1. Operator policy (e.g. use of specific AF application identifier) can be used to avoid using QCI 1 for a voice service, e.g. WebRTC IMS session.\nServices using a Non-GBR QCI should be prepared to experience congestion related packet drops, and, except for QCI 80, 98 percent of the packets that have not been dropped due to congestion should not experience a delay exceeding the QCI's PDB. This may for example occur during traffic load peaks or when the UE becomes coverage limited. See Annex J for details. Packets that have not been dropped due to congestion may still be subject to non congestion related packet losses (see PELR below). Owing to its low latency objective, services using QCI 80 should anticipate that more than 2 percent of packets might exceed the PDB of QCI 80.\nExcept for services using QCI 82 or 83 services using a GBR QCI and sending at a rate smaller than or equal to GBR can in general assume that congestion related packet drops will not occur, and 98 percent of the packets shall not experience a delay exceeding the QCI's PDB. Exceptions (e.g. transient link outages) can always occur in a radio access system which may then lead to congestion related packet drops even for services using a GBR QCI and sending at a rate smaller than or equal to GBR. Packets that have not been dropped due to congestion may still be subject to non congestion related packet losses (see PELR below). For services using QCI 82 or 83 a packet which is delayed by more than the PDB but is within the Maximum Data Burst Volume and GBR requirements, is counted as lost when calculating the PELR.\nEvery QCI (GBR and Non-GBR) is associated with a Priority level (see Table 6.1.7). The lowest Priority level value corresponds to the highest Priority. The Priority levels shall be used to differentiate between SDF aggregates of the same UE, and it shall also be used to differentiate between SDF aggregates from different UEs. Via its QCI an SDF aggregate is associated with a Priority level and a PDB. Scheduling between different SDF aggregates shall primarily be based on the PDB. If the target set by the PDB can no longer be met for one or more SDF aggregate(s) across all UEs that have sufficient radio channel quality then the QCI Priority level shall be used as follows: in this case a scheduler shall meet the PDB of an SDF aggregate on QCI Priority level N in preference to meeting the PDB of SDF aggregates on next QCI Priority level greater than N, until the priority N SDF aggregate's GBR (in case of a GBR SDF aggregate) has been satisfied.\nOther aspects related to the treatment of traffic exceeding an SDF aggregate's GBR are out of scope of this specification.\nWhen required by operator policy, the eNodeB can be configured to use the ARP priority level in addition to the QCI priority level to determine the relative priority of the SDFs in meeting the PDB of an SDF aggregate. This configuration applies only for high priority ARPs as defined in clause 6.1.7.3.\nNOTE 4:\tThe definition (or quantification) of \"sufficient radio channel quality\" is out of the scope of 3GPP specifications.\nNOTE 5:\tIn case of E-UTRAN a QCI's Priority level, and when required by operator policy, the ARP priority level may be used as the basis for assigning the uplink priority per Radio Bearer (see TS 36.300 [19] for details).\nThe Packet Error Loss Rate (PELR) defines an upper bound for the rate of SDUs (e.g. IP packets) that have been processed by the sender of a link layer protocol (e.g. RLC in E‑UTRAN) but that are not successfully delivered by the corresponding receiver to the upper layer (e.g. PDCP in E‑UTRAN). Thus, the PELR defines an upper bound for a rate of non congestion related packet losses. The purpose of the PELR is to allow for appropriate link layer protocol configurations (e.g. RLC and HARQ in E‑UTRAN).

The priority level defines the relative importance of a resource request. This allows deciding whether a bearer establishment or modification request can be accepted or needs to be rejected in case of resource limitations (typically used for admission control of GBR traffic). It can also be used to decide which existing bearers to pre-empt during resource limitations.\nNOTE 1:\tThe ARP priority level can be used in addition to the QCI to determine the transport level packet marking, e.g. to set the DiffServ Code Point of the associated EPS bearer, as described in TS 23.401 [17].\nNOTE 2:\tWhen required by operator policy, the eNodeB can be configured to use the ARP priority level in addition to QCI priority level to control the packet forwarding treatment for SDFs having high priority ARPs.\nThe range of the ARP priority level is 1 to 15 with 1 as the highest level of priority. The pre-emption capability information defines whether a service data flow can get resources that were already assigned to another service data flow with a lower priority level. The pre-emption vulnerability information defines whether a service data flow can lose the resources assigned to it in order to admit a service data flow with higher priority level. The pre-emption capability and the pre-emption vulnerability can be either set to 'yes' or 'no'.\nThe ARP priority levels 1-8 should only be assigned to resources for services that are authorized to receive prioritized treatment within an operator domain (i.e. that are authorized by the serving network). The ARP priority levels 9-15 may be assigned to resources that are authorized by the home network and thus applicable when a UE is roaming.\nNOTE 3:\tThis ensures that future releases may use ARP priority level 1-8 to indicate e.g. emergency and other priority services within an operator domain in a backward compatible manner. This does not prevent the use of ARP priority level 1-8 in roaming situation in case appropriate roaming agreements exist that ensure a compatible use of these priority levels.",

The PCC/QoS rules may restrict what traffic is allowed compared to what is explicitly negotiated with the UE. The PCRF may, per service data flow filter, indicate that the PCEF/BBERF is required to explicitly signal the corresponding traffic mapping information to the UE, e.g. for the purpose of IMS precondition handling at the UE. In absence of that indication, it is a PCEF/BBERF decision whether to signal the traffic mapping information that is redundant from a traffic mapping point of view.\nNOTE 1:\tA new/modified PCC/QoS rule can cause that previously redundant, and therefore omitted, traffic mapping information to cease being redundant and causing the PCEF/BBERF to signal the corresponding traffic mapping information to the UE.\nNOTE 2:\tIn order to signal a specific traffic mapping to a PDP context/EPS bearer without any previous TFT, if the operator policy is to continue allowing previously allowed traffic on that bearer, TFT filters that correspond to the previous traffic mapping need to be introduced as well.\nNOTE 3:\tThe PCEF/BERF can use all SDF filters for the generation of traffic mapping information. However if the number of SDF filters for an IP-CAN bearer exceeds the maximum number of filters that may be signalled to the UE (e.g. as specified in TS 24.008 [50]) another bearer needs to be established and a rebinding of PCC rules to bearers (by PCEF/BBERF) or even the splitting of the SDF template into two or more PCC rules (by PCRF) may be required.\nThe traffic mapping information (e.g. TFT filters for GPRS and EPS) that the network provides to the UE shall include the same content as the corresponding SDF filters in the SDF template received over the Gx/Gxx interface. The representation/format of the packet filters provided by the network to the UE is access-system dependent and may vary between accesses and may also be different from the representation/format of the SDF filters in the SDF template on the Gx/Gxx interface.\nNOTE 4:\tAfter handover from one access-system to another, if the UE needs to determine the QoS provided in the target access to the pre-existing IP flows in the source access, the UE can perform packet filter comparison between the packet filters negotiated in the old access and those provided by the target access during QoS resource activation.\nNOTE 5:\tIf UE initiated procedures are supported and handover between access systems is to be supported, the content of the packet filters provided on the Gx/Gxx interface by the PCRF is restricted to the packet filter fields that all the accesses can provide to the UE.\nIn case traffic mapping information is required for a dedicated bearer and in the PCC/QoS rules corresponding to the bearer there is no SDF filter for the uplink direction having an indication to signal corresponding traffic mapping information to the UE, the PCEF/BBERF derives traffic mapping information based on implementation specific logic (e.g. traffic mapping information that effectively disallows any useful packet flows in uplink direction as described in clause 15.3.3.4 of TS 23.060 [12]) and provides it to the UE.\nNOTE 6:\tFor GPRS and EPS, the state of TFT packet filters, as defined in TS 23.060 [12], for an IP-CAN session requires that there is at most one bearer with no TFT packet filter for the uplink direction.\nNOTE 7:\tThis PCEF behaviour covers also the case that a PCC rule with an application identifier is the only PCC rule that is bound to a dedicated bearer.\nNOTE 8:\tFor a default bearer, the PCEF/BBERF will not add traffic mapping information that effectively disallows any useful packet flows in uplink direction on its own.

Traffic steering control information consists of a traffic description and a reference to a traffic steering policy that is configured in the PCEF, TDF or TSSF.\nThe PCEF, TDF or TSSF performs necessary actions to enforce the traffic steering policy referenced by the PCRF. For enforcing the traffic steering policy, the PCEF, TDF or TSSF may support traffic steering related functions as defined by other standard organizations. The mechanism used for routing the traffic between the service functions within the (S)Gi-LAN, is out of 3GPP scope.\nThe traffic steering control may be deployed using PCEF only, using TDF only, or using TSSF only, or using a combination of PCEF/TDF and TSSF.\nWhen a combination of PCEF/TDF with traffic steering control feature and TSSF is deployed, the PCEF/TDF is utilized for application detection and packet marking while traffic steering is done using TSSF. In this case the PCC/ADC Rules provided to the PCEF/TDF for application detection shall be at application level while the traffic steering control information provided to the TSSF for traffic detection and steering control shall be at service data flow level only, i.e. the Application identifier and Traffic steering policy identifier shall be included over Gx/Sd reference point for detection of the traffic and packet marking, and the Service data flow filter(s) and Traffic steering policy identifier shall be included over St reference point for traffic steering control.

This deployment scenario is applicable for applications with deducible service data flow filters only. In this case, the PCEF/TDF deduces the downlink service data flow description and communicates the related information to the downlink classifier.\nNOTE 2:\tThe SDF filter(s) can be used for traffic detection at the TSSF when the PCEF/TDF is configured to do packet marking and forwarding using ToS or TC values in the IP header.

The PCRF takes a policy decision on whether NBIFOM may apply to the IP-CAN session (the hPCRF decides the NBIFOM mode according to TS 23.161 [43]) and informs the PCEF about its decision.\n-\tAddition of an access.\nWhen the PCEF receives both a handover request and a NBIFOM indication from the UE, the PCEF initiates an IP-CAN Session Modification procedure, to:\n-\tNotify the PCRF about the addition of an access to the IP-CAN session together with the IP-CAN type and the RAT type of this access.

In this release of the specification the only allowed combination corresponds to the UE using a 3GPP access and a WLAN access.\n-\tIf network-initiated NBIFOM mode was selected at IP-CAN session establishment, the PCRF indicates the default NBIFOM access to the PCEF.\n-\tIn UE-initiated NBIFOM mode the PCRF verifies the default NBIFOM access provided by the UE. If it complies with the subscription the PCRF provides this default NBIFOM access to the PCEF. If not, the PCRF selects a different default NBIFOM access and provides it to the PCEF.\n-\tIn UE-initiated NBIFOM mode, the PCRF may receive NBIFOM Routing Rules created by the UE. The PCRF may reject a NBIFOM Routing Rule due to subscription limitations. Otherwise, the PCRF determines for each NBIFOM Routing Rule the impacted PCC rule and provides or modifies this PCC rule.\n-\tThe PCRF shall ensure that there is at least one PCC Rule that can be bound to the default bearer of each access.\n-\tRemoval of an access.\nWhen the PCEF is informed about the removal of an access of a multi-access IP-CAN session, the PCEF initiates an IP-CAN Session Modification procedure, to notify the PCRF about the removal of an access together with the IP-CAN type and the RAT type of this access. The PCRF determines the affected PCC rules and replies with updated PCC Rules or informs about the PCC Rules that are to be removed.\nThe PCC rules corresponding to the removed access are then modified or deleted by the PCEF accordingly. This shall not trigger the sending of Routing Rules deletion to the UE in Network-initiated NBIFOM mode.\nNOTE 2:\tThe UE deletes the Routing Rules locally in case of removal of access as described in TS 23.161 [43].\nNOTE 3:\tThe PCRF can also decide to trigger the removal of an access by updating or removing all PCC rules that are bound to this access. The removal of all PCC Rules bound to an access removes the access unless there are PCC Rules not known to the PCRF defined in the PCEF for this particular access.\n-\tNetwork-initiated IP flow mobility within a PDN connection (Network-initiated NBIFOM mode).\nWhen a multi-access IP-CAN session has been set-up in Network-initiated NBIFOM mode, the PCRF may at any time determine that flows should be moved from a source access to a target access. In that case, the PCRF provides updated PCC Rules with a modified Allowed Access Type and the Routing Rule Identifier using an IP-CAN Session Modification procedure (i.e. the Allowed Access Type can be added, changed or removed).\nThe PCRF request triggers the sending of Routing Rules creation (when the Allowed Access Type is added) or Routing Rules modification (when the Allowed Access Type is changed) to the UE which may be rejected by the UE due to local radio conditions. In that case the PCRF gets notified which PCC rules cannot be modified. This notification from the PCEF contains an indication of the cause of the rejection received from the UE.\nThe PCRF request triggers the sending of Routing Rules deletion to the UE when the Allowed Access Type is removed.\n-\tUE-initiated IP flow mobility within a PDN connection (UE-initiated NBIFOM mode).\nWhen the PCEF has received a request from the UE to create / modify / delete a Routing Rule, the PCEF initiates an IP-CAN Session Modification procedure and provides the Routing Rule received from the UE to the PCRF as an NBIFOM Routing Rule. The PCRF may reject an NBIFOM Routing Rule received from the UE due to subscription limitations. Otherwise the PCRF determines and updates the impacted PCC rule (as described in 6.12.2) and provides the updated PCC rule to the PCEF.\n-\tUE requested mapping of IP flows to an access (Network-initiated NBIFOM mode).\nThis procedure is only used in Network-initiated NBIFOM mode when the UE wants to request the network to apply specific mappings of IP flows to an access.\nWhen the PCEF has received a request from the UE to have the network create / modify / delete a Routing Rule, the PCEF initiates an IP-CAN Session Modification procedure and provides the information received from the UE to the PCRF as an NBIFOM Routing Rule. The PCRF may reject an NBIFOM Routing Rule received from the UE due to subscription limitations. Otherwise the PCRF determines and updates the impacted PCC rule (as described in clause 6.12.2) and provides the updated PCC rule to the PCEF.

For every PCC rule that is currently bound to this access, the PCRF shall either change the Allowed Access Type and provide the updated PCC rule to the PCEF or remove this PCC rule. This triggers the sending of Routing Rules modification to the UE. If the PCRF receives an indication that an access become usable again, The PCRF may update the PCC rules, e.g. by changing the Allowed Access Type and provide the updated PCC rules to the PCEF. This triggers the sending of Routing Rules modification to the UE.\n-\tReporting Access Network Information to the AF.\nThe PCRF reports to the AF only Access Network Information associated with one access even though different media of the AF session are carried by different accesses.\nIf the PCRF has received a request for Access Network Information from the AF and PCC rules related with the AF request are bound to multiple accesses, the PCRF selects one PCC rule to be associated with Access Network Information reporting from the PCEF. The selected PCC rule should correspond to the 3GPP access: Using the 3GPP access reduces the risk of getting non-trustable location information from the S2b access of the IP-CAN session.\n-\tUE resource request for a multi-access IP-CAN session.\nWhen the UE wants to request the network to allocate resources for one or more IP flows in the non-default NBIFOM access, the UE shall provide a corresponding Routing Rule in the same request in the UE-initiated mode. Without such Routing Rule, the network shall reject the UE resource request.\nNOTE 4:\tUE resource requests in the default NBIFOM access do not require a Routing Rule as the generated PCC rule will be bound to dedicated bearer in this access.\n-\tPCRF initiated IP-CAN session modification.\nWhen network-initiated NBIFOM mode applies and the PCRF modifies the service data flow filter or precedence in a PCC rule for which a corresponding Routing Rule exists, the PCEF shall also modify this Routing Rule at the UE accordingly.\nWhen network-initiated NBIFOM mode applies and the PCRF removes a PCC rule for which a corresponding Routing Rule exists, the PCEF shall also remove the corresponding Routing Rule at the UE.\nWhen UE-initiated NBIFOM mode applies and if a new PCC rule is created due to the request from the network (e.g. request from the AF or application detection information from the PCEF/TDF), the PCRF shall determine that the new PCC rule is bound to the default access.

In this case, the AF will provide a priority sharing indicator in addition to the application identifier and the service priority. For MCPTT, the service priority and the priority sharing indicator are defined in TS 23.179 [46]. The priority sharing indicator is used to indicate what media flows are allowed to share priority.\nThe PCRF makes authorization and policy decisions for the affected AF sessions individually and generates a PCC/QoS rule for every media flow as specified in clause 6.1.1.3. The application identifier and the service priority are used to calculate the ARP priority. The AF may also provide suggested pre-emption capability and vulnerability values per media flow to the PCRF. The ARP pre-emption capability and the ARP pre-emption vulnerability are set according to operator policies and regulatory requirements, also taking into consideration the application identifier and suggested values, when provided by the AF. The priority sharing indicator is stored for later use.\nFor PCC/QoS rules with the same QCI assigned and having an associated priority sharing indicator, the PCRF shall try to make authorization and policy decisions taking the priority sharing indicator into account and modify the ARP of these PCC/QoS rules as follows, (the original ARP values are stored for later use):\n-\tThe modified ARP priority is set to the highest of the original priority among all the PCC/QoS rules that include the priority sharing indicator;\n-\tThe modified ARP pre-emption capability is set if any of the original PCC/QoS rules have the ARP pre-emption capability set;\n-\tThe modified ARP pre-emption vulnerability is set if all the original PCC/QoS rules have the ARP pre-emption vulnerability set.\nNOTE 1:\tHaving the same setting for the ARP parameter in the PCC/QoS rules with the priority sharing indicator set enables the usage of the same bearer. Furthermore, a combined modification of the ARP parameter in the PCC/QoS rules ensures that a bearer modification is triggered when a media flow with higher service priority starts.\nIf the PCRF receives an indication that a PCC/QoS rule provisioning or modification failed (due to resource reservation failure) then, the PCRF may apply pre-emption and remove active PCC/QoS rules from the PCEF and then retry the PCC/QoS rule provisioning or modification procedure. If the PCRF does not apply pre-emption, the AF is notified using existing procedures (as defined in clause 6.1.5) that the resource reservation for the new media flow failed.\nThe AF may optionally provide pre-emption control information, including pre-emption capability and vulnerability values, in addition to the priority sharing indicator to the PCRF. If so, the PCRF shall apply pre-emption and remove active PCC/QoS rules according to this information when receiving an indication that a PCC/QoS rule provisioning or modification failed.

When a removed/modified PFD was used to detect application traffic related to an application identifier in a PCC/ADC Rule of an IP-CAN/TDF session and the PCEF/TDF has reported the application start as described in clause 4.5 to the PCRF for the application instance corresponding to this PFD, the PCEF/TDF shall report the application stop to the PCRF for the corresponding application instance identifier if the removed/modified PFD in PCEF/TDF results in that the stop of the application instance is not being able to be detected.\nNOTE 1:\tThe management of Packet Flow Descriptions is optional, and is only used if the PFDF is deployed and the PCEF or the TDF supports this feature.\nEach PFD may be identified by a PFD id. A PFD id is unique in the scope of a particular application identifier. There may be different PFD types associated to an application identifier, see TS 23.682 [42] for the definition of PFD.\nThe PFDs may be retrieved by PCEF/TDF from PFDF in \"pull\" mode or may be provisioned from PFDF to the PCEF/TDF in \"push\" mode.\nWhen the \"push\" mode is used, the PFDF distributes PFDs for each application identifier to those PCEFs/TDFs that enable access to those applications. The PFDF may be configured with the list of PCEFs/TDFs where PFDs should be distributed. There are three methods to provision PFDs from the PFDF to the PCEF/TDF, as described in clause 7.12.2:\na)\tPush of whole PFDF state according to operator configuration in PFDF (e.g., provision per day according to operator configuration);\nb)\tSelective push of an ASP change in the PFD set (i.e. ASP changes the PFD set while operator configuration defines when to push);\nc)\tSelective push of an ASP change in the PFD set according to ASP request (i.e. ASP indicates to push changes in a PFD set within the time interval indicated by the Allowed Delay as described in TS 23.682 [42]).\nNOTE 2:\tIn all cases listed above, how to protect the PCEF/TDF from overload during the procedure to provision PFDs is up to Stage 3.\nThe SCEF may be configured with a minimum allowed delay based on SLA to authorize the allowed delay provided by the ASP, as defined in TS 23.682 [42].\nWhen the \"pull\" mode is used, at the time a PCC/ADC Rule with an application identifier for which PFDs provisioned by the PFDF are not available is activated or provisioned, the PCEF/TDF requests all PFDs for that application identifier from the PFDF. The PFDs retrieved for an application identifier from the PFDF are cached in the PCEF/TDF with an associated caching timer to control how long the PFDs are valid. When the caching timer elapses, if there are still active PCC/ADC rules that refer to the corresponding application identifier, the PCEF/TDF reloads the PFD(s) from the PFDF. When the PCEF/TDF removes the last PCC/ADC rule that refers to the corresponding application identifier, or when the caching timer expires and no PCC/ADC rule refers to the application identifier, the PCEF/TDF may remove the PFD(s) related with the application identifier.\nNOTE 3:\tIt is assumed that all PCEF(s)/TDF(s) and PFDF(s) in an operator network are configured with the same default caching time value to be applied for all application identifiers.\nWithin one PLMN, \"push\" mode only, \"pull\" mode only, or a combination of \"pull\" and \"push\" mode may be supported if the feature is supported.\nWhen the \"pull\" mode is used, the PFDF may provide to the PCEF/TDF a caching time value per application identifier. The PCEF/TDF receives the caching time value together with the PFD(s) from the PFDF over Gw/Gwn and applies this value for the application identifier instead of the configured default caching time value. In case no caching time value is received from PFDF, the PCEF/TDF uses the configured default caching time value.\nNOTE 4:\tThe configuration of a caching time value per application identifier PFDF is based on the SLA between the operator and the ASP.\nWhen only \"pull\" mode is supported in one PLMN, if the Allowed Delay is shorter than the caching time value stored for this application identifier, or shorter than the default caching time if no application-specific caching time is stored, the PFDF sends a response to SCEF with an indication that the Allowed Delay cannot be met. The PFDF may still store the PFD(s) and if so, indicate this to the SCEF. The PFDF shall also include the caching time value in the response to the SCEF. The SCEF shall forward the indication that the PFDF stored the PFD(s) (if available) and the caching time value to the ASP when informing that the Allowed Delay could not be met.\nIf the PFDs are managed by local O&M procedures, PFD retrieval is not used; otherwise, the PFDs retrieved from PFDF overrides any PFDs pre-configured in the PCEF/TDF. If all PFDs retrieved from the PFDF are removed for an application identifier, the pre-configured PFDs shall be applied again for the application identifier. The PCEF/TDF may differentiate the need for PFD retrieval based on operator configuration in the PCEF/TDF.\nThe AF requests including an application identifier may trigger the activation or provisioning of a PCC/ADC Rule in the PCEF/TDF by the PCRF based on operator policies.",

      "content": "This feature, when activated by the user, prevents downlink traffic and may prevent uplink traffic via 3GPP access except for 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services.\nNOTE 1:\tPreventing uplink packets that don't belong to 3GPP Data Off Exempt Services in PDN GW implies that the exempt uplink packets in the UE have traversed the Serving GW but get dropped in the PDN GW. If this happens, it's not possible to verify accounting information collected at the Serving GW for inter-operator charging. However, the subscriber may not be charged for those packets.\nThe 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services are a set of operator services, defined in TS 22.011 [49], that are the only allowed services in downlink direction when the 3GPP PS Data Off feature has been activated by the user.\nWhen PCRF is deployed, it shall be configured with the list of 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services and the event trigger of 3GPP PS Data Off status change is used to inform the PCRF about every change of the 3GPP PS Data Off status.\nNOTE 2:\tThe PCRF can be configured with a list of 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services per APN. The list of 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services for an APN can also be empty, or can allow for any service within that APN, according to operator policy.\nNOTE 3:\tThe PCRF can be configured with up to two lists of 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services for UEs in HPLMN and for UEs camping in any VPLMNs using mechanism as specified in clause 6.2.1.1.\nNOTE 4:\tFor the PDN connection used for IMS services, the 3GPP Data Off Exempt Services are enforced in the IMS domain as specified TS 23.228 [39]. Policies configured in the PCRF need to ensure that IMS services are allowed when the 3GPP Data Off status of the UE is set to \"activated\", e.g. by treating any service within a well-known IMS APN as 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services.\nWhen the PCRF is informed about the activation of 3GPP PS Data Off, it shall update the PCC rules in such a way that only packets for services belonging to the list of 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services are forwarded while all other packets are discarded.\nNOTE 5:\tIn order for the PCEF to prevent the services that do not belong to the list of 3GPP PS Data Off Exempted Services, if the services are controlled by dynamic PCC rules, the PCRF could modify the PCC rules by setting the gate status to \"closed\" for the downlink and optionally uplink directions in all active dynamic PCC rules or remove those dynamic PCC rules. If the services are controlled by predefined PCC rules, the PCRF can deactivate those predefined PCC rules. PCC rule with wild-carded service data flow filters can be among the PCC rules that are modified, removed or deactivated in that manner. In this case, it can be necessary that the PCRF at the same time installs or activates PCC rules for data-off exempt services.\nNOTE 6:\tFor example, four PCC rules (A, B, C, D) are active for a PDN connection with PCC rule A representing a 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Service. When 3GPP PS Data Off is activated, the PCRF could either modify PCC rules B, C and D if they are dynamic PCC rules by closing the gate in downlink and optionally in uplink direction or remove/deactivate PCC rules B, C and D if they are predefined PCC rules. PCC rule A does not need to be changed as it represents 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Service. Assuming that PCC rule B contained wild-carded service data flow filters which has enabled some 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Service is removed or deactivated, an additional PCC rule E can be installed or activated as well to enable the downlink traffic for that 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Service.\nNOTE 7:\tThe network configuration can ensure that at least one PCC Rule is bound to the default bearer when Data Off is activated in order to avoid deletion of an existing PDN connection or in order not to fail a PDN connection establishment.\nWhen the PCRF receives service information from the AF, in addition to what is specified in clause 6.2.1.0, PCRF shall check if the requested service information belongs to the 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services. If the requested service belongs to 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services, PCRF shall continue as specified in clause 6.2.1.0. If the requested service doesn't belong to the 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services, PCRF shall reject the service request.\nWhen the PCRF is informed about the deactivation of 3GPP PS Data Off, it shall perform policy control decision as specified in clause 6.2.1.0 and perform PCC rule operations as specified in clause 6.3.2 2 to make sure that the services are allowed according to user's subscription and operator policy (irrespective of whether they belong to the list of 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services).\nWhen PCRF is not deployed, predefined PCC rules, as example, can be configured in the PCEF to ensure the following:\n-\twhen the PCEF is informed about activation of 3GPP PS Data Off, only packets for services belonging to the list of 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services are forwarded while all other packets are discarded. The list of 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services for UEs camping in HPLMN and the list of 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services for UEs camping in VPLMN can be different, and\n-\tWhen PCEF is informed about deactivation of 3GPP PS Data Off, downlink packets are forwarded according to the operator policy for the subscriber.\nNOTE 8:\tFor example, the PCEF can be configured with three sets of predefined PCC rules: one set for UEs with 3GPP PS Data Off status \"inactive\", the second set for UE camping in the HPLMN with 3GPP PS Data Off status \"active\", and the third set for UEs camping in the VPLMN with 3GPP PS Data Off status \"active\". The set of predefined PCC rules for UE 3GPP PS Data Off status \"active\" can be equivalent to the set of predefined PCC rules for UE 3GPP PS Data Off status \"inactive\" with the following two differences: All services belonging to the list of 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services can be represented by PCC rule(s) which allows the traffic to pass while in all other PCC rules (not belonging to the list of 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services) the gate status can be \"closed\" for the downlink direction. When the PCEF is informed about the change of UE 3GPP PS Data Off status, it can replace the currently active set of predefined PCC rules with the other set of predefined PCC rules.\nWhen the UE 3GPP PS Data Off status is \"active\" and a handover from one access-system to another occurs, the PCRF performs the above operations so that the downlink traffic for services not belonging to the list of 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services is only prevented via the 3GPP access.\nWhen NBIFOM applies for the IP-CAN session, the PCRF shall not modify PCC rules associated to the IP-CAN type \"Non 3GPP EPS\".",

      "content": "The PCRF encompasses policy control decision and flow based charging control functionalities.\nThe PCRF provides network control regarding the service data flow detection, gating, QoS and flow based charging (except credit management) towards the PCEF and/or TDF.\nThe PCRF provides network control regarding the application detection, gating, QoS and application based charging (except credit management) towards the TDF and the PCEF enhanced with ADC.\nThe PCRF shall apply the security procedures, as required by the operator, before accepting service information from the AF.\nThe PCRF shall decide whether application traffic detection is applicable, as per operator policies, based on user profile configuration, received within subscription information.\nThe PCRF shall decide how certain service/application traffic shall be treated in the PCEF and in the TDF, if applicable, and ensure that the PCEF user plane traffic mapping and treatment is in accordance with the user's subscription profile.\nIf Gxx applies, the PCRF shall provide QoS rules with identical service data flow templates as provided to the PCEF in the PCC rules. If the service data flow is tunnelled at the BBERF, the PCRF shall provide the BBERF with information received from the PCEF to enable the service data flow detection in the mobility tunnel at the BBERF. In case 2a, defined in clause 7.1, the PCRF may also provide to the BBERF the charging ID information received from the PCEF. If IP flow mobility as specified in TS 23.261 [23] applies, the PCRF shall, based on IP flow mobility routing rules received from the PCEF, provide the authorized QoS rules to the applicable BBERF as specified in clause 6.1.1.3.\nThe PCRF should for an IP‑CAN session derive, from IP‑CAN specific restrictions, operator policy and SPR data, the list of permitted QoS class identifiers and associated GBR and MBR limits for the IP‑CAN session.\nThe PCRF may check that the service information provided by the AF is consistent with both the operator defined policy rules and the related subscription information as received from the SPR during IP‑CAN session establishment before storing the service information. The service information shall be used to derive the QoS for the service. The PCRF may reject the request received from the AF when the service information is not consistent with either the related subscription information or the operator defined policy rules and as a result the PCRF shall indicate that this service information is not covered by the subscription information or by operator defined policy rules and may indicate, in the response to the AF, the service information that can be accepted by the PCRF (e.g. the acceptable bandwidth). In the absence of other policy control mechanisms outside the scope of PCC, it is recommended that the PCRF include this information in the response.\nWhen receiving service information from the AF, the PCRF may temporarily reject the AF request (e.g. if the service information is not consistent with the operator defined policy rules for the congestion status of the user). To temporarily reject the AF request the PCRF shall indicate a re-try interval to the AF. When receiving a re-try interval from the PCRF the AF shall not send the same service information to the PCRF again (for the same IP‑CAN session) until the re-try interval has elapsed.\nNOTE 1:\tHow the PCRF derives the re-try interval is up to implementation.\nIn this Release, the PCRF supports only a single Rx reference point, i.e. there is one AF for each AF session.\nThe PCRF authorizes QoS resources. The PCRF uses the service information received from the AF (e.g. SDP information or other available application information) and/or the subscription information received from the SPR to calculate the proper QoS authorization (QoS class identifier, bitrates). The PCRF may also take into account the requested QoS received from the PCEF via Gx interface.\nNOTE 2:\tThe PCRF provides always the maximum values for the authorized QoS even if the requested QoS is lower than what can be authorized.\nThe Authorization of QoS resources shall be based on complete service information unless the PCRF is required to perform the authorization of QoS resources based on incomplete service information. The PCRF shall after receiving the complete service information, update the affected PCC rules accordingly.\nThe PCRF may use the subscription information as basis for the policy and charging control decisions. The subscription information may apply for both session based and non-session based services.\nThe PCRF determines whether a Gx session from the PCEF is to be linked with a Gateway Control Session from the BBERF by matching the IPv4 address and/or IPv6 network prefix and conditionally the UE Identity, PDN Connection ID and PDN ID towards open Gateway Control Sessions. When IP flow mobility as specified in TS 23.261 [23] applies, one Gx session may be linked with multiple Gateway Control Sessions.\nIf the BBERF does not provide any PDN ID at the Gateway Control Session Establishment, then the PCRF maintains Gateway Control Session to Gx session linking to the Gx sessions where the assigned CoA and UE Identity (if available over Gxx) are equal. The PCRF and BBERF shall be capable of separating information for each IP‑CAN session within the common Gateway Control Session.\nIf the BBERF provides a PDN ID at the Gateway Control Session Establishment, then the PCRF maintains Gateway Control Session to Gx session linking where the UE identity and PDN ID are equal. If the BBERF provides a PDN ID at Gateway Control Session establishment, it may also indicate in the Gateway Control Session establishment that the PCRF shall not attempt linking the new Gateway Control Session with an existing Gx session immediately. If the PCRF receives such an indication, it keeps the new Gateway Control Session pending and defers linking until an IP-CAN session establishment or an IP-CAN session modification with matching UE Identity, PDN ID and IP-CAN type arrives via Gx.\nIf the BBERF provides a PDN ID and a PDN Connection ID at the Gateway Control Session establishment, then the PCRF maintains Gateway Control Session to Gx session linking where the UE identity, PDN Connection ID and PDN ID are equal.\nWhen a BBERF establishes multiple Gateway Control Sessions for the same PDN ID and the IP‑CAN type changes, the PCRF assumes that this constitutes inter-system BBERF relocations of existing Gateway Control Sessions. The BBERF may supply UE IPv4 address and/or IPv6 network prefix (if known) that can be used for linking the new Gateway Control Session to the existing Gx session. If the UE IPv4 address and/or IPv6 network prefix is/are not provided in the new Gateway Control Session establishment, the PCRF shall defer the linking with existing Gx session until receiving an IP-CAN Session modification with matching UE Identity, IP‑CAN type, PDN Connection ID, and PDN ID.\nThe PCRF determines which case applies as described on clause 7.1.\nIf an AF requests the PCRF to report on the signalling path status, for the AF session, the PCRF shall, upon indication of loss of resources from the PCEF, for PCC rules corresponding to the signalling traffic notify the AF on changes to the signalling path status. The PCRF needs to have the knowledge of which PCC rules identify signalling traffic.\nNegotiation of IP‑CAN bearer establishment mode takes place via Gx for 3GPP IP‑CANs. For non-3GPP IP‑CANs specified in TS 23.402 [18] negotiation of bearer establishment mode takes place via Gx when GTP is used and via Gxx for the rest of the cases. For other accesses supporting multiple IP‑CAN bearer establishment modes, if Gxx applies, the negotiation takes place via Gxx, otherwise via Gx. To support the different IP‑CAN bearer establishment modes (UE-only or UE/NW) the PCRF shall:\n-\tshall set the IP‑CAN bearer establishment mode for the IP‑CAN session based on operator configuration, network and UE capabilities;\n-\tshall, if the bearer establishment mode is UE/NW, decide what mode (UE or NW) shall apply for a PCC rule and resolve race conditions between for requests between UE-initiated and NW-initiated requests;\nNOTE 3:\tFor an operator-controlled service, the UE and the PCRF may be provisioned with information indicating which mode is to be used.\n-\tmay reject a UE request that is already served by a NW-initiated procedure in progress. When rejecting a UE-initiated request by sending a reject indication, the PCRF shall use an appropriate cause value which shall be delivered to the UE.\nNOTE 4:\tThis situation may e.g. occur if the PCRF has already triggered a NW-initiated procedure that corresponds to the UE request.\n-\tguarantee the precedence of dynamic PCC rules with SDF template containing SDF filter(s) (and optionally also for SDF templates consisting of an application identifier) for network controlled services in the service data flow detection process at the PCEF by setting the PCC rule precedence information to appropriate values.\nIf an AF requests the PCRF to report on the change of type of IP‑CAN, the PCRF shall provide to the AF the information about the IP‑CAN type the user is currently using and upon indication of change of IP‑CAN type, notify the AF on changes of the type of IP‑CAN. In the case of 3GPP IP‑CAN, the information of the Radio Access Technology Type (e.g. UTRAN) shall be also reported to the AF. If IP flow mobility as specified in TS 23.161 [43] or in TS 23.261 [23] applies, the PCRF shall provide to the AF the new IP-CAN type information together with the affected service information. When IP flow mobility is allowed within an IP‑CAN session, the PCRF shall only report to an AF the IP‑CAN type change when the IP flow mobility applies to the service information provided by this AF.\nNOTE 5:\tThe PCRF can also use the dynamic or pre-defined PCC Rules related to the IMS signalling to request Access Network Information reporting. This can be used to support e.g., regulatory requirements for SMS over IP, where the IMS network (i.e. P‑CSCF) needs to retrieve the user location and/or UE Time Zone information. Note that due to regulatory requirements, the Access Network Information can be requested for SMS over IP, impacting a large number of PDN Connections, that can lead to significant increase in signalling load when the Access Network Information is requested from the Access Node (e.g. MME).\nIf an AF requests the PCRF to report Access Network Information, the PCRF shall set the Access Network Information report parameters in the corresponding PCC rule(s) or QoS rule(s) and provision them together with the corresponding event trigger to the PCEF or BBERF as per procedure in clause 7.4.2. For those PCC rule(s) or QoS rule(s) based on preliminary service information the PCRF may assign the QCI and ARP of the default bearer to avoid signalling to the UE. In addition the SDF filter(s) shall not be marked as to be used for signalling to the UE as traffic mapping information.\nIf an AF requests the PCRF to report Access Network Information, The PCRF shall also set the corresponding event trigger to the PCEF or BBERF as per procedure in clause 7.4.2. The PCRF shall, upon receiving the subsequent Access Network Information report corresponding to the AF session from the PCEF or BBERF, forward the Access Network Information as requested by the AF.\nIf an AF requests the PCRF to report the PLMN identifier where the UE is currently located, then the PCRF shall provide the PLMN identifier to the AF if available.Otherwise, the PCRF shall provision both the corresponding PCC rules and QoS Rules if applicable, and the event trigger to report PLMN change to the PCEF. The PCRF shall, upon receiving of the PLMN identifier from the PCEF forward this information to the AF as defined in the procedures in clause 6.1.4.\nIf an AF requests the PCRF to report Access Network Charging Correlation Information, the PCRF shall provide to the AF the Access Network Charging Correlation Information, which will identify the usage reports that include measurement for the flows, once the Access Network Charging Correlation Information is known at the PCRF. If not known in advance, the PCRF subscribes for the Access Network Charging Correlation Information event for the applicable PCC rule(s), unless a single charging identifier per IP-CAN session is used as described below.\nThe PCEF provides at IP‑CAN session establishment both a charging identifier and an optional indication that the charging identifier is the only one for that IP‑CAN session, as defined in clause 5.1.3 of TS 32.251 [9]. In absence of the indication there is a separate charging identifier for each IP‑CAN bearer to identify usage reports that include measurements for flows served by each individual bearer. When the PCEF indicates that a single charging identifier is used for the IP‑CAN session, the PCRF uses the charging identifier received at IP‑CAN session establishment to provide Access Charging Correlation information to the AF for all flows, instead of subscribing to the Access Network Charging Correlation Information event trigger for the applicable PCC Rule(s) as described above.\nIf Gxx applies and the PCEF provided information about required event triggers, the PCRF shall provide these event triggers to the BBERF and notify the PCEF of the outcome of the provisioning procedure by using the PCRF initiated IP‑CAN Session Modification procedure, as defined in clause 7.4.2. The PCRF shall include the parameter values received in the response from the BBERF in the notification to the PCEF. When multiple BBERFs exist (e.g. in IP flow mobility case), the PCEF may subscribe to different or common set of event triggers at different BBERFs; when the PCRF receives event notification from any BBERF, the PCRF shall include both the parameters values received from the BBERF and also the information for identifying the BBERF in the notification to the PCEF.\nIf Sd applies and the TDF provided information about required event triggers, the PCRF shall provide these event triggers to the PCEF or BBERF, if Gxx applies, and notify the TDF of the outcome of the provisioning procedure within the PCEF initiated IP‑CAN Session Modification procedure, as defined in clause 7.4.1. The PCRF shall include the parameter values, received in the response from the PCEF/BBERF, in the notification to the TDF. The relevant Event Triggers are: PLMN change, Location change, Change in type of IP‑CAN, RAT type change, SGSN change, Serving GW change, User CSG Information change in CSG cell, User CSG Information change in subscribed hybrid cell, User CSG Information change in un-subscribed hybrid cell, Change of UE presence in Presence Reporting Area.\nNOTE 6:\tFor IP flow mobility feature enabled, the TDF doesn't have accurate information about the location and the type of RAT the user is attached to.\nWhen the PCRF gets an event report from the BBERF that is required by the PCEF, the PCRF shall forward this event report to the PCEF.\nWhen the PCRF gets an Event Report from the PCEF/BBERF that is required by the TDF, the PCRF shall forward this Event Report to the TDF.\nThe PCRF may support usage monitoring control. Usage is defined as either volume or time of user plane traffic.\nThe PCRF may receive information about total allowed usage per PDN and UE from the SPR, i.e. the overall amount of allowed resources (based either on traffic volume and/or traffic time) that are to be monitored for the PDN connections of a user. In addition information about total allowed usage for Monitoring key(s) per PDN and UE may also be received from the SPR. For the purpose of usage monitoring per access type , the PCRF receives an individual Monitoring key per access type from SPR.\nFor the purpose of usage monitoring control the PCRF shall request the Usage report trigger and provide the necessary usage threshold(s), either volume threshold, time threshold, or both volume threshold and time threshold, upon which the requested node (PCEF or TDF) shall report to the PCRF. The PCRF shall decide if and when to activate usage monitoring to the PCEF and TDF.\nThe PCRF may provide a Monitoring time to the PCEF/TDF for the Monitoring keys(s) and optionally specify a subsequent threshold value for the usage after the Monitoring time.\nIf the PCEF reports usage before the Monitoring time is reached, the Monitoring time is not retained by the PCEF. Therefore the PCRF may again provide a Monitoring time and optionally the subsequent threshold value for the usage after the Monitoring time in the response.\nIt shall be possible for the PCRF to request a usage report from the requested node (PCEF or TDF).\nNOTE 7:\tThe PCRF ensures that the number of requests/following policy decisions provided over Gx/Sd reference point do not cause excessive signalling load by e.g. assigning the same time for the report only for a preconfigured number of IP-CAN/TDF sessions.\nOnce the PCRF receives a usage report from the requested node (PCEF or TDF) the PCRF shall deduct the value of the usage report from the totally allowed usage for that PDN and UE (in case usage per IP-CAN session is reported). If usage is reported from the TDF or the PCEF, the PCRF shall deduct the value of the usage report from the totally allowed usage for individual Monitoring key(s) for that PDN and UE (in case of usage for one or several Monitoring keys is reported).\nNOTE 8:\tThe PCRF maintains usage thresholds for each Monitoring key and IP‑CAN session that is active for a certain PDN and UE. Updating the total allowanced usage after the PCEF reporting, minimizes the risk of exceeding the usage allowance.\nIf the PCEF or TDF reports usage for a certain Monitoring key and if monitoring shall continue for that Monitoring key then the PCRF shall provide new threshold value(s) in the response to the PCEF or TDF respectively. If Monitoring time and subsequent threshold value are used then the PCRF provides them to the PCEF or TDF as well.\nThe PCRF may provide a new volume threshold and/or a new time threshold to the PCEF or TDF, the new threshold values overrides the existing threshold values in the PCEF or TDF.\nIf monitoring shall no longer continue for that Monitoring key, then the PCRF shall not provide a new threshold in the response to the PCEF / TDF.\nNOTE 9:\tIf the PCRF decides to deactivate all PCC rules or ADC rules associated with a certain Monitoring key, then the conditions defined in clause 6.6.2 for continued Monitoring will no longer be fulfilled for that Monitoring key.\nIf all IP-CAN session of a user to the same APN is terminated, the PCRF shall store the remaining allowed usage, i.e. the information about the remaining overall amount of resources, in the SPR.\nThe PCRF may authorise an application service provider to request specific PCC decisions (e.g. authorisation to request sponsored IP flows, authorisation to request QoS resources). For sponsored data connectivity (see Annex N), the PCRF may receive a usage threshold from the AF.\nIf the AF specifies a usage threshold, the PCRF shall use the Sponsor Identity to construct a Monitoring key for monitoring the volume, time, or both volume and time of user plane traffic, and invoke usage monitoring on the PCEF/TDF. The PCRF shall notify the AF when the PCEF/TDF reports that a usage threshold for the Monitoring key is reached provided that the AF requests to be notified for this event. If the usage threshold is reached, the AF may terminate the AF session or provide a new usage threshold to the PCRF. Alternatively, the AF may allow the session to continue without specifying a usage threshold. If the AF decides to allow the session to continue without specifying a usage threshold, then monitoring in the PCEF/TDF shall be discontinued for that monitoring key by the PCRF, unless there are other reasons for continuing the monitoring.\nIf the AF revokes the service information and the AF has notified previously a usage threshold to the PCRF, the PCRF shall report the usage up to the time of the revocation of service authorization.\nIf the IP-CAN session terminates and the AF has specified a usage threshold then the PCRF shall notify the AF of the accumulated usage (i.e. either volume, or time, or both volume and time) of user plane traffic since the last usage report.\nThe PCRF performs authorizations based on sponsored data connectivity profiles stored in the SPR. If the AF is in the operator's network and is based on the OSA/Parlay-X GW (TS 23.198 [24]), the PCRF is not required to verify that a trust relationship exists between the operator and the sponsors.\nIf the H-PCRF detects that the UE is accessing the sponsored data connectivity in the roaming scenario with home routed access, it may allow the sponsored data connectivity in the service authorization request, reject the service authorization request, or initiate the AF session termination based on home operator policy.\nNOTE 10:\tSponsored data connectivity is not supported in the roaming with visited access scenario in this Release.\nIf the AF request includes an AF application identifier then, based on the operator policies the PCRF may trigger the activation of a predefined PCC/ADC Rule or provide a dynamic PCC/ADC rule with an appropriate application identifier in the PCEF/TDF.\nFor the solicited application reporting, it is PCRF's responsibility to coordinate the PCC rules and QoS rules, if applicable, with ADC rules in order to ensure consistent service delivery.\nThe PCRF uses the information relating to subscriber spending available in the OCS as input for policy decisions related to e.g. QoS control, gating or charging conditions.\nThe PCRF uses the RUCI received from the RCAF as input for policy decisions.\nIf the AF contacts the PCRF via the SCEF (and the Nt interface) to request a time window and related conditions for future background data transfer, the PCRF shall determine possible transfer policies (as described in clause 6.1.16) and send them to the AF together with a reference ID. If the AF received more than one transfer policy, the AF selects one of them and informs the PCRF about the selected transfer policy. The PCRF shall store the selected transfer policy in the SPR together with the reference ID and the network area information. Whenever the PCRF receives a reference ID from the AF during a subsequent transfer of AF session information (via the Rx interface), the PCRF shall retrieve the corresponding transfer policy from the SPR and apply it as one of the inputs for policy decisions for this IP-CAN session.\nThe PCRF uses one or more pieces of information defined in the clause 6.2.1.1 as input for the selection of traffic steering policies used to control the steering of the subscriber's traffic to appropriate (S)Gi-LAN service functions.\nNOTE 11:\tIn order to allow the PCRF to select and provision an application based traffic steering policy, the reporting of detected applications to the PCRF or any other information such as the RAT type, the RUCI etc. defined in clause 6.2.1.1 can be used.\nAt reception of the IMS service information from the P-CSCF, if configured through policy, the PCRF determines the Maximum Packet Loss Rate for UL and DL based on the IMS service information and taking into account information defined in TS 26.114 [45] and sends it to PCEF along with the PCC rule for the voice media.\nNOTE 12:\tBased on local configuration, the PCRF sets the Maximum Packet Loss Rate (UL, DL) corresponding to either the most robust codec configuration (e.g., codec, mode, redundancy) or the least robust codec configuration of the negotiated set in each direction.",

      "content": "The procedures specified in this clause apply when the case of multiple BBFs occurs during handovers. The two BBFs can be located in two separate BBERFs, or one BBF is located in the PCEF and the other one in a BBERF. If the PCRF determines that there is more than one BBF associated with the same IP‑CAN session, the PCRF handles the multiple BBFs as follows:\n-\tThe PCRF classifies the BBERF which reports the same IP‑CAN type as that reported by the PCEF as the primary BBERF and a BBERF that reports an IP‑CAN type different from that reported by the PCEF as non-primary BBERF. If there are more than one BBERFs that report the same IP‑CAN type as that reported by the PCEF, the BBERF that last created the GW Control Session with the PCRF is classified as the primary BBERF and other BBERF(s) are classified as non-primary BBERF(s).\nNOTE 1:\tDuring handover where the BBF moves from a BBERF to the PCEF (e.g. handover from PMIP to GTP), when the PCEF reports a new IP-CAN type, the BBERF is classified as a non-primary BBERF. There is no primary BBERF but the active BBF is in the PCEF.\nNOTE 2:\tDuring handover where the BBF moves from the PCEF to a BBERF (e.g. handover from GTP to PMIP), when the BBERF creates a Gateway Control Session, it is classified as a non-primary BBERF. This BBERF subsequently gets classified as the primary BBERF when the PCEF reports an IP‑CAN type which is the same as that reported by the BBERF.\n-\tWhen a new (primary/non-primary) BBERF supporting NW/UE bearer establishment mode creates a GW Control session, the PCRF provides to the new BBERF QoS rules corresponding to SDFs. For a change of IP‑CAN type, the QoS parameters of some of the QoS rules may be changed or some QoS rules may not be provided to the new BBERF, e.g. depending of the capability of the target RAT. When a new (primary/non-primary) BBERF supporting only UE bearer establishment mode creates a GW Control session, the PCRF authorizes the setup of the default bearer and only pushes down QoS rules in response to specific requests from the BBERF.\nNOTE 3:\tAfter completion of the handover procedure to the new BBERF, the UE can still initiate the access specific procedures to modify or release the resources that were originally allocated based on UE-initiated resource allocation. Such operations and the associated changes to QoS rules are handled following the normal UE-initiated resource management procedures.\nNOTE 4:\tTo facilitate the UE's determination of QoS resources in the target access allocated to pre-existing IP flows the access system is required to provide packet filters with the same content as that in the SDF template filters received over the Gx/Gxx interface (see clause 6.1.9).\n-\tIf the BBF is located in any of the BBERF, the PCRF keeps track of QoS rules activation by all the BBERFs. The PCRF updates PCC rules to the PCEF based on activation status of QoS rules in the primary BBERF.\n-\tIf the primary-BBERF reports failure to activate a QoS rule, the PCRF also removes the same QoS rule from the non-primary BBERFs, if any are already installed, and the corresponding PCC rule from the PCEF. If a non-primary BBERF reports failure to install a QoS rule, the PCRF updates the status for that particular BBERF in its record but does not perform any further action.\n-\tWhen path-switch occurs and the PCEF informs the PCRF of a new IP‑CAN type, if a BBERF is re-classified as a primary BBERF, the PCRF may update QoS rules in the BBERF corresponding to the PCC rules in the PCEF.\n-\tFor the case of UE initiated resource reservation through the non-primary BBERF: If a non-primary BBERF request results in a change of the QoS rules active in the primary-BBERF, e.g. creation of a new QoS rule or results in modification of an existing QoS rule, then the PCRF shall reject the request.",

      "content": "The procedures specified in this clause apply when the case of multiple BBFs occurs during flow mobility scenarios as specified in TS 23.261 [23]. The multiple BBFs can be located in either separate BBERFs, or one BBF is located in the PCEF and the other ones in separate BBERFs. If the PCRF determines that there is more than one BBF associated with the same IP‑CAN session due to flow mobility, the PCRF handles the multiple BBFs as follows:\n-\tThe default route may be associated with one of the BBFs. The PCRF does not differentiate between primary and secondary BBF.\n-\tIf, based on routing information received from the PCEF, the PCRF determines that the bearer binding for a service data flow is located in a BBERF, the PCRF provides QoS rules for bearer binding to the appropriate BBERF/BBF. Each service data flow is associated with one BBF based on the routing information. If no explicit routing information for a service data flow is available from the PCEF, the PCRF provides PCC/QoS rules for the service data flow based on the default route.\n-\tWhen the route of a service data flow changes from one source BBF to another target BBF, the PCRF removes the QoS rules related to the service data flow from the source BBF (if the source BBF is located in a BBERF) and provisions the QoS rules related to the service data flow to the target BBF (if the target BBF is located in a BBERF).\n-\tThe PCRF may select different bearer establishment mode for different BBFs. Provision of PCC/QoS rules to a specific BBF follows the rule provision procedures based on the bearer establishment mode selected for that BBF.",

      "content": "The PCEF encompasses service data flow detection, policy enforcement and flow based charging functionalities.\nThis functional entity is located at the Gateway (e.g. GGSN in the GPRS case, and PDG in the WLAN case). It provides service data flow detection, user plane traffic handling, triggering control plane session management (where the IP‑CAN permits), QoS handling, and service data flow measurement as well as online and offline charging interactions.\nA PCEF shall ensure that an IP packet, which is discarded at the PCEF as a result from PCC rule enforcement or flow based charging, is neither reported for offline charging nor cause credit consumption for online charging.\nNOTE 1:\tFor certain cases e.g. suspected fraud an operator shall be able to block the service data flow but still be able to account for any packets associated with any blocked service data flow.\nThe PCEF is enforcing the Policy Control as indicated by the PCRF in two different ways:\n-\tGate enforcement. The PCEF shall allow a service data flow, which is subject to policy control, to pass through the PCEF if and only if the corresponding gate is open;\n-\tQoS enforcement:\n-\tQoS class identifier correspondence with IP‑CAN specific QoS attributes. The PCEF shall be able to convert a QoS class identifier value to IP‑CAN specific QoS attribute values and determine the QoS class identifier value from a set of IP‑CAN specific QoS attribute values.\n-\tPCC rule QoS enforcement. The PCEF shall enforce the authorized QoS of a service data flow according to the active PCC rule (e.g. to enforce uplink DSCP marking).\n-\tIP‑CAN bearer QoS enforcement. The PCEF controls the QoS that is provided to a combined set of service data flows. The policy enforcement function ensures that the resources which can be used by an authorized set of service data flows are within the \"authorized resources\" specified via the Gx interface by \"authorized QoS\". The authorized QoS provides an upper bound on the resources that can be reserved (GBR) or allocated (MBR) for the IP‑CAN bearer. The authorized QoS information is mapped by the PCEF to IP‑CAN specific QoS attributes. During IP-CAN bearer QoS enforcement, if packet filters are provided to the UE, the PCEF shall provide packet filters with the same content as that in the SDF template filters received over the Gx interface.\nThe PCEF is enforcing the charging control in the following way:\n-\tFor a service data flow (defined by an active PCC rule) that is subject to charging control, the PCEF shall allow the service data flow to pass through the PCEF if and only if there is a corresponding active PCC rule with and, for online charging, the OCS has authorized credit for the charging key. The PCEF may let a service data flow pass through the PCEF during the course of the credit re-authorization procedure.\nFor a service data flow (defined by an active PCC rule) that is subject to both Policy Control and Charging Control, the PCEF shall allow the service data flow to pass through the PCEF if and only if the right conditions from both policy control and charging control happen. I.e. the corresponding gate is open and in case of online charging the OCS has authorized credit for its charging key.\nFor a service data flow (defined by an active PCC rule) that is subject to policy control only and not charging control, the PCEF shall allow the service data flow to pass through the PCEF if and only if the conditions for policy control are met.\nA PCEF may be served by one or more PCRF nodes. The PCEF shall contact the appropriate PCRF based on the packet data network (PDN) connected to, together with, a UE identity information (if available, and which may be IP‑CAN specific). It shall be possible to ensure that the same PCRF is contacted for a specific UE irrespective of the IP‑CAN used.\nThe operator may configure an indicator in HSS which is delivered to the PCEF within the Charging Characteristics and used by the PCEF to not establish the Gx session during the IP-CAN session establishment procedure.\nNOTE 2:\tThe decision to not establish the Gx session applies for the life time of the IP-CAN session.\nNOTE 3:\tThe indicator in the HSS is operator specific, therefore its value is understood within the HPLMN and can be used in both non-roaming or home routed roaming cases.\nThe PCEF shall, on request from the PCRF, modify a PCC rule, using the equivalent PCEF behaviour as the removal of the old and the activation of the new (modified) PCC rule. The PCEF shall modify a PCC rule as an atomic operation. The PCEF shall not modify a predefined PCC rule on request from the PCRF.\nThe PCEF should support predefined PCC rules.\nFor online charging, the PCEF shall manage credit as defined in clause 6.1.3.\nThe operator may apply different PCC rules depending on different PLMN. The PCEF shall be able to provide identifier of serving network to the PCRF, which may be used by the PCRF in order to select the PCC rule to be applied.\nThe operator may configure whether Policy and Charging Control is to be applied based on different access point.\nThe PCEF shall gather and report IP‑CAN bearer usage information according to clause 6.1.2. The PCEF may have a pre-configured Default charging method. Upon the initial interaction with the PCRF, the PCEF shall provide pre-configured Default charging method if available.\nAt IP‑CAN session establishment the PCEF shall initiate the IP‑CAN Session Establishment procedure, as defined in clause 7.2. In case the SDF is tunnelled at the BBERF, the PCEF shall inform the PCRF about the mobility protocol tunnelling header of the service data flows. In case 2a, defined in clause 7.1, the PCEF may provide charging ID information to the PCRF. The PCEF shall inform the PCRF on whether it is enhanced with ADC, or provide the TDF address, if one is configured at the PCEF. If no PCC rule was activated for the IP‑CAN session, the PCEF shall reject the IP‑CAN session establishment.\nIf there is no PCC rule active for a successfully established IP‑CAN session at any later point in time, e.g., through a PCRF initiated IP‑CAN session modification, the PCEF shall initiate an IP‑CAN session termination procedure, as defined in clause 7.3.2. If the PCRF terminates the Gx session, the PCEF shall initiate an IP‑CAN session termination procedure, as defined in clause 7.3.2.\nIf there is no PCC rule active for a successfully established IP‑CAN bearer at any later point in time, e.g., through a PCRF initiated IP‑CAN session modification, the PCEF shall initiate an IP‑CAN bearer termination procedure, as defined in clause 7.4.1.\nIf the IP‑CAN session is modified, e.g. by changing the characteristics for an IP‑CAN bearer, the PCEF shall first use the event trigger to determine whether to request the PCC rules for the modified IP‑CAN session from the PCRF; afterwards, the PCEF shall use the re-authorisation triggers, if available, in order to determine whether to require re-authorisation for the PCC rules that were either unaffected or modified. If the PCEF receives an unsolicited update of the PCC rules from the PCRF (IP‑CAN session modification, clause 7.4.2), the PCC rules shall be activated, modified or removed as indicated by the PCRF.\nThe PCEF shall inform the PCRF about the outcome of a PCC rule operation. If network initiated procedures apply to the PCC rule and the corresponding IP‑CAN bearer can not be established or modified to satisfy the bearer binding, then the PCEF shall reject the activation of a PCC rule.\nThe PCEF shall inform the PCRF about any removal of a PCC rule, that the PCRF has activated, that occurs without explicit instruction from the PCRF.\nWhen IP-CAN bearer resources are released, i.e. at IP-CAN session termination or PCEF-initiated IP-CAN session modification notifying that PCC Rules are removed, the PCEF shall also provide, if available, the reason why resources are released, i.e. RAN/NAS Release Cause, TWAN Release Cause or UWAN Release Cause.\nNOTE 4:\tIn case of a rejection of a PCC rule activation the PCRF may e.g. modify the attempted PCC rule, de-activate or modify other PCC rules and retry activation or abort the activation attempt and, if applicable, inform the AF that transmission resources are not available.\nIf network initiated procedures for IP‑CAN bearer establishment apply this also includes provisioning the UE with traffic mapping information. See clause 6.1.9, Annex A and Annex D for details.\nIf another IP‑CAN session is established by the same user, this is treated independently from the existing IP‑CAN session.\nTo support the different IP‑CAN bearer establishment modes (UE-only or UE/NW) the PCEF shall:\n-\tforward the network and UE capabilities to the PCRF;\n-\tapply the IP‑CAN bearer establishment mode for the IP‑CAN session set by the PCRF.\nDuring an IP‑CAN session modification, the PCEF shall provide information (belonging to the IP‑CAN bearer established or modified) to the PCRF as follows:\n-\tin UE-only bearer establishment mode, the PCEF shall send the full QoS and traffic mapping information;\n-\tin UE/NW bearer establishment mode, the PCEF shall:\n-\tat UE-initiated bearer establishment, send the full QoS and traffic mapping information;\n-\tat UE-initiated bearer modification, send information on the requested change to QoS bitrates and changes to the traffic mapping information;\n-\tat NW-initiated bearer establishment or modification, the PCEF shall not send any QoS or traffic mapping information.\nWhen flow mobility as specified in TS 23.261 [23] applies, the PCEF shall provide IP flow mobility routing information to the PCRF as follows:\n-\tthe default route to be used if no explicit routing information for a service data flow is provided;\n-\tthe route for an IP flow.\nThe PCEF shall derive the routing information from the IP flow mobility flow bindings installed in the PCEF, as defined in TS 23.261 [23].\nIf there are events which can not be monitored in the PCEF, the PCEF shall provide the information about the required event triggers to the PCRF using the PCEF initiated IP‑CAN Session Modification procedure, as defined in clause 7.4.1, or in the response to a PCRF initiated IP‑CAN Session Modification, as defined in clause 7.4.3. If the triggers were provided by the OCS at credit authorization, it is an implementation option whether a successful confirmation is required from the PCRF in order for the PCEF to consider the credit (re-)authorization procedure to be successful.\nIP‑CAN-specific parameters may be sent by the PCRF to the PCEF or the PCEF to the PCRF. The IP‑CAN Session Modification procedure may be used to deliver these parameters to allow interaction between the BBERF and the PCEF by way of the PCRF. This is required in accesses that require these parameters to be sent indirectly.\nThe PCEF shall support usage monitoring as specified in clause 4.4.\nThe PCEF enhanced with ADC shall handle application traffic detection as per request from PCRF as well as report about the detected application traffic along with service data flow descriptions, if deducible, to the PCRF, if requested by the PCRF.\nThe PCEF shall support traffic steering as specified in clause 6.1.17.\nThe PCEF shall support 3GPP PS Data Off as specified in clause 6.1.21.\nThe PCEF forwards the Maximum Packet Loss Rate for UL and DL, if received from PCRF for the PCC rule bound to a QCI=1 bearer. In the case multiple PCC Rules share one QCI=1 bearer and the PCEF received multiple Maximum Packet Loss Rates, the PCEF chooses the lowest value per direction related to these PCC rules.\nWhen the PCRF provides updated PCC rules for the IP-CAN session to the PCEF, and the PCC rules were not enforced due to that the UE is in suspend state, e.g. due to SRVCC to GERAN without DTM support as specified in clause 6.2.2.1 in the TS 23.216 [28] or CSFB to UTRAN without PS Handover as specified in clause 6.5 in the TS 23.272 [52], the PCEF shall indicate to the PCRF that the PCC Rules were not enforced with the reason that the UE is in suspend state. Upon reception of the failure indication, the PCRF may subscribe to UE resumed from suspend state event trigger.",

      "content": "This clause refers to the detection process that identifies the packets belonging to a service data flow. Each PCC rule contains a service data flow template, which defines the data for the service data flow detection as a set of service data flow filters or an application identifier referring to an application detection filter.\nFor PCC rules that contain an application identifier (i.e. that refer to an application detection filter), the order and the details of the detection are implementation specific. The application detection filter may be extended with the PFDs provided by the PFDF as described in clause 6.1.20. The new PFDs provided by the PFDF replace the existing ones in the PCEF. When multiple PFDs are associated with application identifier, the application is detected when any of the PFDs associated with the application identifier is matched. In addition, if a PFD contains multiple attributes, the PFD is only matched when every attribute contained in the PFD has a matching value.\nOnce an application has been detected, enforcement and charging shall however be applied under consideration of the PCC rule precedence, i.e. when multiple PCC rules overlap, only the enforcement and charging actions of the PCC rule with the highest precedence shall be applied.\nFor PCC Rules that contain an application identifier (i.e. that refer to an application detection filter) the detection of the uplink part of the service data flow may be active in parallel on other bearers with non-GBR QCI (e.g. the default bearer) in addition to the bearer where the PCC rule is bound to.\nNOTE 1:\tWhen PCC rules with application detection filters cannot be used to generate traffic mapping information for the UE, the application detection may need to inspect traffic on multiple bearers. The PCEF uses implementation specific logic to determine for what bearers the up-link service data flow detection applies. The uplink traffic will get the QoS of the bearer carrying the traffic. The QCI of the bearer may therefore be different than the QCI of the PCC rule detecting the service data flow. The charging and other enforcement functions performed by the PCEF will still be carried out based on parameters of the PCC rule detecting the service data flow. If the PCC rule contains a GBR QCI, the GBR resource reservation will only apply on the bearer where the PCC rule is bound to. The PCRF can prevent that uplink GBR resources are reserved by providing an uplink GBR value of zero in the PCC rule.\nThe PCEF shall discard a packet in the case that there is no service data flow template of the same direction (i.e. of the IP‑CAN session for the downlink or of the IP‑CAN bearer for the uplink) detecting the packet.\nNOTE 2:\tFor the uplink direction, discarding packets due to no matching service data flow template is also referred to as uplink bearer binding verification. For the case a BBERF is present, uplink bearer binding verification is done by the BBERF.\nNOTE 3:\tIf PCC Rule containing an Application Identifier inspects traffic on multiple bearers in the uplink, such detected traffic counts as detection by that PCC rule.\nThe remainder of this clause describes the detection of service data flows identified by a service data flow filter (i.e. does not apply to PCC rules containing an application identifier):\n-\tEach service data flow template may contain any number of service data flow filters;\n-\tEach service data flow filter is applicable uplink, downlink or both uplink and downlink;\n-\tService data flow filters are applied for each direction, so that the detection is applied independently for the downlink and uplink directions;\nNOTE 4:\tService data flow filters that apply in both uplink and downlink should be used whenever the underlying IP‑CAN and access type supports this.\nNOTE 5:\tA service data flow template may include service data flow filters for one direction, or for both directions.\n-\tEach service data flow filter may contain information about whether the explicit signalling of the corresponding traffic mapping information to the UE is required.\nNOTE 6:\tThis information enables e.g. the generation/removal of traffic mapping information for a default IP‑CAN bearer as well as the usage of PCC rules with specific service data flow filters on a default IP‑CAN bearer without the need to generate traffic mapping information.\nFigure 6.3: Relationship of service data flow, packet flow, service data flow template and service data flow filter\nService data flow filters identifying the service data flow may:\n-\tbe a pattern for matching the IP 5 tuple (source IP address or IPv6 network prefix, destination IP address or IPv6 network prefix, source port number, destination port number, protocol ID of the protocol above IP). In the pattern:\n-\ta value left unspecified in a filter matches any value of the corresponding information in a packet;\n-\tan IP address may be combined with a prefix mask;\n-\tport numbers may be specified as port ranges.\n-\tthe pattern can be extended by the Type of Service (TOS) (IPv4) / Traffic class (IPv6) and Mask;\n-\tconsist of the destination IP address and optional mask, protocol ID of the protocol above IP, the Type of Service (TOS) (IPv4) / Traffic class (IPv6) and Mask and the IPSec Security Parameter Index (SPI);\n-\tconsist of the destination IP address and optional mask, the Type of Service (TOS) (IPv4) / Traffic class (IPv6) and Mask and the Flow Label (IPv6).\nNOTE 7:\tThe details about the IPSec Security Parameter Index (SPI), the Type of Service (TOS) (IPv4) / Traffic class (IPv6) and Mask and the Flow Label (IPv6) are defined in clause 15.3 of TS 23.060 [12].\n-\textend the packet inspection beyond the possibilities described above and look further into the packet and/or define other operations (e.g. maintaining state). Such service data flow filters must be predefined in the PCEF.\nNOTE 8:\tSuch filters may be used to support filtering with respect to a service data flow based on the transport and application protocols used above IP. This shall be possible for HTTP and WAP. This includes the ability to differentiate between TCP, Wireless-TCP according to WAP 2.0, WDP, etc, in addition to differentiation at the application level. Filtering for further application protocols and services may also be supported.\nFor downlink traffic, the downlink parts of all the service data flow templates associated with the IP‑CAN session for the destination address are candidates for matching in the detection process.\nFigure 6.4: The service data flow template role in detecting the downlink part of a service data flow and mapping to IP‑CAN bearers\nFor uplink traffic, the uplink parts of all the service data flow templates associated with the IP‑CAN bearer (details according to clause A), are candidates for matching in the detection process.\nFigure 6.5: The service data flow template role in detecting the uplink part of a service data flow\nNOTE 9:\tTo avoid the PCEF discarding packets due to no matching service data flow template, the operator may apply open PCC rules (with wild-carded service data flow filters) to allow for the passage of packets that do not match any other candidate service data flow template.\nService data flow templates shall be applied in the order of their precedence.",

The Measurement method indicates what measurement type is applicable to the PCC rule.\nNOTE 1:\tEvent based charging is only applicable to predefined PCC rules and PCC rules using an application detection filter (i.e. with an application identifier).\nThe PCEF measurement measures all the user plane traffic, except traffic that PCC causes to be discarded.\nThe PCEF shall maintain a measurement per IP‑CAN bearer (IP‑CAN specific details according to Annex A and Annex D), and Charging Key combination.\nIf Service identifier level reporting is mandated in a PCC rule, the PCEF shall maintain a measurement for that Charging Key and Service Identifier combination, for the IP‑CAN bearer (IP‑CAN specific details according to Annex A and Annex D).\nNOTE 2:\tIn addition, the GW may maintain IP‑CAN bearer level measurement if required by the operator.\nFor usage monitoring, the PCEF shall support volume and time measurement for an IP-CAN session and maintain a measurement for each IP-CAN session for which the PCRF has requested the Usage report trigger and provided threshold values on an IP‑CAN session level. The PCEF shall be able to support volume and time measurements simultaneously for a given IP-CAN session.\nThe PCEF shall support volume and time measurement per Monitoring key and maintain a measurement for each Monitoring key if the PCRF has requested the Usage report trigger and provided threshold values on Monitoring key level. The PCEF shall be able to support volume and time measurements simultaneously for a given Monitoring Key.\nThe PCEF shall support simultaneous volume and time measurement for usage monitoring on IP‑CAN session level and Monitoring key level for the same IP‑CAN session.\nVolume and time measurements for usage monitoring purposes on IP‑CAN session level and on Monitoring key level shall be performed independently of each other. If the PCC rule is associated with an indication of exclusion from session level monitoring, the PCEF shall not consider the corresponding service data flow for the volume and time measurement on IP-CAN session level.\nIf the Usage report reached event trigger is set and a volume or a time threshold is reached, the PCEF shall report this event to the PCRF. The PCEF shall continue to perform volume or time measurement after the threshold is reached and before a new threshold is provided by the PCRF. At IP-CAN session termination or if the conditions defined in clause 6.6.2 for continued monitoring are no longer met, or if the PCRF explicitly requests a usage report, the PCEF shall inform the PCRF about the resources that have been consumed by the user since the last usage report for the affected Monitoring keys, including the resources consumed before and after the Monitoring time was reached, if provided according to clause 6.2.1.0.\nIf combined volume and time measurements are requested by the PCRF, then the reporting shall be done for both together. For example, if the volume threshold is reached, the consumed time shall be reported as well and, in order to continue combined volume and time measurements, the PCRF shall provide a new time threshold along with a new volume threshold. The PCEF shall continue to perform volume and time measurement after the threshold is reached and before a new threshold is provided by the PCRF. If new threshold is provided only for time or volume, then the measurements shall continue only for that provided type and the accumulated usage for the non provided type shall be discarded by the PCEF.\nWhen the PCRF requests to report usage, the PCEF shall report the accumulated usage to the PCRF according to the provided usage threshold, i.e. the PCEF reports accumulated volume when the volume threshold was provided by the PCRF, accumulated time when the time threshold was provided by the PCRF and both accumulated volume and accumulated time when volume threshold and time threshold were provided by the PCRF.\nIf the Usage thresholds for a Monitoring key are not provided to the PCEF in the acknowledgement of an IP-CAN Session modification where its usage was reported, then the usage monitoring shall not continue in the PCEF for that Monitoring key.\nWhen the Monitoring time occurs, the accumulated volume and/or time usage shall be recorded by the PCEF and:\n-\tIf the subsequent usage threshold value is provided, the usage threshold shall be reset to this value by the PCEF.\n-\tOtherwise, the usage threshold shall be set by the PCEF to the remaining value of the threshold previously sent by the PCRF (i.e. excluding the accumulated usage).\nThe first usage report after the Monitoring Time was reached shall indicate the usage up to the Monitoring time and usage after the Monitoring time.\nIn order to support time based usage monitoring, the PCRF may optionally indicate to the PCEF, along with other usage monitoring information provided, the Inactivity Detection Time. This value represents the time interval after which the time measurement shall stop for the Monitoring key, if no packets are received belonging to the corresponding Monitoring Key during that time period. Time measurement shall resume on receipt of a further packet belonging to the Monitoring key.\nTime measurement for a Monitoring key shall also be stopped when time based usage monitoring is disabled, if this happens before the Inactivity Detection Time is reached.\nIf an Inactivity Detection Time value of zero is provided, or if no Inactivity Detection Time is present within the usage monitoring information provided by the PCRF, the time measurement shall be performed continuously from the point at which it was started until time based usage monitoring is disabled.",

The MBR (per PCC rule / per bearer) is used for rate policing.\nFor a UE-initiated IP‑CAN bearer establishment or modification the PCEF receives the authorized QoS (QCI, ARP, GBR, MBR) for a bearer that the PCEF has identified for the PCRF. The PCEF shall enforce it which may lead to a downgrading or upgrading of the requested bearer QoS.\nNOTE 1:\tThe MBR is an average value, which is measured over some time period. Services may generate media with variable bitrate. For example, TS 26.114 [45] describes the bitrate variations that may be generated for real-time conversational media in the MTSI service. The policing function in the PCEF should take such bitrate variations into account.\nFor a network initiated IP‑CAN bearer establishment or modification the PCEF receives the authorized QoS per PCC rule (QCI, ARP, GBR, MBR). For GBR bearers the PCEF should set the bearer's GBR to the sum of the GBRs of all PCC rules that are active and bound to that GBR bearer. If a set of PCC Rules is subject to resource sharing as specified in clause 6.1.14 the PCEF should use, for each applicable direction, the highest GBR from the set of PCC Rules sharing resources as input for calculating the bearer´s GBR. For GBR bearers the PCEF should set the bearer's MBR to the sum of the MBRs of all PCC rules that are active and bound to that GBR bearer. If a set of PCC Rules is subject to resource sharing as specified in clause 6.1.14 the PCEF may, for each applicable direction, use the highest MBR from the set of PCC Rules as input for calculating the bearer´s MBR.\nNOTE 2:\tSince the PCRF controls the GBR value in the PCC rule, the PCRF can prevent that uplink GBR resources are reserved by providing an uplink GBR value of zero for that PCC rule, This may be useful e.g. for a PCC rule with application identifier as the uplink traffic can be received in other bearers than the one the PCC rule is bound to.\nFor an IP‑CAN that supports non-GBR bearers that have a separate MBR (e.g. GPRS) the PCEF may, before or in connection with activation of the first PCC rule with a certain QCI, receive the authorized QoS (QCI, MBR) for that QCI. The authorized MBR per QCI only applies to non-GBR bearers, and it sets an upper limit for the MBR that the PCEF assigns to a non-GBR bearer with that QCI. In case multiple IP‑CAN bearers within the same IP‑CAN session are assigned the same QCI, the authorized MBR per QCI applies independently to each of those IP‑CAN bearers. The PCRF may change the authorized MBR per QCI at any time. An authorized GBR per QCI shall not be signalled on Gx.\nNOTE 3:\tThe intention of the authorized MBR per QCI is to avoid frequent IP‑CAN bearer modifications as PCC rules are dynamically activated and deactivated. That is, the PCEF may choose to assign the authorized MBR per QCI to a non-GBR bearer with that QCI.",

The AF shall communicate with the PCRF to transfer dynamic session information, required for PCRF decisions as well as to receive IP‑CAN specific information and notifications about IP‑CAN bearer level events. One example of an AF is the P‑CSCF of the IM CN subsystem.\nThe AF may receive an indication that the service information is not accepted by the PCRF together with service information that the PCRF would accept. In that case, the AF rejects the service establishment towards the UE. If possible the AF forwards the service information to the UE that the PCRF would accept.\nAn AF may communicate with multiple PCRFs. The AF shall contact the appropriate PCRF based on either:\n-\tthe end user IP Address; and/or\n-\ta UE identity that the AF is aware of.\nNOTE 1:\tBy using the end user IP address, an AF is not required to acquire any UE identity in order to provide information, for a specific user, to the PCRF.\nIn case of private IP address being used for the end user, the AF may send additional PDN information (e.g. PDN ID) over the Rx interface. This PDN information is used by the PCRF for session binding, and it is also used to help selecting the correct PCRF.\nFor certain events related to policy control, the AF shall be able to give instructions to the PCRF to act on its own, i.e. based on the service information currently available as described in clause 6.1.5.\nThe AF may use the IP‑CAN bearer level information in the AF session signalling or to adjust the IP‑CAN bearer level event reporting.\nThe AF may request the PCRF to report on IP‑CAN bearer level events (e.g. the signalling path status for the AF session). The AF shall cancel the request when the AF ceases handling the user.\nNOTE 2:\tThe QoS authorization based on incomplete service information is required for e.g. IMS session setup scenarios with available resources on originating side and a need for resource reservation on terminating side.\nThe AF may request the PCRF to report on the change of type of IP‑CAN. The PCRF shall report the IP-CAN type and subsequent changes to the AF together with the information of the Radio Access Technology Type (e.g. UTRAN) as defined in access specific annexes. The change of the Radio Access Technology Type (e.g. UTRAN) shall be also reported to the AF, even if the IP‑CAN type is unchanged.\nThe AF may request the PCRF to report any combination of the user location and/or UE Timezone at AF session establishment, modification or termination. For AF session termination the communication between the AF and the PCRF shall be kept alive until the PCRF report is received.\nThe AF may request the PCRF to report changes of the PLMN identifier where the UE is currently located at AF session establishment. The PLMN identifier reporting remains until the AF session is terminated.\nIf IP-CAN bearer resources corresponding to the AF session are released, the PCRF reports to the AF, if available, the reason why IP-CAN bearer resources are released i.e. RAN/NAS Release Cause, TWAN Release Cause or UWAN Release Cause.\nIf IP-CAN bearer resources corresponding to the AF session are released, the PCRF reports to the AF, if available, the User Location Information and/or the UE Timezone.\nNOTE 3:\tThe H-PCRF informs the AF of event triggers that cannot be reported. For detail see Annex L.\nTo support sponsored data connectivity (see Annex N), the AF may provide the PCRF with the sponsored data connectivity information, including optionally a usage threshold, as specified in clause 5.2.1. The AF may request the PCRF to report events related to sponsored data connectivity.\nIf the user plane traffic traverses the AF, the AF may handle the usage monitoring and therefore it is not required to provide a usage threshold to the PCRF as part of the sponsored data connectivity information.\nIn order to mitigate RAN user plane congestion, the Rx reference point enables transport of the following information from the PCRF to the AF:\n-\tRe-try interval, which indicates when service delivery may be retried on Rx.\nNOTE 4:\tAdditionally, existing bandwidth limitation parameters on Rx interface during the Rx session establishment are available in order to mitigate RAN user plane congestion.\nWhen receiving service information from the AF, the PCRF may temporarily reject the AF request (e.g. if the service information is not consistent with the operator defined policy rules for the congestion status of the user). To temporarily reject the AF request the PCRF shall indicate a re-try interval to the AF. When receiving a re-try interval from the PCRF the AF shall not send the same service information to the PCRF again (for the same IP‑CAN session) until the re-try interval has elapsed.\nThe AF may contact the PCRF via the SCEF (and the Nt interface) to request a time window and related conditions for future background data transfer (as described in clause 6.1.16). If the PCRF replies with more than one transfer policy, the AF shall select one of them and inform the PCRF about the selected transfer policy. The reference ID provided by the PCRF shall be used by the AF during every subsequent transfer of AF session information related to this background data transfer (via the Rx interface).",

The value range is expandable to accommodate additional types of IP‑CAN.\nNOTE 2:\tThe QoS class identifier is mandatory when the bearer binding is allocated to the PCEF.\nNOTE 3:\tMandatory when the QoS class identifier is of Resource Type GBR. Used to activate policy control on SDF level at the PCEF.\nNOTE 4:\tMandatory if there is no default charging method for the IP‑CAN session.\nNOTE 5:\tMandatory when policy control on SDF level applies unless otherwise stated in an access-specific Annex.\nNOTE 6:\tApplicable to sponsored data connectivity.\nNOTE 7:\tEither service data flow filter(s) or application identifier shall be defined per each rule. application identifier can only be used for PCEF enhanced with ADC.\nNOTE 8:\tOptional and applicable only if application identifier exists within the rule.\nNOTE 9:\tFor PCC rules based on an application detection filter, the precedence is only relevant for the enforcement, i.e. when multiple PCC rules overlap, only the enforcement, reporting of application starts and stops, monitoring, and charging actions of the PCC rule with the highest precedence shall be applied.\nNOTE 10:\tOptional and applicable only if application identifier exists within the rule.\nNOTE 11:\tIf Redirect is enabled.\nNOTE 12:\tYES, in case the service data flow template consists of a set of service data flow filters. NO in case the service data flow template consists of an application identifier.\nNOTE 13:\tThe Precedence is mandatory for PCC rules with SDF template containing SDF filter(s). For dynamic PCC rules with SDF template containing an application identifier, the precedence is either preconfigured in PCEF or provided in the PCC rule from PCRF.\nNOTE 14:\tThe Traffic steering policy identifier can be different for uplink and downlink direction. If two Traffic steering policy identifiers are provided, then one is for uplink direction, while the other one is for downlink direction.\nNOTE 15:\tThe presence of this attribute causes the QCI/ARP of the rule to be ignored. This attribute is defined for selected accesses as specified in the access specific Annexes.\nNOTE 16:\tOptional and applicable only for voice service data flow in this Release.\nThe Rule identifier shall be unique for a PCC rule within an IP‑CAN session. A dynamically provided PCC rule that has the same Rule identifier value as a predefined PCC rule shall replace the predefined rule within the same IP‑CAN session.\nThe Service data flow template may comprise any number of Service data flow filters. A Service data flow filter contains information for matching user plane packets. A Service data flow filter, provided from the PCRF, contains information elements as described in clause 6.2.2.2. The Service data flow template filtering information within an activated PCC rule is applied at the PCEF to identify the packets belonging to a particular service data flow.\nNOTE 3:\tPredefined PCC rules may include service data flow filters, which support extended capabilities, including enhanced capabilities to identify events associated with application protocols.\nAlternatively, the Service data flow template consists of an application identifier that references an application detection filter that is used for matching user plane packets. The application identifier is also identifying the application, for which the rule applies. The same application identifier value can occur in more than one PCC rule with the following restrictions:\n-\tThe same application identifier value can be used for a dynamic PCC rule and one or multiple predefined PCC rules. If so, the PCRF shall ensure that there is at most one PCC rule active per application identifier value at any time.\nNOTE 4:\tThe configuration of the Application Identifier in the PCEF can include the set of information required for encrypted traffic detection as defined in Annex X.\nThe Mute for notification defines whether notification to the PCRF of application's starts or stops shall be muted. Absence of this parameter means that start/stop notifications shall be sent.\nThe Precedence defines in what order the activated PCC rules within the same IP‑CAN session shall be applied at the PCEF for service data flow detection. When a dynamic PCC rule and a predefined PCC rule have the same precedence, the dynamic PCC rule takes precedence. For dynamic PCC rules that contain an application identifier, the Precedence shall be either preconfigured at the PCEF or provided dynamically by the PCRF within the PCC Rules.\nNOTE 5:\tThe operator shall ensure that overlap between the predefined PCC rules can be resolved based on precedence of each predefined PCC rule in the PCEF. The PCRF shall ensure that overlap between the dynamically allocated PCC rules can be resolved based on precedence of each dynamically allocated PCC rule. Further information about the configuration of the PCC rule precedence is described in Annex G.\nNOTE 6:\tWhether precedence for dynamic PCC rules that contain an application identifier is preconfigured in PCEF or provided in the PCC rule from the PCRF depends on network configuration.\nFor downlink packets all the service data flow templates, activated for the IP‑CAN session shall be applied for service data flow detection and for the mapping to the correct IP‑CAN bearer. For uplink packets the service data flow templates activated on their IP‑CAN bearer shall be applied for service data flow detection (further details provided in clause 6.2.2.2 and the IP-CAN specific annexes).\nThe Charging key is the reference to the tariff for the service data flow. Any number of PCC Rules may share the same charging key value. The charging key values for each service shall be operator configurable.\nNOTE 7:\tAssigning the same Charging key for several service data flows implies that the charging does not require the credit management to be handled separately.\nNOTE 8:\tIf the IP flow mobility is supported and the tariff depends on what access network is in use for the service data flow, then a separate Charging key can be allocated for each access network, and the PCRF can set the Charging key in accordance with the access network in use.\nThe Service identifier identifies the service. PCC Rules may share the same service identifier value. The service identifier provides the most detailed identification, specified for flow based charging, of a service data flow.\nNOTE 9:\tThe PCC rule service identifier need not have any relationship to service identifiers used on the AF level, i.e. is an operator policy option.\nThe Sponsor Identifier indicates the (3rd) party organization willing to pay for the operator's charge for connectivity required to deliver a service to the end user.\nThe Application Service Provider Identifier indicates the (3rd) party organization delivering a service to the end user.\nThe Charging method indicates whether online charging, offline charging, or both are required or the service data flow is not subject to any end user charging. If the charging method identifies that the service data flow is not subject to any end user charging, a Charging key shall not be included in the PCC rule for that service data flow, along with other charging related parameters. If the charging method is omitted the PCEF shall apply the default charging method as determined at IP‑CAN session establishment (see clause 6.4). The Charging method is mandatory if there is no default charging method for the IP‑CAN session.\nThe Measurement method indicates what measurements apply to charging for PCC rule.\nThe Service Identifier Level Reporting indicates whether the PCEF shall generate reports per Service Identifier. The PCEF shall accumulate the measurements from all PCC rules with the same combination of Charging key/Service identifier values in a single report.\nThe Application function record information identifies an instance of service usage. A subsequently generated usage report, generated as a result of the PCC rule, may include the Application function record information, if available. The Application Function Record Information may contain the AF Charging Identifier and/or the Flow identifiers. The report is however not restricted to include only usage related to the Application function record information reported, as the report accumulates the usage for all PCC rules with the same combination of Charging key/Service identifier values. If exclusive charging information related to the Application function record information is required, the PCRF shall provide a service identifier, not used by any other PCC rule of the IP‑CAN session at this point in time, for the AF session.\nNOTE 10:\tFor example, the PCRF may be configured to maintain a range of service identifier values for each service which require exclusive per instance charging information. Whenever a separate counting or credit management for an AF session is required, the PCRF shall select a value, which is not used at this point in time, within that range. The uniqueness of the service identifier in the PCEF ensures a separate accounting/credit management while the AF record information identifies the instance of the service.\nThe Gate indicates whether the PCEF shall let a packet identified by the PCC rule pass through (gate is open) the PCEF, or the PCEF shall discard (gate is closed) the packet.\nNOTE 11:\tA packet, matching a PCC Rule with an open gate, may be discarded due to credit management reasons.\nThe QoS Class Identifier for the service data flow. The QoS class identifier represents the QoS parameters for the service data flow. The PCEF maintains the mapping between QoS class identifier and the QoS concept applied within the specific IP‑CAN. The bitrate information is separate from the QoS class identifier value.\nThe bitrates indicate the authorized bitrates at the IP packet level of the SDF, i.e. the bitrates of the IP packets before any IP‑CAN specific compression or encapsulation.\nThe UL maximum-bitrate indicates the authorized maximum bitrate for the uplink component of the service data flow.\nThe DL maximum-bitrate indicates the authorized maximum bitrate for the downlink component of the service data flow.\nThe UL guaranteed-bitrate indicates the authorized guaranteed bitrate for the uplink component of the service data flow.\nThe DL guaranteed-bitrate indicates the authorized guaranteed bitrate for the downlink component of the service data flow.\nThe 'Maximum bitrate' is used for enforcement of the maximum bit rate that the SDF may consume, while the 'Guaranteed bitrate' is used by the PCEF to determine resource allocation.\nThe UL sharing indication indicates that resource sharing in uplink direction for service data flows with the same value in their PCC rule shall be applied by the PCEF as described in clauses 6.1.14 and 6.2.2.4.\nThe DL sharing indication indicates that resource sharing in downlink direction for service data flows with the same value in their PCC rule shall be applied by the PCEF as described in clauses 6.1.14 and 6.2.2.4.\nThe Redirect indicates whether the uplink part of the service data flow should be redirected to a controlled address.\nThe Redirect Destination indicates the target redirect address when Redirect is enabled.\nThe Allocation and Retention Priority indicates the allocation, retention and priority of the service data flow. The ARP contains information about the priority level, the pre-emption capability and the pre-emption vulnerability. The Allocation and Retention Priority resolves conflicts of demands for network resources.\nThe Bind to Default Bearer indicates that the dynamic PCC rule shall be bound to the default bearer.\nThe PS to CS session continuity is present if the service data flow is a candidate for vSRVCC according to TS 23.216 [28].\nThe access network information reporting parameters (User Location Report, UE Timezone Report) instruct the PCEF about what information to forward to the PCRF when the PCC rule is activated, modified or removed.\nThe Monitoring Key is the reference to a resource threshold. Any number of PCC Rules may share the same monitoring key value. The monitoring key values for each service shall be operator configurable.\nThe Indication of exclusion from session level monitoring indicates that the service data flow shall be excluded from the IP-CAN session usage monitoring.\nThe Traffic Steering Policy Identifier(s) is a reference to a pre-configured traffic steering policy at the PCEF as defined in clause 6.11.1.\nThe Allowed Access Type applies only in case of NBIFOM. The Allowed Access Type indicates the IP-CAN type that is to be used for the transfer of traffic identified by the PCC rule. The PCEF uses the Allowed Access Type as input for the bearer binding. When network-initiated NBIFOM mode applies, the PCEF shall also create / modify / delete a corresponding Routing Rule for such a PCC rule at the UE as described in clause 6.1.18.2. When the Allowed Access Type is not provided within a PCC rule, the traffic identified by the PCC rule is to be transferred on the default NBIFOM access.\nThe Routing Rule Identifier applies only in case of NBIFOM. The PCRF provides it to the PCEF only when network-initiated NBIFOM mode applies.\nThe UL Maximum Packet Loss Rate indicates the maximum rate for lost packets that can be tolerated in the uplink direction.\nThe DL Maximum Packet Loss Rate indicates the maximum rate for lost packets that can be tolerated in the downlink direction.",

      "content": "Policy and charging control rule operations consist of activation, modification and de-activation of PCC rules.\nActivation of a dynamic PCC rule provides the PCC rule information to the PCEF via the Gx reference point.\nActivation of a predefined PCC rule provides an identifier of the relevant PCC rule to the PCEF via the Gx reference point.\nActivation of a predefined PCC rule, not known in the PCRF, may be done by the PCEF based on operator policy. The PCEF may only activate such predefined PCC rule if there are no UE provided traffic mapping information related to the IP‑CAN bearer. Further restrictions regarding the usage of predefined PCC rules are described in clause 6.3.1.\nAn active PCC rule means that:\n-\tthe service data flow template shall be used for service data flow detection;\n-\tthe service data flow template shall be used for mapping of downlink packets to the IP‑CAN bearer determined by the bearer binding;\n-\tthe service data flow template shall be used for service data flow detection of uplink packets on the IP‑CAN bearer determined by the bearer binding;\n-\tusage data for the service data flow shall be recorded (further details can be found in clause 6.1.2 Reporting and clause 6.1.3 Credit Management);\n-\tpolicies associated with the PCC rule, if any, shall be invoked.\n-\tfor service data flow detection with an application detection filter, the start or the stop of the application traffic is reported to the PCRF, if applicable and requested by the PCRF. In that case, the notification for Start may include service data flow filters, (if possible to provide) and the application instance identifier associated with the service data flow filters.\nA predefined PCC rule is known at least, within the scope of one access point.\nNOTE 1:\tThe same predefined PCC rule can be activated for multiple IP‑CAN bearers in multiple IP‑CAN sessions.\nA predefined PCC rule is bound to one and only one IP-CAN bearer per IP‑CAN session. For a predefined PCC rule whose service data flow cannot be fully reflected for the uplink direction in terms of traffic mapping information sent to the UE, the PCEF may apply the uplink service data flow detection at additional IP‑CAN bearers with non-GBR QCI of the same IP‑CAN session. The deactivation of such a predefined PCC rule ceases its service data flow detection for the whole IP‑CAN session.\nThe PCRF may, at any time, modify an active, dynamic PCC rule.\nThe PCRF may, at any time, deactivate an active PCC rule in the PCEF via the Gx reference point. At IP‑CAN bearer termination all active PCC rules on that bearer are deactivated without explicit instructions from the PCRF to do so.\nPolicy and charging control rule operations can be also performed in a deferred mode. A PCC rule may have either a single deferred activation time, or a single deferred deactivation time or both.\nA PCC rule with only a deferred activation time shall be inactive until that time. A PCC rule with only a deferred deactivation time shall be active until that time. When the rule activation time occurs prior to the rule deactivation time, the rule is inactive until the activation and remains active until the deactivation time occurs. When the rule deactivation time occurs prior to the rule activation time, the rule is initially active until the deactivation time, then remains inactive until the activation time, and then becomes active again. An inactive PCC rule, that has not been activated yet, is still considered to be installed, and may be removed by the PCRF.\nThe PCRF may modify a currently installed PCC rule, including setting, modifying or clearing its deferred activation and/or deactivation time. When modifying a dynamic PCC rule with a prior and/or new deferred activation and/or deactivation time, the PCRF shall provide all attributes of that rule, including attributes that have not changed.\nNOTE 2:\tIn this case, the PCRF omission of an attribute that has a prior value will erase that attribute from the rule.\nDeferred activation and deactivation of PCC rules can only be used for PCC rules that belong to the IP‑CAN bearer without traffic mapping information.\nNOTE 3:\tThis limitation prevents dependencies on the signalling of changed traffic mapping information towards the UE.\nDeferred modification of PCC rules shall not be applied for changes of the QoS or service data flow filter information of PCC rules.",

If received by the PCEF, it supersedes the Default charging method in the charging characteristics profile.\nUpon every interaction with the ERF, the PCRF may provide event triggers for the IP‑CAN session. Event triggers are used to determine which IP‑CAN bearer modification causes the ERF to re-request PCC rules. The triggers are listed in clause 6.1.4.\nThe semantics of the authorized QoS per bearer (UE-initiated IP‑CAN bearer activation/modification) and the authorized MBR per QCI (network initiated IP‑CAN bearer activation/modification) are captured in clause 6.2.2.4.\nThe Revalidation time limit defines the time period within which the PCEF shall trigger a request for PCC rules for an established IP‑CAN session.\nUpon every interaction with the PCEF, the PCRF and the OCS may activate / deactivate reporting changes of UE presence in Presence Reporting Area by setting / unsetting the corresponding event trigger or credit reauthorization trigger by providing the PRA Identifier(s) and additionally the list(s) of elements comprising the Presence Reporting Area for UE-dedicated Presence Reporting Area(s), as described in clauses 6.1.4 and 6.1.3, respectively.\nThe PCEF shall combine the requests from PCRF and the OCS.\nWhen the Change of UE presence in Presence Reporting Area is armed, i.e. when the PCRF or the OCS subscribes to reporting change of UE presence in a particular Presence Reporting Area and the reporting change of UE presence in this Presence Reporting Area was not activated before, the PCEF shall activate the relevant IP‑CAN specific procedure which reports when the UE enters or leaves a Presence Reporting Area (an initial report is received when the IP‑CAN specific procedure is activated). The PCEF reports the PRA Identifier(s) and indication(s) whether the UE is inside or outside the Presence Reporting Area(s), and indication(s) if the corresponding Presence Reporting Area(s) is set to inactive by the serving node to the PCRF and/or the OCS.\nNOTE:\tThe serving node can activate the reporting for the PRAs which are inactive as described in the TS 23.401 [17].\nWhen neither the PCRF nor the OCS are subscribed to change of UE presence in Presence Reporting Area for a particular Presence Reporting Area, the PCEF shall deactivate the relevant IP‑CAN specific procedure which reports when the UE enters or leaves a Presence Reporting Area.\nThe PCEF stores PCRF or OCS subscription to reporting for changes of UE presence in Presence Reporting Area and forwards the PRA Identifier(s) and indication(s) whether the UE is inside or outside the Presence Reporting Area(s) received from the serving node according to the corresponding subscription.\nWhen a PRA set identified by a PRA Identifier was subscribed to report changes of UE presence in Presence Reporting Area by the PCRF and/or OCS, the PCEF additionally receives the PRA Identifier of the PRA set from the serving node, along with the individual PRA Identifier(s) belonging to the PRA set and indication(s) of whether the UE is inside or outside the individual Presence Reporting Area(s), as described in TS 23.401 [17].\n6.4a\tTDF session related policy information\nThe purpose of the TDF session related information is to provide information that is applicable to the whole TDF session.

These shall override any possible predefined addresses at the TDF. If received by the TDF, it supersedes the Primary OFCS/OCS address and Secondary OFCS/OCS address predefined at the TDF.\nUpon the initial interaction with the TDF, the PCRF may provide Default charging method indicating what charging method shall be used in the TDF session for every ADC rule where the charging method identifier is omitted. If received by the TDF, it supersedes the defined Default charging method.\nIf Charging Characteristics are received by the PCRF from the PCEF, the PCRF may take them into account when providing Charging information and Default charging method to the TDF. In case the TDF receives both Charging Characteristics and Charging information and Default charging method parameters, the Charging Information and Default charging method shall supersede the values received in Charging Characteristics.\nUpon every interaction with the TDF, the PCRF may provide Maximum downlink bit rate and/or Maximum uplink bit rate for the TDF session.\nNOTE:\tTo avoid down-link packets being discarded in PCEF when TDF performs charging, the PCRF should set the Maximum downlink bit rate to the DL APN-AMBR.\nUpon every interaction with the TDF, the PCRF may provide event triggers for the TDF session. Event triggers are used to determine which event causes the TDF to re-request ADC rules. The triggers applicable for the TDF are listed in clause 6.1.4.\nThe ADC Revalidation time limit defines the time period within which the TDF shall trigger a request for ADC rules for an established TDF session.\n6.4b\tAPN related policy information\nThe purpose of the APN related policy information is to provide policy and charging control related information that is applicable to all IP‑CAN sessions of a UE to the same APN. The PCRF provides APN related policy information to the PCEF using the PCC provision procedure together with PCC rules or separately.\nTable 6.4b-1 lists the applicable PCC specific APN related policy information.\nTable 6.4b-1: PCC specific APN related policy information\nAttribute\nDescription\nPCRF permitted to modify the attribute\nScope\nAuthorized APN-AMBR\nDefines the APN-AMBR for the total bandwidth usage of non-GBR QCI traffic at the APN.\nYes\nAll IP‑CAN sessions for the same UE within the same APN\nSubsequent APN-AMBR (NOTE 1)\nDefines the APN-AMBR for the total bandwidth usage of non-GBR QCI traffic at the APN to be applied by the PCEF when the APN-AMBR change time is reached.\nNo(NOTE 2)\nAll IP‑CAN sessions for the same UE within the same APN\nAPN-AMBR change time (NOTE 1)\nDefines the time at which the PCEF shall apply the Subsequent APN-AMBR for the total bandwidth usage of non-GBR QCI traffic at the APN.\nNo(NOTE 2)\nAll IP‑CAN sessions for the same UE within the same APN\nNOTE 1:\tBoth parameters shall be provided together. The PCRF may provide up to four instances of them. If multiple instances are provided, the values of the APN-AMBR change time have to be different and should not be too close to each other in order to reduce the risk for signalling overload.\nNOTE 2:\tThe PCRF may replace all instances that have been provided previously with a new instruction. A previously provided Subsequent APN-AMBR or APN-AMBR change time cannot be individually modified.\nThe PCRF may provide the (unconditional) Authorized APN-AMBR in every interaction with the PCEF. The PCEF shall apply the Authorized APN-AMBR as APN-AMBR for all IP‑CAN sessions of the UE to the same APN and shall communicate the changed APN-AMBR to the UE.\nNOTE 1:\tThere is always an unconditional value for the APN-AM BR available at the PCEF. The initial value is received as Subscribed APN-AMBR in an access specific manner and the PCRF can overwrite it by providing an Authorized APN-AMBR.\nNOTE 2:\tIn order to reduce the risk for signalling overload, the PCRF should avoid simultaneous provisioning of Authorized APN-AMBR for many UEs (e.g. by spreading over time).\nThe Authorized APN-AMBR may be provided together with conditions, i.e. a list of RAT types and/or a list of IP-CAN types. One or multiple instances of conditional APN-AMBR, with different conditions, may be provided by the PCRF. The PCEF shall apply a conditional Authorized APN-AMBR as APN-AMBR only if the current RAT type and IP-CAN type match one of the RAT types and IP-CAN types specified in the conditions, respectively. Otherwise the PCEF shall apply the unconditional Authorized APN-AMBR as APN-AMBR. A changed APN-AMBR shall be communicated to the UE.\nNOTE 3:\tGuidance what conditional Authorized APN-AMBR value to use in case the current RAT type and IP-CAN type match multiple conditional Authorized APN-AMBRs is specified in stage 3.\nConditional Authorized APN-AMBR(s) are not applied for a PDN connection supporting NBIFOM.\nUpon PCRF changing the unconditional Authorized APN-AMBR or providing a conditional Authorized APN-AMBR, the PCEF shall discard any previously received conditional Authorized APN-AMBR.\nThe PCRF may provide the unconditional and/or one or multiple instances of conditional Authorized APN-AMBR together with an APN-AMBR change time, referred to as Subsequent APN-AMBR. When the APN-AMBR change time is reached, the PCEF shall apply the unconditional and/or conditional Subsequent APN-AMBR as unconditional and/or conditional Authorized APN-AMBR and discard any previously applied conditional Authorized APN-AMBRs.\nNOTE 4:\tThe modification is made in the same way as if the PCRF had modified the Authorized APN-AMBR at that point in time.\nUp to four instances of Subsequent APN-AMBR may be provided by the PCRF. The PCEF shall discard any previously received Subsequent APN-AMBR instances on explicit instruction as well as whenever the PCRF provides a new instruction for one or more subsequent changes to the APN-AMBR or any other subsequent parameter.\nNOTE 5:\tIn order to provide further Subsequent APN-AMBRs in a timely fashion the PCRF can use its own clock to issue the desired changes or use the Revalidation time limit parameter (clause 6.4) to trigger a PCEF request for a policy decision.",

      "content": "The specification of the PCC procedures and flows is valid for the general scenario. Access specific information is included in Annex A, Annex D, Annex H and Annex P.\nThe description includes procedures for IP‑CAN Session Establishment, Modification and Termination. The IP‑CAN Session modification comprises IP‑CAN bearer establishment, modification, termination, as well as unsolicited PCC decisions.\nThere are three distinct network scenarios for an IP‑CAN Session:\nCase 1:\tNo Gateway Control Session is required, no Gateway Control Establishment occurs at all (e.g. 3GPP Access where GTP-based S5/S8 are employed, as described in TS 23.401 [17] and the IP‑CAN specific Annexes, and non-3GPP accesses where GTP-based S2a or GTP-based S2b is employed, as described in TS 23.402 [18]).\nCase 2:\tA Gateway Control Session is required. The BBERF establishes a Gateway Control Session prior to any IP‑CAN session establishment. There are two sub-cases:\n2a)\tThe UE acquires a care of address (CoA) that is used for the S2c reference point. The same Gateway Control session applies for all IP‑CAN sessions using that CoA.\n2b)\tA Gateway Control Session is required, as described in TS 23.402 [18] and the IP‑CAN specific Annexes, Gateway Control Session Establishment, as defined in clause 7.7.1.Each IP‑CAN session is handled in a separate Gateway Control Session.\nThe PCRF determines at Gx and Gxx session establishment what case applies initially as follows:\n1.\tIf the BBERF, at establishment of the Gateway Controls Session, provides an APN, then case 2b applies for the IP‑CAN session.\n2.\tIf the BBERF, at establishment of the Gateway Controls Session, does not provide any APN, then case 2a applies for the UE. For this case, the PCRF expects tunnelling header information for each IP‑CAN session to be provided by the applicable PCEF.\n3.\tIf there is no Gateway Control Session for the UE with the same IP‑CAN type as indicated over Gx, case 1 applies.\nIn a handover procedure the applicable case may change for an IP‑CAN session. The PCRF determines the new case in the same manner as described above. Details are defined in each such procedure.\nThe procedures cover non-roaming, roaming with home routed access and roaming with access to a visited PDN.\nFor the non-roaming case, the H‑PCRF plays the full role of PCRF. The V‑PCRF is not applicable in this case.\nFor the roaming case with home routed access, the H‑PCRF interacts with the PCEF and, if the Gxx applies, the V‑PCRF interacts with the BBERF.\nFor the roaming case with visited access (a.k.a. local breakout in TS 23.401 [17] and TS 23.402 [18]), the V‑PCRF interacts with the PCEF and, if Gxx applies, the BBERF and, if Sd applies, the TDF.\nNOTE:\tThe roaming scenario (figure 5.1-4) with visited access is not applicable for traffic steering control.\nProcedures defined in this clause cover the traffic cases where the TDF is located on Gi/SGi interface.\nProcedures defined in clause 7 cover all the traffic cases where roaming partners both operate PCC. For limited PCC deployment scenarios, Annex K and Annex L specify the impacts to these procedures.\nIn the text describing the steps in each sequence diagram, the designation PCRF, without specifying V‑ or H‑, refers to the PCRF in non-roaming case and refers to either the V‑PCRF or the H‑PCRF in the roaming cases. The interpretation of the text \"PCRF\" is thus dependent on the network scenario.\nWhen NBIFOM (defined in TS 23.161 [43]) applies, the description of the flows in this clause 7 is complemented by the description of NBIFOM dedicated behaviours documented in clause 6.1.18.",

      "content": "This clause describes the signalling flow for IP‑CAN Session establishment as well as network prefix and/or IP address assignment to the UE. The AF is not involved.\nFigure 7.2-1: IP‑CAN Session Establishment\nThis procedure concerns both roaming and non-roaming scenarios. In the roaming case when a Gateway Control Session is used, the V-PCRF should proxy the Gateway Control Session Establishment information between the BBERF in the VPLMN and the H-PCRF over S9 based on PDN-Id and roaming agreements.\nFor the Local Breakout scenario (Figure 5.1-4) the V-PCRF shall proxy the Indication and Acknowledge of IP‑CAN Session Establishment over S9 between the PCEF in the VPLMN and the H-PCRF. For TDF and solicited application reporting, the V-PCRF shall generate ADC rules from PCC Rules containing application detection and control information as instructed by the H-PCRF over S9. Then, the V-PCRF shall install PCC Rules to the PCEF and ADC Rules to the TDF, if applicable.\nIn the non-roaming case (Figure 5.1-1) the V-PCRF is not involved.\n1.\tThe BBERF initiates a Gateway Control Session Establishment procedure as defined in clause 7.7.1 (applicable to case 2a during initial attach and case 2b, as defined in clause 7.1).\n2.\tThe GW (PCEF) receives a request for IP‑CAN Bearer establishment. A PDN Connection Identifier may be included in the request. The GW (PCEF) accepts the request and assigns an IP address and (if requested) network prefix for the user.\n3.\tThe PCEF determines that the PCC authorization is required, requests the authorization of allowed service(s) and PCC Rules information. The PCEF includes the following information: UE Identity (e.g. MN NAI), a PDN identifier (e.g. APN), the IP‑CAN type and the IPv4 address and IPv6 network prefix, if available, the PDN Connection Identifier received for IP‑CAN Bearer establishment if multiple PDN connections to the same APN are supported and, if available, the default charging method and the IP‑CAN bearer establishment modes supported and information on whether PCEF is enhanced with ADC. It may also include the TDF IP address, in case of solicited application reporting, if applicable. If the UE has declared support for the extended TFT filter format and the PCEF does not prevent the use thereof, then the PCEF shall indicate that support to the PCRF. The PDN identifier, IP address(es) and UE identity enables identification of the IP‑CAN session. The IP‑CAN Type identifies the type of access from which the IP‑CAN session is established. If the service data flow is tunnelled at the BBERF, the PCEF shall provide information about the mobility protocol tunnelling encapsulation header. The PCEF may also include the Default Bearer QoS and APN-AMBR (applicable to case 1 and case 2a, as defined in clause 7.1). In case 2a the PCEF may also include charging ID information. If the GW/PCEF allocates a shorter IPv6 prefix for use with IPv6 Prefix Delegation, the GW/PCEF provides this shorter prefix as the IPv6 network prefix. If Charging Characteristics were received by GW/PCEF according to TS 23.401 [17] and TS 23.402 [18], the GW/PCEF also forwards Charging Characteristics to the PCRF. Based on local configuration the GW/PCEF may also include the following information: its control plane IPv4 and/or IPv6 address(es), an indication on how the APN was selected, indications on whether IP address(es) where statically or dynamically allocated, and the charging identifier of the default bearer to identify different records belonging to the same PDN connection, indication on whether the charging identifier is the only one for the IP‑CAN session. When the PCEF has received the IMEI(SV) in the request for IP‑CAN Bearer establishment received at step 2, the PCEF shall transfer this information to the PCRF.\nNOTE 1:\tIn case of TDF and solicited application reporting, either PCEF informs PCRF with TDF IP address, or PCRF has it preconfigured per each one of PCEFs.\n4.\tIf the PCRF does not have the subscriber's subscription related information, it sends a request to the SPR in order to receive the information related to the IP‑CAN session. The PCRF provides the subscriber ID and, if applicable, the PDN identifier to the SPR. The PCRF may request notifications from the SPR on changes in the subscription information.\n5.\tThe PCRF stores the subscription related information containing the information about the allowed service(s) and PCC Rules information, and may include MPS EPS Priority, MPS Priority Level and IMS Signalling Priority for establishing a PS session with priority and may also include user profile configuration indicating whether application detection and control should be enabled for the IP-CAN session.\n6.\tIf the PCRF determines that the policy decision depends on the status of the policy counters available at the OCS and such reporting is not established for the subscriber, the PCRF sends an Initial Spending Limit Report Request as defined in clause 7.9.1. If policy counter status reporting is already established for the subscriber, and the PCRF determines that the status of additional policy counters are required, the PCRF sends an Intermediate Spending Limit Report Request as defined in clause 7.9.2.\n7.\tThe PCRF makes the authorization and policy decision. If MPS EPS Priority, MPS Priority Level, and IMS Signalling Priority are present for the user, the PCRF takes the information into account.\n8.\tFor the solicited application reporting, the PCRF requests the TDF to establish the relevant session towards PCRF and provides ADC Rules to the TDF, as per user profile configuration, if traffic steering control over Sd applies, ADC Rules may contain traffic steering control information. The PCRF shall include the following information: a PDN identifier (e.g. APN), the IPv4 address and/or IPv6 network prefix, if available, and may also include the UE Identity Information and the location/access network information, if available. If Charging Characteristics were received by the PCRF according to step 3 and charging is applicable for the TDF, the PCRF shall also forward received Charging Characteristics to the TDF. Additionally, if received from the PCEF and if charging is applicable for the TDF, the PCRF shall also forward the following parameters to the TDF: the GW/PCEF control plane IPv4 and/or IPv6 address (es), an indication on how the APN was selected, indications on whether IP address (es) where statically or dynamically allocated, and the PDN charging identifier of the default bearer. The PCRF may also subscribe to the Event Triggers applicable for the TDF, according to table 6.2.\nNOTE 2:\tIf Charging Characteristics are received by the PCRF from the PCEF, PCRF may take them into account when providing Charging information and Default charging method to the TDF.\n9.\tIf online charging is applicable for the TDF, and at least one ADC rule with charging parameters was activated, the TDF activates the online charging session, and provides relevant input information for the OCS decision. Depending on operator configuration, the TDF may request credit from the OCS for each charging key of the activated ADC rules.\n10.\tIf online charging is applicable for the TDF, the OCS provides the possible credit information to the TDF and may provide re-authorisation triggers for each of the credits.\n11.\tThe TDF sends an Ack (accept or reject of the ADC rule operation(s)) to inform the PCRF about the outcome of the actions related to the decision(s) received in step 8. The Ack also includes the list of Event Triggers to report, including the case when the OCS provides any credit re-authorisation trigger, e.g. PLMN change, Location change (serving CN node), which cannot be monitored at the TDF. The Event Triggers indicate to the PCRF what events to be forwarded from the PCRF to the TDF, once PCRF gets the corresponding Event Report from the PCEF/BBERF.\n12.\tIf traffic steering control over St applies, the PCRF determines the traffic steering control information needed for the IP-CAN session; the PCRF provides the UE IPv4 address and/or UE IPv6 prefix and one or more sets of traffic steering control information to the TSSF. The TSSF identifier is pre-configured on the PCRF per e.g. PCEF.\n13.\tThe TSSF sends an acknowledgement to the PCRF to inform the PCRF about the outcome of the actions related to the traffic steering control information received in step 12.\n14.\tThe PCRF sends the decision(s) including the chosen IP‑CAN bearer establishment mode and indicates whether the use of the extended TFT filter format is allowed in the IP-CAN session, to the PCEF. The GW (PCEF) enforces the decision. The PCRF may provide the default charging method and may include the following information: the PCC Rules to activate and the Event Triggers to report. If PCEF is enhanced with ADC, the applicable PCC rules are provided, according to the user profile configuration, if traffic steering control over Gx applies, PCC Rules may contain traffic steering control information. The Policy and Charging Rules allow the enforcement of policy associated with the IP‑CAN session. The Event Triggers indicate to the PCEF what events must be reported to the PCRF. If the TDF provided a list of Event Triggers to the PCRF in the previous step, the PCRF shall also provide those Event Triggers to the PCEF.\n15.\tIf online charging is applicable, and at least one PCC rule with charging parameters was activated, the PCEF activates the online charging session, and provides relevant input information for the OCS decision. Depending on operator configuration, the PCEF may request credit from the OCS for each charging key of the activated PCC rules.\n16.\tIf online charging is applicable, the OCS provides the possible credit information to the PCEF and may provide re-authorisation triggers for each of the credits.\nIn cases 2a and 2b, if the OCS provides any re-authorisation trigger, which cannot be monitored at the PCEF, the PCEF shall request PCRF to arrange those to be reported by the BBERF via the PCRF.\n17.\tIf at least one PCC rule was successfully activated and if online charging is applicable, and credit was not denied by the OCS, the GW (PCEF) acknowledges the IP‑CAN Bearer Establishment Request.\n18.\tIf network control applies the GW may initiate the establishment of additional IP-‑CAN bearers. See Annex A and Annex D for details.\n19.\tIf the PCRF in step 12 has requested an acknowledgement based on PCC rule operations, the GW (PCEF) sends the IP‑CAN Session Establishment Acknowledgement to the PCRF in order to inform the PCRF of the activated PCC rules result.",

This interaction is the response to the GW (PCEF) request in step 3.\nNOTE 3:\tStep 13 may be initiated any time after step 7.\n14.\tThe GW (PCEF) continues the IP‑CAN Session removal procedure.\n15.\tIf case 2a applies, the GW Control and QoS Rules Provision procedure as defined in clause 7.7.4 may be initiated to remove the QoS rules associated with the IP‑CAN session being terminated. This applies e.g. in case the Gateway Control Session shall remain to serve other IP‑CAN sessions.\nAlternatively, if case 2a applies and the PCRF determines that all QoS rules are to be removed and the Gateway Control Session shall be terminated, the PCRF-initiated GW Control Session Termination procedure as defined in clause 7.7.2.2 is initiated. This applies e.g. in case the UE is detached and the CoA acquired by the UE is not used for any other IP‑CAN session.\n16.\tIf online charging is applicable for the PCEF, the PCEF issues the final reports and returns the remaining credit to the OCS.\nNOTE 4:\tStep 16 may be initiated any time after step 13.\n17.\tThe OCS acknowledges that credit report and terminates the online charging session with the PCEF.\n18.\tThe PCRF sends a cancellation notification request to the SPR if it has subscribed such notification.

      "content": "This clause describes the signalling flow for the IP‑CAN Session modification initiated by the GW (PCEF). These modifications include IP‑CAN bearer establishment and termination as well as modification if the triggering conditions given to the PCEF are fulfilled.\nFor the PCEF enhanced with ADC, the reason for such a modification may be that a start or stop of application traffic that matches with one of the activated PCC Rules is detected.\nThe AF may be involved. An example of the scenario is authorization of a session-based service for which an IP‑CAN Session is also modified.\nFigure 7.4: IP‑CAN Session Modification; GW (PCEF) initiated\nThis procedure concerns both roaming and non-roaming scenarios. In the roaming case when home routed access applies (figure 5.1-3) or if case 2a applies (as defined in clause 7.1) for Local Breakout (figure 5.1-4), when a Gateway Control Session is used, the H‑PCRF may initiate a Gateway Control and QoS Rules Provisioning procedure towards the BBERF and proxy the information through the V‑PCRF over S9.\nFor case 2b in the Local Breakout scenario (figure 5.1-4) and if the Gateway Control Session is terminated locally at the V‑PCRF, the V‑PCRF shall initiate the Gateway Control and QoS Rules Provisioning procedure locally without notifying the H‑PCRF. For this case the V-PCRF shall proxy the Indication and Acknowledge of IP‑CAN Session Modification over S9 between the PCEF in the VPLMN and the H‑PCRF. If the AF is located in the VPLMN for this scenario, the V‑PCRF shall proxy AF session signalling over S9 between the AF and the H‑PCRF.\nNOTE 1:\tThe case when the AF resides in the VPLMN is not shown in the figure.\nIn the non-roaming case (figure 5.1-1) the V‑PCRF is not involved at all.\n1.\tOptionally, the AF provides/revokes service information to the PCRF due to AF session signalling. The AF may subscribe at this point to notification of bearer level events related to the service information.\nNOTE 2:\tFor the PCRF to generate the applicable events, the PCRF instructs the PCEF to report events related to the corresponding PCC rules. Such events are not shown in this sequence diagram.\n2.\tThe PCRF stores the service information and responds with the Acknowledgement to the AF.\n3.\tThe GW (PCEF) may receive IP‑CAN session signalling for IP‑CAN Session modification. PDN Connection Identifier may be included in the IP‑CAN session signalling.\n4.\tThe GW (PCEF) makes a decision to trigger IP‑CAN Session modification either caused by the previous step or based on an internal decision or, e.g. if the GW (PCEF) enhanced with ADC, has detected the start/ stop of application traffic, requested by one of the activated PCC Rules.\n5.\tThe GW (PCEF) determines that the PCC interaction is required and sends an Indication of IP‑CAN Session modification (Event Report, affected PCC Rules, if available, the PDN Connection Identifier) to the PCRF together with, if available, User Location Information and/or UE Time Zone and RAN/NAS Release Cause and, if changed, the new IP‑CAN bearer establishment modes supported. If there is a limitation or termination of the transmission resources for a PCC Rule, the GW (PCEF) reports this to the PCRF. If flow mobility applies, the GW (PCEF) may include updated IP flow mobility routing information for any IP flows; the GW (PCEF) also provides an indication if default route for the IP‑CAN session is changed.\n6.\tThe PCRF correlates the request for PCC Rules with the IP‑CAN session and service information available at the GW (PCEF).\n7.\tThe PCRF may need to report to the AF an event related to the transmission resources if the AF requested it at initial authorisation.\n8.\tThe AF acknowledges the event report and/or responds with the requested information.\n9.\tIf the PCRF determines a change to policy counter status reporting is required, it may alter the subscribed list of policy counters using the Initial, Intermediate or Final Spending Limit Report Request procedures as defined in clauses 7.9.1, 7.9.2 and 7.9.3.\n10.\tThe PCRF makes the authorization and policy decision.\n11.\tFor the TDF solicited application reporting, the steps 11-14 take place. The PCRF provides all new ADC decisions to the TDF. This may include ADC Rules activation, deactivation and modification, if traffic steering control over Sd applies, ADC Rules may contain traffic steering control information. This may also include the list of Event triggers and also Event Report for the Event triggers, if reported by the PCEF/BBERF to the PCRF, if the TDF has previously subscribed for such an Event Report. In case of local breakout, the V-PCRF shall provide ADC rules generated from PCC Rules providing application detection and control as instructed by the H‑PCRF over S9.\nFor unsolicited application reporting and if the PCRF has recorded the release of an IPv4 address in step 5, the PCRF terminates the related Sd session.\n12.\tIf online charging is applicable for the TDF, the TDF may request credit for new charging keys from the OCS and/or may inform the OCS about re-authorization trigger if the event occurs and/or may issue final reports and return remaining credit for charging keys no longer active to the OCS.\n13.\tIf OCS was contacted by the TDF, the OCS provides the credit information to the TDF, and/or acknowledges the credit report.\n14.\tThe TDF sends an Ack (accept or reject of the ADC rule operation(s)) to inform the PCRF about the outcome of the actions related to the decision(s) received in step 11. The Ack also includes the list of Event Triggers to report, including the case when the OCS provides any credit re-authorisation trigger, e.g. PLMN change, Location change (serving CN node), which cannot be monitored at the TDF. The Event Triggers indicate to the PCRF what events to be forwarded from the PCRF to the TDF, once PCRF gets the corresponding Event Report from the PCEF/BBERF.\n15.\tIf traffic steering control over St applies, the PCRF determines if traffic steering control information needs to be modified/provisioned for the IP-CAN session; the PCRF provides to the TSSF the traffic steering control information associated to the UE IPv4 address and/or to the UE IPv6 prefix.\n16.\tThe TSSF sends an acknowledgement to the PCRF to inform the PCRF about the outcome of the actions related to the traffic steering control information received in step 15.\n17.\tThe PCRF sends an Acknowledge of IP‑CAN Session modification (PCC Rules, Event Triggers and, if changed, the chosen IP‑CAN bearer establishment mode) to the GW (PCEF). If traffic steering control over Gx applies, PCC Rules may contain traffic steering control information. The GW (PCEF) enforces the decision. If the TDF provided a list of Event Triggers to the PCRF in the previous step, the PCRF shall also provide those Event Triggers to the PCEF.\n18.\tIf online charging is applicable for the PCEF, the GW (PCEF) may request credit for new charging keys from the OCS and/or may inform the OCS about re-authorization trigger if the event occurs and/or may issue final reports and return remaining credit for charging keys no longer active to the OCS.\n19. If OCS was contacted by the PCEF, the OCS provides the credit information to the GW (PCEF), and/or acknowledges the credit report.\n20\tThe GW (PCEF) acknowledges or rejects any IP‑CAN Session signalling received in step 3.\nAn IP‑CAN bearer establishment is accepted if at least one PCC rule is active for the IP‑CAN bearer and in case of online charging credit was not denied by the OCS. Otherwise, the IP‑CAN bearer establishment is rejected.\nAn IP‑CAN bearer termination is always acknowledged by the GW (PCEF).\nAn IP‑CAN bearer modification not upgrading the QoS and not providing traffic mapping information is always acknowledged by the GW (PCEF). An IP‑CAN bearer modification is accepted if the provided traffic mapping information is accepted by the PCRF. Otherwise, the IP‑CAN bearer modification is rejected.\nIn case of a GW (PCEF) internal decision the GW (PCEF) initiates any additional IP‑CAN Session signalling required for completion of the IP‑CAN Session modification (applicable to case 1).\nIn case the IP‑CAN session modification is due to the BBF transitioning from a BBERF in the source access-network to the PCEF, the PCEF initiates IP‑CAN bearer signalling to activate bearers in the target access network (applicable to case 1).\n21.\tThe GW (PCEF) receives the response for the IP‑CAN Session signalling request (applicable to case 1).\n22.\tThe GW (PCEF) sends a Provision Ack (accept or reject of the PCC rule operation(s)) to inform the PCRF about the outcome of the GW (PCEF) actions related to the decision(s) received in step 15.\nNOTE 3:\tFor Cases 2a and 2b, the rejection of PCC rule operation can only occur as a result of online charging interaction.\n23.\tBased on the result of PCC rule operations, the PCRF decides whether to initiate a Gateway Control and QoS Rules provision procedure as defined in clause 7.7.4, if required to keep the PCC and QoS rules aligned (applicable to cases 2a and 2b, as defined in clause 7.1).\nIf there are multiple BBERFs associated with the IP‑CAN session, this step is performed with all the affected BBERFs.\n24.\tIf the AF requested it, the PCRF notifies the AF of related bearer level events (e.g. transmission resources are established/released/lost).\nNOTE 4:\tBased on the outcome reported in this step the AF performs the appropriate action, e.g. starting charging or terminating the AF session.\n25.\tThe AF acknowledges the notification from the PCRF.",

Additionally, the application instance identifier should be included in the report both for Start and for Stop of application traffic detection, when the service data flow descriptions are provided.\nFor unsolicited application reporting, the Sd reports the same application information to the PCRF unconditionally.

For the TDF solicited application reporting, the PCRF may provide a new ADC decision to the TDF. If the last ADC rule is deactivated, the PCRF requests the TDF to terminate the Sd session towards the PCRF. If there is no active Sd session yet between the TDF and the PCRF, the PCRF requests the TDF to establish the Sd session towards PCRF and provides an ADC decision to the TDF, if traffic steering control over Sd applies, ADC Rules may contain traffic steering control information. In case of local breakout, the V-PCRF shall provide ADC rules generated from PCC Rules providing application detection and control as instructed by the H‑PCRF over S9.\n6.\tIf online charging is applicable for the TDF, the TDF may request credit for new charging keys from the OCS and/or may inform the OCS about re-authorization trigger if the event occurs and/or may issue final reports and return remaining credit for charging keys no longer active to the OCS.\n7.\tIf OCS was contacted by the TDF, the OCS provides the credit information to the TDF, and/or acknowledges the credit report.\n8.\tFor the TDF solicited application reporting, in the case of an existing on-going session, if requested by the PCRF the TDF sends a Provision Ack (accept or reject of the ADC Rule operation(s)). For a new session, the TDF sends an Ack. This is to inform the PCRF about the outcome of the actions related to the received ADC decision(s). The Provision Ack / Ack also includes the list of Event Triggers to report, including the case when the OCS provides any credit re-authorisation trigger, e.g. PLMN change, Location change (serving CN node), which cannot be monitored at the TDF. The Event Triggers indicate to the PCRF what events to be forwarded from the PCRF to the TDF, once PCRF gets the corresponding Event Report from the PCEF/BBERF.\n9.\tIf traffic steering control over St applies, the PCRF determines if traffic steering control information needs to be modified/provisioned for the IP-CAN session; the PCRF provides to the TSSF the traffic steering control information associated to the UE IPv4 address and/or to the UE IPv6 prefix.\n10.\tThe TSSF sends an acknowledgement to the PCRF to inform the PCRF about the outcome of the actions related to the traffic steering control information received in step 9.\n11.\tIf there is no Gateway Control and QoS Rules Reply pending and there is a need to provision QoS rules, the PCRF initiates a Gateway Control and QoS Rules Provision Procedure as defined in 7.7.4 (applicable to cases 2a and 2b, as defined in clause 7.1).\nIf there are multiple BBERFs associated with the IP‑CAN session, Step 9 is performed with the BBERFs that support UE/NW bearer establishment mode.\nNOTE 6:\tIf there is a Gateway Control and QoS Rules Reply pending, e.g. this procedure was invoked from the Gateway Control and QoS Rules Request procedure as defined in clause 7.7.3, the PCRF shall use that opportunity for provisioning the applicable QoS rules.

      "content": "This clause describes the underlying principles for PCRF selection and discovery:\n-\tA single logical PCRF entity may be deployed by means of multiple and separately addressable PCRFs.\n-\tThe H‑PCRF must be able to correlate the AF service session information received over Rx with the right IP‑CAN session (PCC Session binding).\n-\tThe PCRF must be able to associate sessions established over the different reference points (Gx, Rx, S9, Gxa/Gxc, Sd, Np), for the same UE's IP‑CAN session. The actual reference points that need to be correlated depend on the scenario (e.g. roaming, LBO etc.).\n-\tIt shall be possible to deploy a network so that a PCRF may serve only specific PDN(s). For example, PCC may be enabled on a per APN basis.\nFor the case 2a (as defined in clause 7.1), the same PCRF shall support all the PDNs for which PCC is enabled and for which there are potential users accessing by means of case 2a (as defined in clause 7.1).\nIt shall also be possible to deploy a network so that the same PCRF can be allocated for all PDN connections for a UE.\n-\tA standardized procedure for contacting the PCRF is preferred to ensure interoperability between PCRFs from different vendors. The procedure may be specific for each reference point. The procedure shall enable the PCRF(s) to coordinate Gx, Rx and, when applicable, Gxa/Gxc, S9, Sd and Np interactions.\n-\tIt shall allow that entities contacting the PCRF may be able to provide different sets of information about the UE and PDN connections. For example:\n-\tThe AF has information about UE IP address and PDN but may not have user identity information.\n-\tThe PDN GW has information about user identity (UE NAI), the APN and the UE IP address(es) for a certain PDN connection.\n-\tFor case 2b as defined in clause 7.1, the S‑GW and trusted non-3GPP access has information about the user identity (UE NAI) and, the APN(s) but may not know the UE IP address(es).\n-\tFor case 2a as defined in clause 7.1, the trusted non-3GPP access has information about the user identity (UE NAI) and the local IP address (CoA) but may not know the APN or UE IP address(es) (HoA).\n-\tThe TDF (when the unsolicited application reporting applies) has the information about UE IP address, but may not have the UE identity.\n-\tThe RCAF has the information about the user identity (IMSI) and the APN.\n-\tThe DRA has information about the user identity (UE NAI), the APN, the UE IP address(es) and the selected PCRF address for a certain IP‑CAN Session.\nWhen the DRA first receives a request for a certain IP‑CAN Session (e.g. from the PDN GW), the DRA selects a suitable PCRF for the IP‑CAN Session and stores the PCRF address. Subsequently, the DRA can retrieve the selected PCRF address according to the information carried by the incoming requests from other entities (e.g. the AF or the BBERF).\nWhen the IP‑CAN Session terminates, the DRA shall remove the information about the IP‑CAN Session. In case of the PCRF realm change, the information about the IP‑CAN session stored in the old DRA shall be removed.\n-\tAll PCRFs in a PLMN belong to one or more Diameter realms. Routing of PCC messages for a UE towards the right Diameter realm in a PLMN is based on standard Diameter routing, as specified in RFC 3588, i.e. based on UE-NAI domain part. A Diameter realm shall provide the ability of routing PCC messages for the same UE and PDN connection to the same PCRF based on the available information supplied by the entities contacting the PCRF.\n-\tA PLMN may be separated into multiple Diameter realms based on the PDN ID information or IP address range. In this case, the relevant information (PDN ID, IP address, etc) shall be used to assist routing PCC message to the appropriate Diameter realm.\n-\tUnique identification of an IP‑CAN session in the PCRF shall be possible based on the (UE ID, PDN ID)-tuple , the (UE IP Address(es), PDN ID)-tuple and the (UE ID, UE IP Address(es), PDN ID).\n-\tStandard IETF RFC 3588 mechanisms and components, e.g. Diameter agents, should be applied to deploy a network where the PCRF implementation specifics are invisible for Diameter clients. The use of Diameter agents, including Diameter redirect agents, shall be permitted, but the use of agents in a certain deployment shall be optional.\nNOTE:\tFor the use of private UE IPv4 address TS 29.213 [22] provides guidance.",

In the roaming case when a Gateway Control Session is used, the V-PCRF should proxy the Gateway Control and QoS Rules Provision between the BBERF in the VPLMN and the H-PCRF over S9 based on PDN-Id and roaming agreements.\nIn the non-roaming case (Figure 5.1-1) the V-PCRF is not involved.\n1.\tThe PCRF is requested to update the QoS Rules and Event triggers for a Gateway Control Session.\n2.\tThe PCRF sends a Gateway Control and QoS Rules Provision to the GW (BBERF). It will include QoS Rules and Event Triggers. In case 2a a charging ID may be provided together with QoS rules. If the service data flow is tunnelled at the BBERF, the information about the mobility protocol tunnelling encapsulation header may be included. It is also possible that this interaction includes an Event Report originating from the GW (PCEF) and relayed by the PCRF to the BBERF. This Event Report enables a GW (PCEF)-originating interaction to be sent by way of the PCC infrastructure to the BBERF in situations that communication is needed between the GW (PCEF) and the GW (BBERF) and no interface exists between the GWs.\n3.\tThe QoS Rules and Event Triggers received by the GW (BBERF) are deployed. This may result in bearer binding being performed, according to the rules. Subsequent events corresponding to the Event Triggers will cause an Event Report to be delivered to the PCRF by means of a Gateway Control and QoS Rules Request procedure.\n4.\tThe GW (BBERF) initiates the IP‑CAN Bearer signalling if required for the QoS Rules and Event Triggers deployed in step 3.\n5.\tThe GW (BBERF) receives the response for the IP‑CAN Bearer signalling.\n6.\tThe GW (BBERF) sends a Gateway Control and QoS Rules Provision Ack (Result) to the PCRF.

The IMSI and the APN can be used to route messages.\n-\tAggregated RUCI report messages, which are sent between an RCAF and PCRF and contain congestion information for multiple UEs. A logical PCRF id is allocated for these aggregate messages which determine the destination of the message.\nThe congestion reporting takes place as shown in Figure 7.10.1 below.\nFigure 7.10.1: RUCI reporting from RCAF to PCRF\n1.\tRCAF indicates congestion information for a given UE and APN in a RUCI report message.

Alternatively, the RCAF may wait for a configurable period of time to aggregate information from multiple cells or eNBs into a single message. The amount of RUCI updates may be limited by configuring a minimum time between RUCI updates in the RCAF (e.g. when only the identifier of the congested cell serving the UE has changed).

Criteria such as the QoS subscription information may be used together with service-based, subscription-based, or a predefined PCRF internal policies to derive the \"Authorized QoS\" of a PDP context.\nNOTE:\tIf the PCRF provides authorized QoS for both the IP‑CAN bearer and PCC rule(s), the enforcement of authorized QoS of the individual PCC rules takes place first.\nA.1.1.4\tQoS control\nFor GPRS IP‑CANs it shall be possible to apply QoS control at APN-level.\nQoS control per APN allows the PCC architecture to control the authorized APN-AMBR to be enforced for the total bandwidth usage of non-GBR QCIs at the PCEF within the same APN.\nNOTE:\tFor the enforcement of the APN-AMBR for all IP‑CAN sessions to the same APN, the IP‑CAN is required to select the same PCEF for all of them.\nA.1.2\tArchitecture model and reference points\nA.1.2.1\tReference points\nA.1.2.1.1\tGx reference point\nThe Gx reference point enables the signalling of PCC rules, which govern the PCC behaviour, and it supports the following GPRS-specific functions:\n-\tIndication of PDP context activation, modification and deactivation.\nA.1.2.2\tReference architecture\nIn the GPRS IP‑CAN, the Bearer Binding and Event Reporting Function (BBERF) does not apply.\nA.1.3\tFunctional description\nA.1.3.1\tOverall description\nA.1.3.1.1\tBinding mechanism\nA.1.3.1.1.0\tGeneral\nAs explained in clause 6.1.1, the binding mechanism is performed in three different steps: session binding, PCC rule authorization and bearer binding. Session binding has no GPRS specifics.\nFor the authorization of a PCC rule with a GBR QCI the PCRF shall assign a GBR value within the limit supported by the serving network.\nNOTE:\tFor the authorization of PCC Rules with the same QCI the PCRF may also check that aggregated GBR is within the limits supported by the serving network to minimize the risk of rejection of the bearer by the serving network.\nFor the GPRS case bearer binding is performed by:\n-\tPCRF, when the selected operation mode is UE-only, see TS 23.060 [12], either due to PCRF decision or network/UE capability;\n-\tPCRF and PCEF (i.e. the PCRF performs the binding of the PCC rules for user controlled services while the PCEF performs the binding of the PCC rules for the network controlled services), when the selected operation mode is UE/NW.\nThe bearer binding performed by the PCRF shall bind a PCC rule that is authorized for a TFT packet filter to the PDP context the TFT packet filter has been assigned by the UE if the PCC rule can be authorized for the QCI of the PDP context. If a new PDP context is established, the PCRF can also bind PCC rule(s) to the PDP context if the QCI of the PDP context is different from the QCI, the PCC rule(s) can be authorized for since the PCRF can modify the QCI of the new PDP context. The binding mechanism shall comply with the established traffic flow template (TFT) packet filters (for the whole IP‑CAN session).\nThe bearer binding performed by the PCEF shall compare the PCC rule QoS parameters with the PDP context QoS parameters and bind a PCC rule:\n-\tto a candidate PDP context with a matching QoS class and Evolved ARP (if this is supported by the SGSN);\n-\tto a candidate PDP context with a matching QoS class and Evolved ARP (if this is supported by the SGSN) that, after modification of the bitrates, fulfils the PCC rule QoS demands;\n-\tto a new PDP context with a matching QoS class and Evolved ARP (if this is supported by the SGSN), if there is no suitable candidate PDP context present.\nThe bearer binding mechanism associates the PCC rule with the PDP context to carry the service data flow. The association shall:\n-\tcause the downlink part of the service data flow to be directed to the PDP context in the association, and\n-\tassume that the UE directs the uplink part of the service data flow to the PDP context in the association.\nThus, the detection of the uplink part of a service data flow shall be active on the PDP context, which the downlink packets of the same service data flow is directed to. The detection of the uplink part of the service data flow may be active, in parallel, on any number of additional PDP contexts.\nA.1.3.1.1.1\tBearer binding mechanism allocated to the PCEF\nWhen the bearer binding mechanism is allocated to the PCEF, no per bearer information is required to be communicated over the Gx reference point.\nOnce the PCRF has provided the PCC rule decisions at the IP‑CAN session establishment procedure, the PCRF shall provide further PCC rule decisions\n-\tusing the PCRF initiated IP‑CAN Session Modification procedure; or\n-\tin response to an event report from the PCEF (the GW (PCEF) initiated IP‑CAN Session Modification).\nThe bearer binding function shall not combine PCC rules with different ARP values onto the same PDP context.\nNOTE:\tIf Evolved ARP is not supported by the SGSN then this enables a modification of the PDP context ARP without impacting the bearer binding after relocation to a SGSN that supports Evolved ARP.\nA.1.3.1.1.2\tBearer binding mechanism allocated to the PCRF\nIf a PDP context is established/modified in order to successfully perform the bearer binding the PCRF will set the PCC rule as binding-pending status until the PCEF reports the establishment or modification of a PDP context that fulfils the PCC rule demands or the PCC rule is removed.\nThe following particularities apply when the bearer binding mechanism is allocated to the PCRF:\n-\tThe PCEF\n-\tshall include a bearer reference in all requests for PCC decisions;\n-\tshall report bearer QoS class identifier and the associated bitrates for new/modified PDP contexts;\n-\tshall report the TFT filter status for new PDP contexts and for modified TFTs;\n-\tshall report the deactivation of a PDP context\n-\tThe PCRF\n-\tshall provide the bearer reference for the binding result when activating a PCC rule;\n-\tshall arm the GPRS-specific IP‑CAN event trigger \"PDP context activity\".\n-\tshall arm the event trigger \"traffic mapping information change\".\nNOTE:\tFor the above case, the allocation of the bearer binding mechanism to the PCRF facilitates the migration from Rel-6 products to Rel-7 products. The allocation of the binding mechanism may be re-evaluated in future releases.\nWhen the PCRF performs the bearer binding the ARP information in the PCC rule shall be ignored unless the SGSN has indicated support for Evolved ARP.\nA.1.3.1.2\tReporting\nA container may be closed and a new container opened by the triggering of event triggers.\nA.1.3.1.3\tCredit management\nFor GPRS the PCEF shall initiate one credit management session for each PDP context.\nFor GPRS the credit re-authorisation triggers in table A.1-1 shall apply in addition to the ones in table 6.1. They are applicable both in case of PCEF and in case of TDF.\nTable A.1-1: GPRS specific credit re-authorization triggers\nCredit re-authorization trigger\nDescription\nSGSN change\nThe UE has moved to a new SGSN.\nRAT type change.\nThe characteristics of the air interface, communicated as the radio access type, have changed.\nLocation change (routeing area)\nThe routeing area of the UE has changed.\nLocation change (CGI/SAI)\nThe CGI/SAI of the UE has changed.\nUser CSG Information change in CSG cell\nUser CSG Information has changed when the UE enters/leaves/accesses via a CSG cell\nUser CSG Information change in subscribed hybrid cell\nUser CSG Information has changed when the UE enters/leaves/accesses via a hybrid cell in which the subscriber is a CSG member\nUser CSG Information change in un-subscribed hybrid cell (see note)\nUser CSG Information has changed when the UE enters/leaves/accesses via a hybrid cell in which the subscriber is not a CSG member\nNOTE:\tDue to the increased signalling load, such reporting should be applied for a limited number of subscribers only.\nIf the Location change trigger for CGI / SAI or RAI is armed, the GGSN should request the SGSN to report any changes in location to the level indicated by the trigger according to the procedures described in TS 23.060 [12]. If credit re-authorization triggers and event triggers require different levels of reporting of location change for different PDP contexts for a single IP-CAN session, the SGSN reports location changes to the highest level of detail required. However, the GGSN should not trigger a credit re-authorization if the report received is more detailed than requested by the OCS.\nIf the User CSG Information change in CSG cell trigger is armed, the GGSN should request the SGSN to report any changes in user CSG information when the UE enters/leaves/accesses via a CSG cell.\nIf the User CSG Information change in subscribed hybrid cell trigger is armed, the GGSN should request the SGSN to report any changes in user CSG information when the UE enters/leaves/accesses via a hybrid cell in which the subscriber is a CSG member.\nIf the User CSG Information change in un-subscribed hybrid cell trigger is armed, the GGSN should request the SGSN to report any changes in user CSG information when the UE enters/leaves/accesses via a hybrid cell in which the subscriber is not a CSG member.\nIf credit re-authorization triggers, event triggers and IP-CAN session related policy information require different levels of reporting of User CSG information for a single IP-CAN session, then the User CSG information to be requested from the SGSN should be changed to the highest level of detail required.\nChange of UE presence in Presence Reporting Area is not applicable for GPRS IP-CAN.\nA.1.3.1.4\tEvent Triggers\nFor GPRS the event triggers in table A.2 shall apply in addition to the ones in table 6.2 at the PCEF upon the request of the PCRF.\nNOTE: The request from the PCRF can be triggered by configured policy, or a request received from the TDF. In case of TDF, this may be a result of credit re-authorization trigger received by the TDF from the OCS.\nTable A.2: GPRS specific event triggers\nEvent trigger\nDescription\nSGSN change\nThe UE has moved to a new SGSN.\nRAT type change.\nThe characteristics of the air interface, communicated as the radio access type, have changed.\nPDP Context Activity\nThe GGSN has received a request for a PDP context activation, modification or deactivation.

(Note 2)\nUser CSG Information change in subscribed hybrid cell\nUser CSG Information has changed when the UE enters/leaves/accesses via a hybrid cell in which the subscriber is a CSG member. (Note 2)\nUser CSG Information change in un-subscribed hybrid cell (see note)\nUser CSG Information has changed when the UE enters/leaves/accesses via a hybrid cell in which the subscriber is not a CSG member. (Note 2)\n3GPP PS Data Off status change\nThe PCEF reports when the 3GPP PS Data Off status changes.\nNOTE 1:\tAvailable only when the bearer binding mechanism is allocated to the PCRF.\nNOTE 2:\tDue to the increased signalling load, such reporting should be applied to a limited number of subscribers only.\nIf the Location change trigger is armed, the GGSN should request the SGSN to report any changes in location to the level indicated by the trigger according to the procedures described in TS 23.060 [12]. If credit-authorization triggers and event triggers require different levels of reporting of location change for different PDP contexts for a single UE, the SGSN reports location changes to the highest level of detail required. However, the GGSN should not trigger a request for PCC rules if the report received is more detailed than requested by the PCRF.\nFor GPRS, the traffic mapping information is represented by the TFT information.\nFor GPRS, the loss/recovery of transmission resources is indicated by a PDP context modification changing the 'Maximum bitrate' UMTS QoS parameter to/from 0 kbit/s (as described in the PDP context preservation procedure in TS 23.060 [12]).\nThe User Location Report in the Access Network Information Reporting contains the CGI/SAI and when the PDP context is deactivated, information on when the UE was last known to be in that location.\nIf the User CSG Information change in CSG cell was provided as event trigger, the GGSN should request the SGSN to report any changes in user CSG information when the UE enters/leaves/accesses via a CSG cell.\nIf the User CSG Information change in subscribed hybrid cell was provided as event trigger, the GGSN should request the SGSN to report any changes in user CSG information when the UE enters/leaves/accesses via a hybrid cell in which the subscriber is a CSG member.\nIf the User CSG Information change in un-subscribed hybrid cell was provided as event trigger, the GGSN should request the SGSN to report any changes in user CSG information when the UE enters/leaves/accesses via a hybrid cell in which the subscriber is not a CSG member.\nIf credit re-authorization triggers, event triggers and IP-CAN session related policy information require different levels of reporting of User CSG information for a single IP-CAN session, then the User CSG information to be requested from the SGSN should be changed to the highest level of detail required.\nChange of UE presence in Presence Reporting Area is not applicable for GPRS IP-CAN.\nA.1.3.1.5\tPolicy Control\nFor GPRS the AF instruction to report changes of the IP‑CAN bearer level information Type of IP‑CAN shall also result in a reporting of RAT type changes, even if the IP‑CAN type is unchanged.\nA.1.3.2\tFunctional entities\nA.1.3.2.1\tPolicy Control and Charging Rules Function (PCRF)\nA.1.3.2.1.0\tGeneral\nThe PCRF shall upon indication of PCC rule removal due to PS to CS handover notify the AF that the associated flows are no longer served by the PS-domain due to PS to CS handover.\nA.1.3.2.1.1\tInput for PCC decisions\nThe PCRF shall accept any of the following input which the PCEF may provide, specific for GPRS, as a basis for decisions on PCC rule operations.\nThe following information represents GPRS specific values of the ones listed in clause 6.2.1.1:\n-\tSubscriber Identifier in the form of IMSI, MSISDN;\n-\tA PDN identifier in the form of APN;\n-\tA PLMN identifier in the form of SGSN Mobile Country Code and Mobile Network Code;\n-\tType of IP‑CAN set to GPRS;\n-\tIP‑CAN bearer attributes in the form of:\n-\tRequested QoS, for a PDP context;\n-\tTFT, to enable the identification of the corresponding PDP Context;\n-\tLocation of the subscriber in the form of CGI/SAI or RAI.\nThe following information is in addition to the ones listed in clause 6.2.1.1:\n-\tRAT type.\n-\tSubscribed APN-AMBR.\nThe SPR may provide the following information for a subscriber (in addition to the information in clause 6.2.1.1) connecting to a specific PDN:\n-\tAuthorized APN-AMBR.\nThe Authorized APN-AMBR is derived by the PCRF from SPR interaction, according to operator policy.\nA.1.3.2.2\tPolicy and Charging Enforcement Function (PCEF)\nA.1.3.2.2.1\tGeneral\nThis functional entity is located in the GGSN. The GGSN provides the GPRS-specific bearer QoS handling.\nThe PCEF shall contact the PCRF based on PCRF address information that shall be configured for the access point name (APN) together with the IMSI or MSISDN (if needed).\nThe PCEF shall maintain a 1:1 mapping from the GPRS QoS Class Identifier to a UMTS QoS profile and vice versa. Each GPRS QoS Class Identifier (QCI) parameter value has a 1:1 mapping to a set of QoS parameters defined for GPRS, TS 23.107 [14]. A recommended mapping is listed in table A.3.\nTable A.3: Recommended mapping for GPRS QoS Class Identifier to/from Release 99 UMTS QoS parameters\nGPRS\nUMTS QoS parameters\nQoS Class Identifier value\nTraffic Class\nTHP\nSignalling Indication\nSource Statistics Descriptor\n1\nConversational\nn/a\nn/a\nspeech(NOTE 1)\n2\nConversational\nn/a\nn/a\nunknown\n3\nStreaming\nn/a\nn/a\nspeech(NOTE 1)\n4\nStreaming\nn/a\nn/a\nunknown\n5\nInteractive\n1\nYes\nn/a\n6\nInteractive\n1\nNo\nn/a\n7\nInteractive\n2\nNo\nn/a\n8\nInteractive\n3\nNo\nn/a\n9\nBackground\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\nNOTE 1:\tThe operator's configuration should reserve QCI values that map to \"speech\" for service data flows consisting of speech (and the associated RTCP) only.\nNOTE 2:\tThis table defines the mapping for GPRS QCI to/from UMTS QoS parameters for pre-Release 8 GPRS. The characteristics of GPRS QCIs are independent from the standardized QCI characteristics for EPS.\nThe PCEF determines Release 97/Release 98 attributes from Release 99 attributes according to TS 23.107 [14].\nThe remaining UMTS QoS parameters are subject to operator's policies and either provisioned in the Create PDP Context Request or locally defined in GGSN.\nNOTE 3:\tAny change of the ARP parameter by the PCEF may get overwritten by the SGSN due to subscription enforcement unless the SGSN has indicated support for Evolved ARP.\nFor each PDP context, the PCEF shall accept information during bearer establishment and modification relating to:\n-\tThe user and terminal (e.g. MSISDN, IMEISV);\n-\tBearer characteristics (e.g. QoS negotiated, APN, IM CN Subsystem signalling flag);\n-\tNetwork related information (e.g. MCC and MNC).\nThe PCEF shall use this information in the OCS request/reporting or request for PCC rules.\nA GGSN may provide more than one APN for access to the same PDN. It should be possible to enable or disable PCC functionality for each APN, independent from the other APNs for access to the same PDN. Once the PCC functionality is disabled, regular GPRS charging and policy methods would be applied, i.e. no PCRF interaction would occur.\nFor each PDP context, there shall be a separate OCS request/OFCS reporting, so this allows the OCS and offline charging system to apply different rating depending on the PDP context.\nThe GGSN shall report the service data flow based charging data on a per PDP context basis.\nThe GGSN shall be able to request the SGSN to provide reports of changes in CGI/SAI/RAI of a UE as directed by the credit re-authorization triggers and/or event triggers.\nThe PCEF enforces QoS Policies as indicated by the PCRF in accordance to what is stated in clause 6.2.2.1 with the following additions:\n-\tAuthorized APN-AMBR enforcement. The PCEF shall enforce the authorized APN-AMBR received via the Gx interface for the total bandwidth usage of non-GBR QCI for the APN.\nOnly the GBR per bearer is used for resource reservation (e.g. admission control in the RAN).\nThe MBR (per PCC rule / per bearer) and the authorized APN-AMBR are used for rate policing.\nWhen the GGSN is connected to a SGSN that does not support the Evolved ARP, the GGSN shall map the Evolved ARP to Rel‑99 ARP parameter value as specified in Annex E of TS 23.401 [17].\nA.1.3.2.2.2\tService data flow detection\nFor uplink traffic, in the case of GPRS, all the uplink parts of service data flows templates, which are associated with the PDP context are candidates for matching in the detection process.\nNOTE:\tService data flow templates, which are not associated with the PDP context the packet was received, are not candidates for matching (dashed in the figure).\nA.1.3.2.2.3\tPacket Routeing and Transfer Function\nThe PCEF performs the packet routeing and transfer functions as specified in TS 23.060 [12], with the differences specified in this clause.\nFor the PDP address of an UE, the PCEF routes downlink packets to the different PDP contexts based on the downlink parts of the service data flow templates, in the active PCC rules and their routeing associations to the PDP contexts. The association between an active PCC rule and a PDP context shall correspond to the downlink TFT received from the UE. Each active PCC rule shall have a single routeing association to a PDP context. Upon reception of a packet, the PCEF evaluates the downlink part of the service data flow templates of the PCC rules activated for the PDP address in order of precedence to find a match. When the first match is found, the packet is tunnelled to the SGSN via the PDP context, for which the PCC rule has the routeing association. If no match is found, the PCEF shall silently discard the packet.\nThe UE shall define TFTs that enable successful binding at the PCRF for service data flows requiring a binding to occur.\nFor each uplink packet, the UE should choose the PDP context that is used for the downlink direction of the same service data flow, as declared in the TFT information. The PCEF shall only apply the uplink parts of the service data flow templates of the PCC rules, which are associated with the same PDP context as the uplink packet arrived on.\nThe packet filters, to be applied on dedicated signalling PDP contexts, shall form PCC rules, which shall be granted higher precedence than any other PCC rule and be active on the dedicated signalling context.\nA.1.3.2.2.4\tMeasurement\nThe details of measurement are specified in TS 32.251 [9].\nA.1.3.2.3\tApplication Function (AF)\nFor GPRS the AF instruction to report changes of the IP‑CAN bearer level information Type of IP‑CAN will also result in a reporting of RAT type changes, even if the IP‑CAN type is unchanged.\nThe AF instructions to report loss of transmission resources will result in a notification from the PCRF that may include an indication that the transmission resources are lost due to PS to CS handover.\nNOTE:\tThe AF action up to notification of termination of transmission resources due to PS to CS handover is application specific.

The IP‑CAN bearer is the PDP context and the IP‑CAN Session is established by the Create PDP Context message. The IP‑CAN Session is terminated when the last PDP Context of the specific IP address is deleted and the IP Address is released.\nA.1.4.2\tIP‑CAN Session Establishment\nThe IP‑CAN session establishment procedure (described in clause 7.2) is triggered at the GGSN by receiving a Create PDP Context Request message for the first PDP Context that is created for a new IP Address. The successful procedure results in an establishment of a UE IP Address and a PDP Context for the UE. The Create PDP Context Response message, indicating that a new PDP context is created, is sent to the SGSN. The response may include any changes in QoS according to bearer binding and policy enforcement.\nDuring the PDP context activation procedure, it shall be possible to forward the network capability of reporting of changes in CGI/SAI/RAI to the PCRF.\nThe PCRF also includes the Authorized APN-AMBR in the IP‑CAN Session Establishment Ack.\nA.1.4.3\tIP‑CAN Session Termination\nA.1.4.3.1\tUE initiated IP‑CAN Session termination\nThe UE initiated IP‑CAN Session termination procedure (described in clause 7.3.1) is triggered at the GGSN by receiving a Delete PDP Context request message if this is the deletion of the last PDP Context for the IP Address or the Teardown Indicator in the Delete PDP Context Request indicates that all PDP contexts that share the same IP address should be deactivated. All PDP Contexts in the IP‑CAN Session are deleted in the GGSN. The IP Address of the UE is released. The Delete PDP Context Response message, indicating that the PDP context(s) is deleted, is sent to the SGSN.\nA.1.4.3.2\tGW initiated IP‑CAN Session termination\nThe GW initiated IP‑CAN Session termination procedure (described in clause 7.3.2) is triggered if the GGSN detects that the IP‑CAN Session shall be terminated. The Delete PDP Context request message is sent by the GGSN to the SGSN.\nThis may be the deletion of the last PDP Context for the IP Address. If not, the GGSN shall set the Teardown Indicator in the Delete PDP Context Request message to indicate that all PDP contexts that share that same IP address shall also be deactivated. All PDP Contexts in the IP‑CAN Session are deleted. The IP Address of the UE is released. The Delete PDP Context Response, indicating that the PDP context(s) is deleted, is received from the SGSN.\nA.1.4.4\tIP‑CAN Session Modification\nA.1.4.4.1\tIP‑CAN Session Modification; GW (PCEF) initiated\nThe GW (PCEF) initiated IP‑CAN Session modification procedure (described in clause 7.4.1) is triggered at the GGSN by receiving one of the following messages:\n-\tCreate PDP Context Request message;\n-\tUpdate PDP Context Request message;\n-\tDelete PDP Context Request message;\n-\ta Change Notification message (indicating the new CGI, SAI or RAI) – see TS 23.060 [12].\nIn case of a Create PDP Context Request message, the modification of the IP‑CAN Session is the addition of a new PDP Context to the IP‑CAN Session. The new PDP Context is added with specific QoS requirements and traffic mapping information (TFT). A Create PDP Context Response message, indicating that a new PDP context is created, is sent to the SGSN. The response may include any changes in QoS according to bearer binding and policy enforcement.\nIn case of an Update PDP Context Request, a PDP Context in the IP‑CAN Session is modified. The modification may include modifying the QoS and/or the traffic mapping information. The Update PDP Context Response message, indicating that a PDP context is modified, is sent to the SGSN. The response may include any changes in QoS according to bearer binding and policy enforcement.\nIn case of a Delete PDP Context Request message, a PDP Context in the IP‑CAN Session is deleted. The Delete PDP Context Response message, indicating that a PDP context is deleted, is sent to the SGSN. .If the PS to CS handover indicator is set in a Delete PDP context request message , the PCEF reports termination of transmission resources for associated PCC Rules due to PS to CS handover.\nA Change Notification message indicating a change in CGI / SAI or RAI information is received when there are only changes regarding the current location of the UE. A change in CGI / SAI or RAI may also be notified within other session management messages.\nThe PCRF may provide the Authorized APN-AMBR in the Acknowledgement of the IP‑CAN Session Modification to the GW (in addition to the parameters in clause 7.4.1).\nBased on operator policy the PCRF may re-authorize MBR/APN-AMBR.\nA.1.4.4.2\tIP‑CAN Session Modification; PCRF initiated\nThe PCRF initiated IP‑CAN Session modification procedure (described in clause 7.4.2) may result in a GGSN initiated PDP Context Modification or Deactivation or a Network Requested secondary PDP Context Activation.\nIf a PDP Context in the IP‑CAN Session needs to be modified, the GGSN sends an Update PDP Context Request message. The modification may include modifying the QoS negotiated, negotiated Evolved ARP or the required CGI/SAI/RAI change reporting. The Update PDP Context Response message, indicating that a PDP context is modified, will be received from the SGSN.\nIf a PDP Context in the IP‑CAN Session needs to be deleted, the GGSN sends a Delete PDP Context Request message. The Delete PDP Context Response message will be received from the SGSN.\nIf the PCEF bearer binding yields that a new PDP context is required, the PCEF shall initiate the Network Requested secondary PDP Context Activation procedure.\nNOTE:\tIf online charging is applicable, with PCEF bearer binding and a new PDP Context is required, the PCEF may not have all the information (e.g. NSAPI and negotiated QoS) associated with that PDP context for the credit authorisation until the activation procedure is complete and therefore a second credit authorisation may be necessary to provide the remaining information.\nThe PCRF may provide the Authorized APN-AMBR in the Policy and Charging Rule Provision to the GW (in addition to the parameters in clause 7.4.2).\nA.2\tVoid\nA.3\tVoid\nA.4\t3GPP Accesses (GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN) - GTP-based EPC\nA.4.0\tGeneral\nFor 3GPP Access (GTP-based), architecture details are described in TS 23.401 [17] and in TS 23.060 [12].\nFigure A.1: The 3GPP EPS IP‑CAN (GTP-based)\nA.4.1\tHigh Level Requirements\nA.4.1.1\tCharging related requirements\nIt shall be possible for the charging system to select the applicable rate based on:\n-\tLocation with the granularity as specified for the credit re-authorization trigger Location change in clause A.4.3.1.1;\n-\tUser CSG Information, including CSG ID, access mode and CSG membership indication;\n-\tRAT type.\nA.4.1.2\tQoS control\nFor 3GPP Access (GTP based) it shall be possible to apply QoS control at APN-level.\nQoS control per APN allows the PCC architecture to control the authorized APN-AMBR to be enforced for the total bandwidth usage of non-GBR QCIs at the PCEF within the same APN.\nNOTE 1:\tFor the enforcement of the APN-AMBR for all IP‑CAN sessions to the same APN, the IP‑CAN is required to select the same PCEF for all of them.\nIf there is a QCI assigned to a PCC/QoS rule which is not supported by all RATs of the IP-CAN, the PCRF shall subscribe to the event trigger 'RAT change'. At inter-RAT mobility, the PCRF will be informed and shall then modify those PCC/QoS rules in the PCEF/BBERF to align their QCI values with those supported by the current RAT.\nNOTE 2:\tIt is assumed that the PCRF is configured with the same mapping rules as the MME.\nNOTE 3:\tSubscription to RAT changes ensure that the PCRF is invoked in case the UE moves to a RAT not supporting the assigned QCI in the PCC Rules as well as in case the UE moves back to a RAT supporting the originally assigned QCI. In the latter case, the PCRF can then modify the QCI in the PCC Rules back to the originally assigned value.\nIt shall be possible for the PCRF to authorize the QCI and ARP of the default EPS bearer to be enforced by the PCEF immediately and/or at a specific point in time by providing the default EPS bearer related policy information as defined in clause A.4.3.4.\nA.4.2\tArchitectural Model and Reference Points\nA.4.2.1\tReference architecture\nIn the 3GPP Access (GTP-based) architecture, see TS 23.401 [17] and in TS 23.060 [12],\n-\tthe Policy and Charging Enforcement Function (PCEF) is allocated to the PDN GW;\n-\tthe Bearer Binding and Event Reporting Function (BBERF) does not apply.\nA.4.3\tFunctional Description\nA.4.3.1\tOverall description\nA.4.3.1.1\tCredit management\nFor EPS the credit re-authorisation triggers in table A.4.3-1 shall apply in addition to the ones in table 6.1.

The \"SGSN change\" trigger and the \"Serving GW change\" trigger may be used to determine whether the UE is served by a S4-SGSN.

For GERAN/UTRAN in UE-only mode the Bearer Binding mechanism is restricted by the UE provided binding between a SDF and a bearer for UE initiated resource requests.\nA PCEF supporting the Bind to Default Bearer PCC rule attribute shall bind a dynamic PCC rule with this attribute to the default bearer instead of using the bearer binding mechanism defined in clause 6.1.1.4 and keep the binding as long as this attribute remains set. When the PCRF removes the Bind to Default Bearer PCC rule attribute, the bearer binding mechanism as defined in clause 6.1.1.4 shall be applied by using the QoS Class Identifier and ARP values of the dynamic PCC rule. The PCEF support for the Bind to Default Bearer PCC rule attribute is optional, and shall be indicated to the PCRF.\nThe bearer binding mechanism associates the PCC Rule with the EPS bearer to carry the service data flow. The association shall:\n-\tcause the downlink part of the service data flow to be directed to the EPS bearer in the association; and\n-\tassume that the UE directs the uplink part of the service data flow to the EPS bearer in the association.\nThus, the detection of the uplink part of a service data flow shall be performed on the EPS bearer over which the downlink packets of the same service data flow is directed to.\nNOTE 2:\tFor GERAN/UTRAN in UE-only mode the detection of the uplink part of the service data flow may be active, in parallel, on any number of EPS bearers.\nWhen the PDN GW is connected to an SGSN via Gn/Gp (and thus a handover from UTRAN/GERAN to E-UTRAN is possible), the bearer binding in the PCEF shall not combine PCC rules with different ARP values onto the same PDP context. For the UE-only mode (which is based on a UE provided binding) PCC rules with different ARP values shall not be authorized for the same PDP context.\nNOTE 3:\tIf Evolved ARP is not supported by the SGSN then this enables a modification of the EPS bearer ARP without impacting the service assignment after a handover to E-UTRAN or after relocation to a S4‑SGSN or a Gn/Gp SGSN that supports Evolved ARP.\nA.4.3.1.4\tPolicy Control\nFor 3GPP Access (GTP based) the policy control functionalities should include the following functionality for QoS control (in addition to the functionalities listed in clause 6.1.5):\n-\tAuthorization and enforcement of the maximum QoS that is authorized for the total bandwidth usage of non-GBR QCIs at an APN.\n-\tAuthorization and enforcement of the maximum QoS allocated to the Default EPS bearer. The Default EPS bearer shall have a non-GBR QCI as defined in clause 4.7.2.1 of TS 23.401 [17].\nA.4.3.2\tFunctional Entities\nA.4.3.2.1\tPolicy Control and Charging Rules Function (PCRF)\nThe following information represents 3GPP EPS specific values of the ones listed in clause 6.2.1.1:\n-\tSubscriber Identifier in the form of IMSI, MSISDN;\n-\tType of IP‑CAN is set to 3GPP-EPS.\nThe PCEF may provide the following information (in addition to the information in clause 6.2.1.1):\n-\tSubscribed APN-AMBR;\n-\tDefault EPS Bearer QoS.\nThe SPR may provide the following information for a subscriber (in addition to the information in clause 6.2.1.1) connecting to a specific PDN:\n-\tAuthorized APN-AMBR for 3GPP Access;\n-\tAuthorized Default EPS Bearer QoS.\nThe Authorized APN-AMBR and the Authorized Default EPS Bearer QoS are derived by the PCRF from SPR interaction, according to operator policy.\nThe PCRF shall upon indication of PCC rule removal due to PS to CS handover notify the AF that the associated flows are no longer served by the PS-domain due to PS to CS handover.\nIf vSRVCC is supported in the serving network, the PCRF (V-PCRF if roaming) provides an indicator via Gx to the PCEF to indicate that vSRVCC is allowed for the flow corresponding to the video component of the voice/video call.\nThe PCRF shall provide SDF filters in the PCC rule as received in the packet filter information from the PCEF.\nIf the PCRF receives a request for addition of service data flow(s) with a reference to existing SDF filter identities (and by that to existing PCC rule(s)), the PCRF shall use the QCI or ARP of the existing PCC rule for the new service data flow(s).\nNOTE:\tThe reference to existing SDF filter identities informs the PCRF that the request is confined to an existing bearer, having bearer bindings with PCC rules that have the same QCI/ARP combination. Assigning a different QCI or ARP to the new SDFs would cause the procedure to fail, since the PCEF cannot map the new SDFs to another bearer.\nA.4.3.2.2\tPolicy and Charging Enforcement Function (PCEF)\nIn the 3GPP Access (GTP-based) architecture the PCEF enforce QoS Policies as indicated by the PCRF in accordance to what is stated in clause 6.2.2.1 with the following additions:\n-\tAuthorized APN-AMBR enforcement. The PCEF shall enforce the authorized APN-AMBR received via the Gx interface for the total bandwidth usage of non-GBR QCI for the APN.\n-\tAuthorized Default EPS Bearer QoS Enforcement. The PCEF receives the authorized QoS for the default bearer over Gx interface. The PCEF enforces it which may lead to the upgrade or downgrade of the default EPS Bearer QoS. The PCEF shall re-evaluate the bearer binding (as defined in clause 6.1.1.4) taking into account the default bearer QoS change and any PCC Rule operation requested by the PCRF.\nWhen the PDN GW is connected via Gn/Gp (and thus handover from UTRAN/GERAN to E‑UTRAN is possible), the PDN-GW shall map QoS parameters of EPS bearers and APN-AMBR (if not received via Gn/Gp) to/from Release 99 and Release 97/Release 98 QoS parameter values of PDP-contexts as specified in Annex E of TS 23.401 [17]. The PDN GW shall mediate Gn/Gp procedures so that PCRF experiences no difference compared to S5/S8 procedures.\nOnly the GBR per bearer is used for resource reservation (e.g. admission control in the RAN).\nThe MBR (per PCC rule / per bearer) and the authorized APN-AMBR are used for rate policing.\nA.4.3.2.3\tApplication Function (AF)\nThe AF instructions to report loss of transmission resources will result in a notification from the PCRF that may include an indication that the transmission resources are lost due to PS to CS handover.\nNOTE:\tThe AF action up to notification of termination of transmission resources due to PS to CS handover is application specific. IMS interprets that the PS to CS handover notification as SRVCC.\nA.4.3.3\tVoid\nA.4.3.4\tIP-CAN bearer and IP-CAN session related policy information\nFor EPS the IP‑CAN bearer and IP‑CAN session related policy information in table A.4.3.4-1 shall apply in addition to the ones in table 6.4 and table A.4.\nA Presence Reporting Area may be defined as a short list of TAs or eNBs and/or ECGI for E-UTRAN, a short list of RAs or SAIs or CGIs for UTRAN, and a short list of RAs or CGIs for GERAN.\nTable A.4.3.4-1: PCC related IP-CAN bearer and IP‑CAN session related policy information\nAttribute\nDescription\nPCRF permitted to modify the attribute\nScope\nAuthorized default EPS bearer QoS\nDefines the QCI and ARP of the default EPS bearer.\nYes\nIP‑CAN session\nSubsequent default EPS bearer QoS (NOTE 1)\nDefines the QCI and ARP of the default EPS bearer to be applied by the PCEF when the default EPS bearer QoS change time is reached.\nNo(NOTE 2)\nIP‑CAN session\nDefault EPS Bearer QoS change time (NOTE 1)\nDefines the time at which the PCEF shall apply the subsequent default EPS bearer QoS.\nNo(NOTE 2)\nIP‑CAN session\nNOTE 1:\tBoth parameters shall be provided together. The PCRF may provide up to four instances of them.\nNOTE 2:\tThe PCRF may replace all instances of Subsequent default EPS bearer QoS that have been provided previously with a new instruction. There is no operation to modify a previously provided instance of Subsequent default EPS bearer QoS and/or Default EPS Bearer QoS change time.\nThe purpose of the default EPS bearer related policy information in table A.4.3.4-1 is to provide QCI and ARP that is applicable to the default bearer of an IP‑CAN session. The PCRF may provide the authorized default EPS bearer QoS in every interaction with the PCEF. The PCEF shall apply the authorized default EPS bearer QoS for the IP‑CAN session, including the necessary bearer binding actions.\nIf dynamic PCC rules are used and the PCEF has indicated that it supports the PCC rule attribute Bind to Default Bearer, the PCRF may provide a subsequent default EPS bearer QoS together with a default EPS bearer QoS change time. When the default EPS bearer QoS change time is reached, the PCEF shall apply the corresponding subsequent default EPS bearer QoS as the new authorized default EPS bearer QoS for the IP-CAN session and perform the necessary bearer binding actions for all of the respective dynamic PCC rules. To keep dynamic PCC rules bound to the default bearer, the PCRF shall include the attribute Bind to Default Bearer in every dynamic PCC rule intended to remain bound to the default bearer.\nThe PCRF may provide up to four instances of subsequent default EPS bearer QoS.\nNOTE 1:\tIn order to reduce the risk for signalling overload, the PCRF can spread the provisioning of subsequent default EPS bearer QoS for many UEs over time.\nNOTE 2:\tThe bearer modification is made in the same way as if the PCRF had modified the authorized default EPS bearer QoS at that point in time.\nThe PCEF shall discard any previously received subsequent default EPS bearer QoS instances on explicit instruction as well as whenever the PCRF provides a new instruction for one or more subsequent changes to the default EPS bearer QoS or any other subsequent parameter.\nNOTE 3:\tIn order to provide further subsequent default EPS bearer QoS in a timely fashion the PCRF can use its own clock to issue the desired changes or use the Revalidation time limit parameter (clause 6.4) to trigger a PCEF request for a policy decision.\nNOTE 4:\tFor services that depend on specific APN-AMBR and/or QoS for the default EPS bearer (e.g. MPS session) the PCRF is responsible to ensure that no subsequent APN-AMBR or default EPS bearer QoS interfere with the service, e.g. by removing the subsequent APN-AMBR or default EPS bearer QoS before the respective change time is reached.\nA.4.3.5\tTDF session related policy information\nFor EPS the TDF session related policy information in table A.4a shall apply in addition to the ones in table 6.4a.\nA.4.4\tPCC Procedures and Flows\nA.4.4.1\tIntroduction\nFor the 3GPP Access (GTP-based), an IP‑CAN session is established by the Create Default Bearer message. The IP‑CAN session is terminated when the last EPS bearer of the IP‑CAN session is disconnected.\nFrom the network scenarios listed in clause 7.1, the Case 1 (no Gateway Control Session) applies.\nA.4.4.2\tIP‑CAN Session Establishment\nIn the case of IP‑CAN Session Establishment (described in clause 7.2), the PCEF provides to PCRF (in addition to the parameters described in clause 7.2): the User Location Information, Serving Network, Serving-GW address and RAT type.\nThe PCEF shall also forward the network capability of reporting of changes in CGI/SAI/RAI to the PCRF.\nThe PCRF includes, in the IP‑CAN Session Establishment Ack, PCC Rules with QCI and ARP matching the Authorized Default EPS Bearer QoS, Authorized APN-AMBR and Authorized Default EPS Bearer QoS. If bearer establishment mode is UE/NW, the PCRF may also include PCC Rules requiring a QCI and ARP different from the Default Bearer QoS and for which NW mode applies.\nA.4.4.3\tGW (PCEF) initiated IP‑CAN Session termination\nThe GW (PCEF) initiated IP‑CAN Session termination procedure (described in clause 7.3.2) has no 3GPP specific information.\nA.4.4.4\tIP‑CAN Session Modification\nA.4.4.4.1\tIP‑CAN Session Modification; GW (PCEF) initiated\nFor IP‑CAN session modification (described in clause 7.4.1) the PCEF includes the modification of any of the 3GPP specific information listed in clause A.4.4.2.\nIf the PS to CS handover indicator is set for an IP-CAN bearer that is deleted, the PCEF reports termination of transmission resources for associated PCC Rules due to PS to CS handover.\nThe PCRF may provide the following parameters in the Acknowledgement of the IP‑CAN Session Modification to the PDN GW (in addition to the parameters in clause 7.4.1): Authorized APN-AMBR, Authorized Default EPS Bearer QoS.\nA.4.4.4.2\tIP‑CAN Session Modification; PCRF initiated\nThe PCRF may provide the following parameters in the Policy and Charging Rule Provision to the PDN GW (in addition to the parameters in clause 7.4.2): Authorized APN-AMBR, Authorized Default EPS Bearer QoS.\nWhenever the PCRF modifies the Authorized Default EPS Bearer QoS, the PCRF shall simultaneously modify the QCI and ARP of all PCC Rules that, according to the operator policy, shall have the same QoS as the default bearer.\nA modification of the Authorized Default EPS Bearer QoS requires that at least one PCC Rule with a matching QoS can be bound to the default bearer as defined in clause 6.1.1.4.\nNOTE:\tThe network configuration can ensure that at least one PCC Rule is bound to the default bearer by applying, either operator policies in the PCRF ensuring that a PCC Rule with matching QoS will be active or in the PCEF ensuring that a predefined PCC Rule not known to the PCRF is bound to the default bearer.\nA.5\t3GPP Accesses (GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN) - PMIP-based EPC\nA.5.0\tGeneral\nFor 3GPP Access (PMIP-based), architecture details are described in TS 23.402 [18].\nWhen PMIP-based S5/S8 has been deployed, the IP‑CAN-specific parameter exchange occurs by means of IP‑CAN Session Modification messages including the necessary information.\nA.5.1\tHigh Level Requirements\nA.5.1.0\tGeneral\nThe same requirements as in clause A.4.1 apply for 3GPP Access (PMIP-based).\nA.5.1.1\tQoS control\nFor 3GPP Access (PMIP based) the same requirements as defined in clause A.4.1.2 apply.\nA.5.2\tArchitectural Model and Reference Points\nA.5.2.1\tReference architecture\nIn the 3GPP Access (PMIP-based) architecture, see TS 23.402 [18],\n-\tthe Policy and Charging Enforcement Function is allocated to the PDN GW;\n-\tthe Bearer Binding and Event Reporting Function (BBERF) is allocated to the Serving GW.\nThe Gxx applies and corresponds to the Gxc, as defined in TS 23.402 [18].

If the bearer establishment mode is UE/NW, the PCRF may also include QoS Rules requiring a QCI and ARP different from the Default EPS Bearer QoS and for which NW mode applies.\nIn support of PDP Context Activation procedures over S4, the BBERF must indicate various session parameters, e.g. the RAT type, to the PCRF.\nThe PCRF may provide the following parameters in the Acknowledgement of the Gateway Control Session Establishment to the Serving GW (in addition to the parameters described in clause 7.7.1): Authorized APN-AMBR, Authorized Default EPS Bearer QoS.\nIf the PS to CS handover indicator is set for an IP-CAN bearer that is deleted, the BBERF reports termination of transmission resources for associated QoS Rules due to PS to CS handover.\nA.5.4.3\tGateway Control and QoS Rules Request\nIn the case of Gateway Control and QoS Rules Request (described in clause 7.7.3) the BBERF includes the addition/modification/removal of any the 3GPP specific information listed in clause A.5.4.2.\nWhen a change of RAT without S‑GW relocation occurs, the BBERF signals the RAT type change as a parameter in an event report sent from the BBERF to the PCRF. An event report is the then sent, indicating the RAT type change, from the PCRF to the PCEF.\nWhen Secondary PDP Context Activation occurs, the S4 SGSN performs a Request Bearer Resource Allocation procedure with the Serving GW. The Serving GW supplies the parameters required by the PCEF to properly handle the allocation of resources. These parameters are sent from the BBERF (Serving GW) to the PCRF for further processing when a PMIP-based S5/S8 is deployed.\nThe PCRF may provide the following parameters in the Acknowledgement of the Gateway Control and QoS Rules Request to the Serving GW (in addition to the parameters described in clause 7.7.3): Authorized APN‑AMBR, Authorized Default EPS Bearer QoS.\nFor the purpose of event reporting to the PCEF the BBERF may generate Event Reports to the PCRF if this has been requested by the PCRF.\nA.5.4.4\tGateway Control and QoS Rules Provisioning\nIn the case of Gateway Control and QoS Rules Provisioning (described in clause 7.7.4) the PCRF may provide the following parameters (in addition to the parameters described in clause 7.7.4) to the Serving GW: Authorized APN‑AMBR, Authorized Default EPS Bearer QoS.\nWhenever the PCRF modifies the Authorized Default EPS Bearer QoS, the PCRF shall simultaneously modify the QCI and ARP of all QoS Rules that, according to the operator policy, shall have the same QoS as the default bearer.\nA modification of the Authorized Default EPS Bearer QoS requires that at least one QoS Rule with a matching QoS can be bound to the default bearer as defined in clause 6.1.1.4.\nNOTE:\tThe network configuration can ensure that at least one QoS Rule is bound to the default bearer by applying operator policies in the PCRF ensuring that a QoS Rule with matching QoS will be active.\nFor the purpose of event reporting to the PCEF the PCRF may request Event Reports from the BBERF. In response to such request the BBERF shall provide the present value(s) of the event parameters.\nA.5.4.5\tIP‑CAN Session Establishment\nThe PCRF may provide the following parameters in the Acknowledgement of the IP‑CAN Session Establishment to the PDN GW (in addition to the parameters in clause 7.2): Authorized APN‑AMBR, User Location Information, user GSG information (if received from the BBERF).\nA.5.4.6\tIP‑CAN Session Modification\nA.5.4.6.1\tIP‑CAN Session Modification; GW (PCEF) initiated\nThe PCRF may provide the following parameters in the Acknowledgement of the IP‑CAN Session Modification to the PDN GW (in addition to the parameters in clause 7.4.1): Authorized APN‑AMBR.\nA.5.4.6.2\tIP‑CAN Session Modification; PCRF initiated\nThe PCRF may provide the following parameters in the Policy and Charging Rule Provision to the PDN GW (in addition to the parameters in clause 7.4.2): Authorized APN‑AMBR, User Location Information (if received from the BBERF), user GSG information (if received from the BBERF).\nA.5.4.6.3\tVoid\nAnnex B (informative):Void\nAnnex C (informative):Void\nAnnex D (informative):Access specific aspects (Non-3GPP)\nD.1\tDOCSIS IP‑CAN\nD.1.1\tGeneral\nIn the DOCSIS IP‑CAN, each UE is connected to the network via a Cable Modem (CM) which is connected through a Hybrid Fibre Coax (HFC) access network to a Cable Modem Termination System (CMTS). Though the UE and CM may or may not be embedded within the same physical package, they remain separate logical devices. One or more UEs may subtend a single CM. Because the CMTS provides the IP connectivity and traffic scheduling and manages quality of service for the CM and the UEs which subtend it, the CMTS fulfils the role of PCEF for the DOCSIS IP‑CAN. In the DOCSIS IP‑CAN, the Application Manager (AM) and the Policy Server (PS) fulfil the role of the PCRF.\nWhen accessing resources via a DOCSIS IP‑CAN, the Rx interface can be used to request resources. The communication between the AM and PS and the PS and CMTS uses the PKT-MM-2 interface which is based on COPS and defined in J.179. The remainder of this clause documents the mapping of PCC terminology to the DOCSIS IP‑CAN and how the DOCSIS IP‑CAN realizes the defined PCC functionality. This clause also establishes the requirements of the Rx interface as it is used for the DOCSIS IP‑CAN.\nThe PKT-MM-2 interface is shown here for information to illustrate the organization of the DOCSIS IP‑CAN. References that specify the PKT-MM-2 interface do not constitute normative requirements for the 3GPP architecture. The DOCSIS IP‑CAN does not intend to pose any new normative requirements for the Gx interface.\nFigure D.1.1: DOCSIS IP‑CAN\nD.1.1\tHigh level requirements\nD.1.1.1\tGeneral\nThe DOCSIS IP‑CAN employs for an IP‑CAN session, the concept of a DOCSIS registration.\nThe DOCSIS IP‑CAN employs for an IP‑CAN bearer, the concept of a DOCSIS service flow in order to provide an information path between the UE and the CMTS. Note that DOCSIS service flows are unidirectional, either upstream (toward the CMTS) or downstream (toward the CM). When a CM is registered in the DOCSIS IP‑CAN, it is assigned a unique IP Address and separate primary service flows are created for both the upstream and downstream direction These primary service flows are typically given best effort scheduling and are used to carry all IP traffic through the CM for which a more specific service flow has not been created. When a UE is registered in the DOCSIS IP‑CAN, it is assigned its own IP Address and is identified by its MAC address. A UE does not have a service flow assigned to it as a result of registration; rather it is associated with the primary service flows of the CM through which it is attached to the network. Additional bearers for the UE are created dynamically as required to provide appropriate QoS for service flows.\nBearer creation is triggered when media descriptors (Media Type and Format) for the SIP session are sent from the AF to the AM over the Rx interface. The AM translates the media descriptors into a QoS request for a DOCSIS service flow. The AM then forwards the QoS request towards the bearer enforcement point using the PKT-MM-2 interface. The PKT-MM-2 interface is not a 3GPP reference point, Specifications that detail the PKT-MM-2 interface do not impose normative requirements on the 3GPP architecture.\nThe following figure provides a graphical representation of the DOCSIS IP‑CAN and how it maps into the generic PCC terminology.\nFigure D.1.2: PCC to DOCSIS terminology mapping\nThe DOCSIS IP‑CAN defines an IP-Flow to be a unidirectional sequence of packets identified by OSI Layer 3 and Layer 4 header information. This information includes source/destination IP addresses, source/destination port numbers, protocol ID. Multiple Multimedia streams may be carried in a single IP Flow.\nIn a DOCSIS IP‑CAN, there is no equivalent concept as a service data flow. Further a DOCSIS service flow is uni-directional and each service flow is an aggregation of the QoS needs for all the IP-Flows which make up the service flow. As such, the QoS enforcement is done at the service flow level not at the IP-Flow level.\nD.1.1.2\tCharging related requirements\nD.1.1.3\tPolicy control requirements\nD.1.2\tArchitecture model and reference points\nD.1.2.1\tReference points\nD.1.2.1.1\tRx reference point\nD.1.2.1.2\tGx reference point\nD.1.2.1.3\tVoid\nD.1.3\tFunctional description\nD.1.3.1\tOverall description\nThe DOSCIS IP‑CAN employs for an IP‑CAN bearer, the concept of a DOCSIS service flow in order to provide an information path between the UE and the CMTS. When a Cable Modem is registered in the DOCSIS IP‑CAN, primary upstream and downstream service flows are created.\nWhen a UE is registered in the DOCSIS IP‑CAN it is associated with the primary service flows of the cable modem through which it is attached to the network. Based on session information provided by the AF using the Rx reference point, the Application Manager will determine QoS requirements for each IP flow. IP flows which do not require special quality of service treatment may be carried over the primary service flows. For other IP flows which require specific QoS treatment, the Policy Server requests the CMTS to admit the flows using the pkt-mm-2 interface providing detailed information of the QoS requirements. Provided that resources are available, the CMTS will create additional bearers dynamically and push the appropriate traffic filters to the cable modem.\nD.1.3.1.1\tBinding mechanism\nIn the DOCSIS IP‑CAN, the binding mechanism is achieved through the use of traffic Classifiers. These Classifiers filter traffic destined to a UE behind a Cable Modem or sourced from a UE behind a Cable Modem, to a particular DOCSIS service flow. DOCSIS Classifiers contain the following attributes which can be used to filter IP traffic:\n-\tIP Type of Service – Range and Mask;\n-\tIP Protocol;\n-\tIP Source Address;\n-\tIP Source Mask;\n-\tIP Destination Address;\n-\tIP Destination Mask;\n-\tTCP/UDP Source Port Start;\n-\tTCP/UDP Source Port End;\n-\tTCP/UDP Destination Port Start;\n-\tTCP/UDP Destination Port End.\nThe Classifier(s) which are used for a particular DOCSIS service flow are communicated to the CMTS by the Policy Server (on behalf of the Application Manager) via the pkt-mm-2 interface. The Application Manager will specify the QoS requirements for the IP flow, the direction of the IP flow, and the Classifier(s) which are to be used for the DOCSIS service flow serving the IP flow.\nWhen a session is no longer in use, the Application Manager communicates to the CMTS to tear down the resources associated with the session. Based on this communication, the CMTS will remove the DOCSIS service flow(s) and any Classifier(s) associated with the service flow(s), and inform the Cable Modem of the removal. Traffic which previously matched the removed Classifier(s) will now be placed on either the upstream or downstream primary DOCSIS service flow, depending on the direction of the traffic.\nD.1.3.2\tFunctional entities\nD.1.3.2.1\tPolicy Control and Charging Rules Function (PCRF)\nIn the DOCSIS IP‑CAN, the Application Manager (AM) and the Policy Server (PS) fulfil the role of the PCRF.\nThe AM receives media descriptors (Media Type and Format) from the AF for SIP sessions and maps the QoS needs of the session to a FlowSpec, The FlowSpec is a layer 2 independent representation of the bandwidth and QoS requirements for the flow derived from the media descriptors using a well defined algorithm. The AM and PS provide network resource control in the DOCSIS IP‑CAN by managing the CMTS using the PacketCable Multimedia interface pkt-mm-2.\nThe AM and PS map IP flows to DOCSIS service flows in accordance with the operator's policies and based on the media format information provided by the AF.\nD.1.3.2.1.1\tInput for PCC decisions\nThe AM accepts any of the following input as a basis for decisions on PCC rule operations:\n-\tPer IP‑CAN session (e.g.: UE IP address);\n-\tRequested QoS, media format, priority indicator.\nThe SPR may provide the following information:\n-\tSubscribers maximum allowed QoS resources.\nSubscriber's maximum allowed bit rate for upstream and downstream.\nD.1.3.2.2\tPolicy and Charging Enforcement Function (PCEF)\nThe CMTS provides PCEF equivalent functionality within the DOCSIS IP‑CAN. The CMTS creates, modifies, and deletes DOCSIS service flows upon request of the Policy Server. The CMTS receives requests from the Policy Server over the pkt-mm-2 interface.\nD.1.3.2.3\tApplication Function (AF)\nD.1.3.3\tPolicy and charging control rule\nD.1.3.3.1\tGeneral\nD.1.3.3.2\tPolicy and charging control rule operations\nD.2\tWiMAX IP‑CAN\nIn the WiMAX IP‑CAN, the UE (also referenced as Mobile Station or MS in IEEE 802.16 standards) connects to the WiMAX Access Service Network (ASN). The ASN logically communicates with a Connectivity Service Network (CSN) which is a collection of core networking functions (e.g. Mobile IP HA, AAA Server, DHCP, DNS etc.). The ASN manages traffic admission and scheduling, enforces QoS for an authorized UE and performs accounting functions for the UE (per session, flow, or UE). WiMAX PCEF is part of WiMAX IP‑CAN and is to be defined by WiMAX Forum [15]. WiMAX PCEF terminates the Gx reference point from the PCRF and may be a distributed enforcement architecture.\nThe PCC functional mapping to WiMAX IP‑CAN is shown in the following figure where PCC Gx and Rx are applied.\nFigure D.2.1: WiMAX IP‑CAN and 3GPP PCC\nD.2.1\tHigh level requirements\nD.2.1.1\tGeneral\nNo new requirements have been identified.\nD.2.1.2\tCharging related requirements\nNo new requirements have been identified.\nD.2.1.3\tPolicy control requirements\nNo new requirements have been identified.\nD.2.2\tArchitecture model and reference points\nD.2.2.1\tReference points\nD.2.2.1.1\tRx reference point\nWiMAX IP‑CAN imposes no new requirements to the Rx reference point.\nD.2.2.1.2\tGx reference point\nWiMAX IP‑CAN imposes no new requirements to the Gx reference point other than WiMAX specific values for existing Gx parameters (e.g. RAT type) as described in [15].\nD.2.2.1.3\tSp reference point\nWiMAX IP‑CAN imposes no new requirements to the Sp reference point.\nD.2.3\tFunctional description\nD.2.3.1\tOverall description\nThe WiMAX IP‑CAN employs for an IP‑CAN bearer, the concept of a WiMAX service flow, in order to provide a data path between the UE and the WiMAX CSN via the ASN. When a UE is registered in the WiMAX IP‑CAN, it is associated with one or more WiMAX service flows. Based on session information provided by the AF via the Rx reference point, the PCRF determines the QoS requirements for each service by constructing PCC rules. The PCRF requests the WiMAX IP‑CAN via Gx interface to enforce the authorized PCC rules on the WiMAX service flows. The PCEF function in the WiMAX IP‑CAN enforces the PCC rules received from the PCRF. Provided that resources are available, the ASN creates and configures logical bearers and enforces creation of appropriate traffic classes associated with service flows compliant with IEEE 802.16 standards for the air interface and IP‑CAN bearer capabilities in the ASN (e.g. DiffServ).\nD.2.3.1.1\tBinding mechanism\nD.2.3.1.2\tCredit management\nD.2.3.1.3\tEvent triggers\nD.2.3.2\tFunctional entities\nD.2.3.2.1\tPolicy Control and Charging Rules Function (PCRF)\nThe 3GPP PCRF is used for the WiMAX IP‑CAN. The PCRF interacts with WiMAX IP‑CAN using 3GPP Gx reference point.\nD.2.3.2.2\tPolicy and Charging Enforcement Function (PCEF)\nFor WiMAX IP‑CAN, PCEF functions may be distributed. It additionally:\n-\tTerminates the Gx reference point from PCRF and may act as a proxy for the PCRF.\n-\tHandles the enforcement function relocation in WiMAX IP‑CAN in a way that is transparent to the PCRF.\nD.2.3.2.3\tApplication Function (AF)\nWiMAX IP‑CAN imposes no requirements to the AF functionalities.\nD.2.3.3\tPolicy and charging control rule\nD.2.3.3.1\tGeneral\nD.2.3.3.1\tPolicy and charging control rule operations\nAnnex E (informative):Void\nAnnex F (informative):Void\nAnnex G (informative):PCC rule precedence configuration\nThe precedence information is part of the PCC rule (see clause 6.3.1) and instructs the PCEF in which order the service data flow templates of the active PCC rules needs to be analyzed when an IP packet arrives. This mechanism ensures that the service data flows can be correctly identified even if the service data flow templates contain overlapping service data flow filters.\nFor PCC rules that contain an application identifier (i.e. that refer to an application detection filter), the order and the details of the detection are implementation specific. Once an application has been detected, enforcement and charging shall however be applied under consideration of the PCC rule precedence, i.e. when multiple PCC rules overlap, only the enforcement and charging actions of the PCC rule with the highest precedence shall be applied.\nNOTE:\tThis ensures that traffic described by service data flow filters can be precluded from the enforcement of application detection filter based PCC rules if this is necessary (e.g. for sponsored data connectivity).\nWithin the PCC framework it is possible to use different types of PCC rules for which the service data flow templates may not always be known by the PCRF. Therefore, the PCC rule precedence information needs to be carefully configured to avoid certain situations e.g. a dynamic PCC rule cannot be applied for service data flow detection due to a predefined PCC rule not known to the PCRF with overlapping filter information and a higher precedence.\nFor example, an operator could structure the value range of the precedence information into separate value ranges (in decreasing order) for the different types of PCC rules as follows:\n-\tdynamic PCC rules;\n-\tpredefined PCC rules known to the PCRF;\n-\tpredefined PCC rules not known to the PCRF;\n-\tdynamic PCC rules for non-operator controlled services, i.e. those which are generated by the PCRF based on the UE provided traffic mapping information (and which take over the UE provided precedence information).\nAnnex H (normative):Access specific aspects (EPC-based Non-3GPP)\nH.1\tGeneral\nAn EPC-based non-3GPP IP‑CAN (TS 23.402 [18]), which requires the Gxa for dynamic QoS control, shall include the BBERF. The allocation of a BBERF to a node within the non-3GPP IP‑CAN is out of 3GPP scope, unless otherwise specified in this Annex.\nH.2\tEPC-based cdma2000 HRPD Access\nIn case of EPC-based cdma2000 HRPD access the BBERF is located in the HRPD Serving Gateway (HSGW) defined in 3GPP2 X.S0057 [20].\nThe HSGW of an EPC-based cdma2000 HRPD access that supports a Gxa interface shall support all the Gxa procedures defined in this specification.\nNOTE 1:\tIf the HSGW does not support the Gxa interface, the HSGW performs QoS enforcement in the HRPD access based on subscription-based QoS policies provided by the 3GPP AAA Server/Proxy during access authentication and/or static QoS policies configured in the HSGW. However, this is out of the scope of this specification.\nThe operator may configure an indicator in HSS which is delivered to the BBERF in HSGW within the Charging Characteristics and used by the BBERF to not establish the Gateway Control Session during the IP-CAN session establishment procedure.\nNOTE 2:\tThe decision to not establish the Gateway Control Session applies for the life time of the IP-CAN session.\nNOTE 3:\tThe indicator in the HSS is operator specific, therefore it can only be used in non-roaming cases.\nDuring the pre-registration phase in case of optimised EUTRAN-to-HRPD handovers, the Serving GW and the HSGW are associated with the IP‑CAN session(s) of the UE in the PCRF. The HSGW is the non-primary BBERF. For each PDN connection, if the UE has acquired an IPv6 prefix via the 3GPP access, the PCRF (H-PCRF in the home-routed case, V-PCRF in the local-breakout case) shall provide the IPv6 prefix of UE to the HSGW during the Gateway Control Session establishment procedure. In order to allow PCRF to link the new Gateway Control session to a Gx session based on the information received in the Gateway Control session establishment message, it is assumed that there is only a single IP-CAN session per PDN ID and IMSI.\nNOTE 4:\tThe HSGW performs QoS mapping between the QoS parameters exchanged across Gxa interface and the cdma2000 HRPD QoS parameters used within the HRPD access. However, this is out of the scope of this specification.\nFor EPC based cdma2000 HRPD access, the IP-CAN bearer establishment mode for all of the simultaneous IP‑CAN sessions between a UE and a PDN shall have the same value.\nNOTE 5:\tThe UE is supposed to assign the same BCM value and the PCRF is supposed to keep the value assigned by the UE.\nH.3\tEPC-based Trusted WLAN Access with S2a\nIn an EPC-based trusted WLAN Access with S2a, the PCEF is located in the PDN-GW and the BBERF does not apply.\nNOTE:\tGxa interface is not used for S2a-PMIP in Trusted WLAN within this Release of the specification.\nFrom the network scenarios listed in clause 7.1, the Case 1 (no Gateway Control Session) applies.\nSpecific event triggers applicable are listed in table H.3.\nTable H.3: TWAN access specific event/credit reauthorization triggers\nEvent/Credit reauthorization trigger\nDescription\nReported from\nCondition for reporting\nRAT type change.\nThe characteristics of the air interface, communicated as the radio access type, have changed.\nPCEF\nPCRF/OCS\nFor an IP-CAN session set-up over a Trusted WLAN Access with S2a:\n-\tat IP‑CAN Session Establishment the PCEF provides TWAN location information (TWAN ID and/or UE Time Zone as described in clause 16 of TS 23.402 [18]), IP-CAN type , RAT Type, PLMN identifier and an indication that access is trusted to the PCRF (over Gx). The TWAN ID may include the identifier of the operator of the TWAN as defined in clause 16 of TS 23.402 [18]. This occurs at step 3 of Figure 7.2-1 (IP‑CAN Session Establishment). This information is also provided by the PCEF to the charging entities as described in TS 32.251 [9].\n-\tThe Access Network Information Report event trigger defined in clause 6.1.4 applies. The user location information within the Access Network Information reporting contains the TWAN ID and/or UE Time Zone as described in clause 16 of TS 23.402 [18]. This information is sent when a bearer over Trusted WLAN access is activated or modified or deactivated and when the IP-CAN session is terminated. When the bearer over Trusted WLAN access is deactivated or the IP-CAN session is terminated the user location information corresponds to the last known UE location. When the IP‑CAN session is terminated a TWAN Release Cause (if available) is also provided to the PCRF.\nThe IP-CAN type change, the PLMN change event triggers defined in clause 6.1.4 and RAT type event trigger applies. The PCEF reports to the PCRF when a Create Session Request is received including information that the UE moved to a trusted WLAN access. This information is also provided by the PCEF to the charging entities as described in TS 32.251 [9].\nWhen the PCRF subscribes to any of the listed above event triggers using the Provision of PCC Rules procedure, the PCEF provides the parameter values in the response back to the PCRF, as defined in clause 6.1.4.\nIt shall be possible for the PCRF to authorize the QCI and ARP of the default EPS bearer to be enforced by the PCEF immediately or at a specific point in time by providing the default EPS bearer related policy information as defined in clause A.4.3.4.\nH.4\tEPC-based untrusted non-3GPP Access\nIn an EPC-based untrusted non 3GPP Access, the BBERF does not apply.\nSpecific event triggers and credit reauthorization triggers are listed in table H.4.\nTable H.4: Untrusted non-3GPP access specific event/credit reauthorization triggers\nEvent/Credit reauthorization trigger\nDescription\nReported from\nCondition for reporting\nRAT type change.\nThe characteristics of the air interface, communicated as the radio access type, have changed.\nPCEF\nPCRF/OCS\nFor an IP-CAN session set-up over an untrusted non-3GPP access over S2b:\n-\tAt IP‑CAN Session Establishment the PCEF provides IP-CAN type, indication that it is untrusted RAT type, ePDG IP address and the Serving Network Identifier to the PCRF. This occurs at step 3 of Figure 7.2-1 (IP‑CAN Session Establishment). This information is also provided by the PCEF to the charging entities as described in TS 32.251 [9]. The PCEF provides also the PCRF with User location information it may have received from the ePDG. As defined in TS 23.402 [18], this User location information may contain: ePDG IP address used in IKEv2 tunnel procedures. The local IP address and the UDP or TCP port number (if NAT was detected) detected by the ePDG as the source of the UE traffic over Swu.\n-\tWLAN Location Information and the WLAN Location Information Age. The TWAN ID within the WLAN location Information includes the identifier of the operator of the TWAN as defined in clause 16 of TS 23.402 [18].\n-\tThe IP-CAN type changes, the PLMN change event trigger defined in clause 6.1.4 and RAT type changes event trigger applies. The PCEF reports to PCRF when a Create Session Request is received including information that the UE moved to an untrusted WLAN access. This information is also provided by the PCEF to the charging entities as described in TS 32.251 [9]. As described for the case of an IP‑CAN Session Establishment, the PCEF provides also the PCRF with location information it may have received from the ePDG and the ePDG IP address used in IKEv2 tunnel procedures.\n-\tWhen the PCRF subscribes to any of the listed above event triggers using the Provision of PCC Rules procedure, the PCEF provides the parameter values in the response back to the PCRF, as defined in clause 6.1.4.\n-\tThe Access Network Information Report event trigger defined in clause 6.1.4 applies. As defined in TS 23.402 [18], the user location information within the Access Network Information reporting may contain:\n-\tThe local IP address and the UDP or TCP port number (if NAT was detected) detected by the ePDG as the source of the UE traffic over Swu.\n-\tWLAN Location Information and the WLAN Location Information Age.\nWhen the Access Network Information reported by the PCRF to the AF corresponds to the local IP address used by the UE to reach the ePDG, this information cannot be considered as reliable.\nNOTE 1:\tThis is because the UE can spoof its IP address.\n-\tWhen the IP-CAN session is terminated a UWAN Release Cause (if available) is provided to the PCRF. As defined in TS 23.402 [18], the User Location Information within the Access Network Information reporting may contain:\n-\tThe local IP address and the UDP or TCP port number (if NAT was detected) detected by the ePDG as the source of the UE traffic over Swu.\n-\tWLAN Location Information and the WLAN Location Information Age defined in TS 23.402 [18]\nWhen the PCEF receives no user location information from the ePDG, it provides at least information on the Serving Network of the ePDG.\nThe PCRF reports the ePDG IP address used in IKEv2 tunnel procedures to the AF (i.e. P-CSCF) at the time the AF instructions as described in clause 6.2.3 are received and the ePDG IP address is available, i.e. at the time the AF session is established and at the time the PCRF reports IP-CAN type change, if the AF (i.e. P-CSCF) subscribes to it.\nThe AF instruction to report changes of the IP‑CAN type is described in clause 6.2.3 including an indication that the access type is untrusted.\nNOTE 2:\tIn order to provide more detailed information to the AF about the characteristics of the access when the RAT type is unknown, the information on whether the access is untrusted is provided.\nIt shall be possible for the PCRF to authorize the QCI and ARP of the default EPS bearer to be enforced by the PCEF immediately or at a specific point in time by providing the default EPS bearer related policy information as defined in clause A.4.3.4.\nAnnex I (informative):Void\nAnnex J (informative):Standardized QCI characteristics - rationale and principles\nThe following bullets capture design rationale and principles with respect to standardized QCI characteristics:\n-\tA key advantage of only signalling a single scalar parameter, the QCI, as a \"pointer\" to standardized characteristics - as opposed to signalling separate parameters for resource type, priority, delay, and loss – is that this simplifies a node implementation.\nNOTE 1:\tTS 23.107 [14] permits the definition of more than 1600 valid GPRS QoS profiles (without considering GBR, MBR, ARP, and Transfer Delay) and this adds unnecessary complexity.\n-\tIn general, the rate of congestion related packet drops can not be controlled precisely for Non-GBR traffic. This rate is mainly determined by the current Non-GBR traffic load, the UE's current radio channel quality, and the configuration of user plane packet processing functions (e.g. scheduling, queue management, and rate shaping). That is the reason why services using a Non-GBR QCI should be prepared to experience congestion related packet drops and/or per packet delays that may exceed a given PDB. The discarding (dropping) of packets is expected to be controlled by a queue management function, e.g. based on pre-configured dropping thresholds, and is relevant mainly for Non-GBR QCIs. The discarding (dropping) of packets of an SDF aggregate mapped to a GBR QCI should be considered to be an exception as long as the source sends at a rate smaller than or equal to the SDF aggregate's GBR. Under these exceptional conditions, when required by operator policy, the eNodeB can be configured to also use the bearer's ARP priority level to assess the relative priority of packets belonging to different SDFs in determining whether to discard a packet or not.\n-\tAn operator would choose GBR QCIs for services where the preferred user experience is \"service blocking over service dropping\", i.e. rather block a service request than risk degraded performance of an already admitted service request. This may be relevant in scenarios where it may not be possible to meet the demand for those services with the dimensioned capacity (e.g. on \"new year's eve\"). Whether a service is realized based on GBR QCIs or Non-GBR QCIs is therefore an operator policy decision that to a large extent depends on expected traffic load vs. dimensioned capacity. Assuming sufficiently dimensioned capacity any service, both Real Time (RT) and Non Real Time (NRT), can be realized based only on Non-GBR QCIs.\nNOTE 2:\tThe TCP's congestion control algorithm becomes increasingly sensitive to non congestion related packet losses (that occur in addition to congestion related packet drops) as the end-to-end bit rate increases. To fully utilise \"EUTRA bit rates\" TCP bulk data transfers will require a PLR of less than 10-6.\nAnnex K (informative):Limited PCC Deployment\nLimited support for policy provisioning occurs in certain deployment scenarios.\nIf PCC is deployed in the HPLMN but not the VPLMN, dynamic policy provisioning only occurs in the home routed roaming cases if no BBERF is employed, or in the non-roaming scenarios.\nIn roaming scenarios in which the PCC is deployed in the HPLMN but not the VPLMN, and a GW (BBERF) is used:\n-\tlimited policy control is possible when the UE moves from the HPLMN to the VPLMN. In the VPLMN, the UE receives only service according to static policies or according to static subscriber policies, defined outside the PCC framework delivered as described in TS 23.402 [18]; the dynamically allocated resources associated with specific EPS Bearers no longer apply after this transition.\n-\tIf a UE moves from the VPLMN to the HPLMN, dedicated resource establishment procedures are used to dynamically allocate the appropriate resources in the HPLMN for EPS bearers.\n-\tPCC may still be employed to provision rules to the PCEF/TDF for the purpose of charging on the basis of the IP‑CAN session.\nWhen PCC is supported in the VPLMN and not in the HPLMN, dynamic policy may only be provided for the LBO case. As the VPCRF has no access to subscriber policy information from the HPLMN, only static policy will apply. The VPCRF may however interact with the AF in the VPLMN in order to determine dynamic policy operating entirely in the VPLMN. This policy will be enforced either in the PCEF or the BBERF or the TDF to be enforced entirely in the VPLMN. Bearer binding will occur under control of the VPLMN, either in the GW (BBERF) or in the GW (PCEF) (in the case of GTP-based S5/S8 for 3GPP access).\nAnnex L (normative):Limited PCC Deployment\nIn roaming scenarios in which the PCC is deployed in the HPLMN but not the VPLMN, and a GW (BBERF) is used:\n-\tHPCRF and OCS shall detect based on local configuration according to roaming agreements that the event reporting is restricted. The OCS shall not set re/authorization triggers which would require event reporting that can not be generated.\n-\tThe H-PCRF shall inform the AF of event triggers that cannot be reported. The H-PCRF shall inform the AF of events that cannot be reported when AF registers event trigger to the H-PCRF. When the H-PCRF detects limited PCC deployment, some event triggers which are dependent upon reporting from the BBERF cannot be reported. The H-PCRF shall inform the AF of events that cannot be reported when the UE is in or after the UE has handed over to an Access Gateway where the BBERF functionality is not deployed.\nAnnex M (informative):Handling of UE or network responsibility for the resource management of services\nFor access networks supporting network initiated resource signalling, the network can take over the responsibility for the resource management for a service. This means the network triggers the request for resources when the service is started or modified and triggers the release of the resources when the service is terminated. The UE remains responsible for starting the service or reacting to an incoming service signalling and needs to decide about how to proceed with the service if the desired resources are not available.\nAs the network initiated resource signalling cannot always be used due to UE, access network, roaming or other restrictions, the default responsibility for the resource management for a service is given to the UE. However, the UE and the PCRF may be configured on a per service basis to make use of the network responsibility for resource management if the current access network allows this, i.e. if network initiated resource signalling is possible. The UE configuration regarding the responsibility for the resource management of a service might be updated by device management.\nRegarding the PCC functionality, the main difference between the UE and the network responsibility for resource management is in the PCRF behaviour. When the UE is responsible, the PCRF waits with the authorization and installation of PCC rules until an appropriate resource request arrives. The main criteria for authorizing a PCC rule is a match of the service data flow filter information with the UE provided traffic mapping information, i.e. the UE desire to run this service on the requested resource. The QoS requested by the UE is then aligned with the authorized QoS for the PCC rules that are associated with the resource request by the PCRF.\nWhen the network is responsible for the resource management, the PCRF authorizes PCC rules immediately, i.e. when the IP‑CAN session is established and when new service information is received from the AF. The authorized PCC rules are installed afterwards.\nAnnex N (informative):PCC usage for sponsored data connectivity\nN.1\tGeneral\nWith sponsored data connectivity, the Sponsor has a business relationship with the operator and the Sponsor reimburses the operator for the user's data connectivity in order to allow the user access to an associated Application Service Provider's (ASP) services. Alternatively, the user pays for the connectivity with a transaction which is separate from the subscriber's charging. It is assumed the user already has a subscription with the operator.\nA possible deployment configuration for sponsored data connectivity in the non roaming case is illustrated in Figure N.1-1. In the roaming case a S9 reference point is present between the H-PCRF and the V-PCRF.\nNOTE 1:\tSponsored data connectivity is not supported in the roaming with visited access scenario in this Release.\nFigure N.1-1: Deployment for sponsored data connectivity\nThe relationship between the AF and Sponsor and between the Sponsor and ASP is out of scope of this specification. A single AF can serve multiple ASPs and multiple sponsors.\nNOTE 2:\tAn ASP can also be a sponsor.\nThe sponsor may choose to supply the PCRF (via the AF) with the usage thresholds that it expects the PCEF/TDF to enforce. Alternatively, the Sponsor can allow the ASP to enforce such control over the sponsored data connectivity.\nThe information required for the detection of sponsored HTTP traffic (i.e. server host name) can be verified with the corresponding server IP address/prefix of the IP packets by the PCEF/TDF. The PCEF/TDF uses implementation specific logic to perform this verification.\nN.2\tReporting for sponsored data connectivity\nThere are two deployment scenarios for usage reporting for sponsored data connectivity. The Sponsor Identifier and Application Service Provider Identifier are provided for sponsored services to the PCRF from the AF over the Rx interface.\nIn the first scenario the PCRF assigns a service specific Charging Key for a sponsored IP flow. The Charging key is used by the PCEF/TDF to generate separate accounting records for offline charging and and/or usage data records for online charging for the sponsored flows. Correlation of accounting records and usage data records from multiple users per sponsor and/or application service provider is then performed using the charging key.\nIn a second scenario the Sponsor Identifier and Application Service Provider Identity is included in PCC/ADC rules from the PCRF to the PCEF/TDF as defined in clause 6.3.1. For this scenario the same Charging Key may be used both for IP flows that are sponsored and for flows that are not sponsored. Accounting records generated by the PCEF/TDF for offline charging include the Sponsor Identity and the Application Service Provider Identity. Correlation of accounting records from multiple users per sponsor and/or application service provider can then be based on Sponsor Identity and Application Service Provider Identity instead of the Charging Key. Usage reporting for online charging including Sponsor Identity and Application Service Provider Identity has not been specified in this release of the specification. PCC/ADC rules that include a Sponsor Identity and an Application Service Provider Identity should include a Charging Method that indicates offline charging.\nAnnex P (normative):Fixed Broadband Access Interworking with EPC\nThis annex specifies the enhancement to PCC framework for supporting dynamic QoS interworking with Policy Framework defined by Broadband Forum.\nP.1\tDefinitions\nUE local IP address is defined as: either the public IPv4 address and/or IPv6 address/IPv6 network prefix assigned to the UE by the BBF domain in the no-NAT case, or the public IPv4 address assigned by the BBF domain to the NATed RG that is used for this UE.\nH(e)NB local IP address is defined as: either the public IPv4 address and/or IPv6 address/IPv6 network prefix assigned to the H(e)NB by the BBF domain in the no-NAT case, or the public IPv4 address assigned by the BBF domain to the NATed RG that is used for this H(e)NB.\nNon-seamless WLAN offload (NSWO) is a capability of routing specific IP flows over the WLAN access without traversing the EPC as defined in clause 4.1.5 of TS 23.402 [18].\nEPC-routed: User plane traffic that is routed via a PDN GW in EPC as part of a PDN Connection. EPC-routed applies to non-roaming, roaming with traffic home-routed and roaming with traffic local break-out cases.\nP.2\tAbbreviations\nThe following abbreviations are relevant for this annex only:\nBBF\tBroadband Forum\nBPCF\tBroadband Policy Control Function\nNSWO\tNon-Seamless WLAN offload\nNSWO-APN\tNon-Seamless WLAN offload APN\nP.3\tHigh Level Requirements\nThe same requirements as defined in clause 4 applies with the following exceptions:\n-\tno UE initiated resource reservation procedures are supported for EPC-based Fixed Broadband Access.\n-\tThe support of traffic steering control for the traffic in the (S)Gi-LAN is only applicable to the EPC-routed traffic of Home-routed scenario.\nIn addition, it shall be possible to.\n-\tperform resource reservation (e.g. admission control request to the Fixed Broadband Network) based on the bandwidth requirements and the QoS attributes of a service request for EPC-routed traffic in the Fixed Broadband network;\n-\tprovide information to identify a 3GPP UE in the Fixed Broadband Network.\n-\tperform resource reservation (e.g. admission control request to the Fixed Broadband Network) based on the bandwidth requirements and the QoS attributes of a service request for non-seamless WLAN offloaded traffic in the Fixed Broadband network. In this case the non-seamless WLAN offloaded traffic shall be managed by PCRF as an IP-CAN session identified by one IPv4 and/or an IPv6 prefix together with UE identity information and Non-seamless WLAN offload APN. The IP‑CAN session for NSWO exists as long as UE Local IP addresses/prefix is announced to the IP network and authorized by EPC. The NSWO-APN is an APN allowing the BPCF to indicate to PCRF that for subscribers of a certain HPLMN the IP-CAN session is related to NSWO traffic.\nNOTE 1:\tThe NSWO-APN is not used for the selection of a PDN GW.\nNOTE 2:\tDynamic provisioning from the HPLMN of NSWO-APN to BPCF is out of the scope of this Release.\nNOTE 3:\tThe naming convention of NSWO-APN is left to operator's implementation decision.\nP.4\tArchitecture model and reference points\nP.4.1\tReference points\nP.4.1.1\tS9a Reference point\nThe S9a reference point resides between:\n-\tthe PCRF in the PLMN and the BPCF in the Fixed Broadband Access Network (BPCF);\n-\tthe PCRF in the VPLMN (V PCRF) and the BPCF in the Fixed Broadband Access Network (BPCF).\nThe S9a reference point enables transfer of dynamic QoS control policies from the (V-)PCRF to the BPCF for the purpose of allocation of QoS resources in the Fixed Broadband Access Network for non-seamless WLAN offloaded traffic and for EPC-routed traffic.\nFor scenarios where the traffic is non-seamless WLAN offloaded in the Fixed Broadband Access Network, based on Rx authorizations and event subscriptions, or equivalent information, received by the BPCF from an AF in the Fixed Broadband Access Network, the S9a reference point enables the BPCF to send Rx authorizations and event subscriptions to the PCRF.\nNOTE:\tThe AF in the Fixed Broadband Access Network and the reference point between the AF in the Fixed Broadband Access Network and the BPCF are out of scope for this specification.\nP.4.1.2\tS15 Reference Point\nThe S15 reference point between the HNB GW and the PCRF and between the HNB GW and the V-PCRF. It enables the transfer of dynamic QoS control policies from the (V-)PCRF to the BPCF for the purpose of allocation of QoS resources in the Fixed Broadband Access Network for HNB CS calls.\nP.4.1.3\tGxx reference point\nWhen this reference point corresponds to the Gxb*, it transports access information for WLAN UEs such as the UE local IP address and the UDP port number. It is used scenarios in which the ePDG provides the access information via Gxb* to trigger the PCRF to initiate the S9a session i.e. S2b-PMIP and untrusted S2c.\nFor the case of H(e)NB with S5/S8 PMIP, this reference point corresponds to Gxc and the requirements in clause 5.2.7 applies. In addition for the purpose of fixed broadband access interworking, Gxc transports the H(e)NB Local IP address and the UDP source port, if available, in the fixed broadband access network where the H(e)NB connects to.\nP.4.1.4\tS9 reference point\nIn addition to the specification of the S9 reference point defined in clause 5.2.6, this reference point is used to trigger the V-PCRF to initiate the Gateway Control Session establishment over S9a. The S9 interface is enhanced to carry from the H-PCRF to the V-PCRF the UE local IP address, the UDP port number, if available, the H(e)NB local IP address and UDP port, if available, and the ePDG IP address (for S2b and untrusted S2c access) or the PDN GW IP address (for trusted S2c access), if available.\nP.4.1.5\tGx reference point\nIn addition to the specification of the Gx reference point defined in clause 5.2.2, this reference point is enhanced as described in the following. The IP-CAN establishment/modification request message, send from PCEF to PCRF, should include:\n-\tthe UE local IP address and the UDP port number, if available, when WLAN access and GTP is used.\n-\tthe UE local IP address and the UDP port number, if available, when trusted S2c is used.\n-\tthe H(e)NB local IP address and the UDP port number, if available, when UE accesses from H(e)NB and GTP S5/S8 is used.\nP.4.2\tReference architecture\nP.4.2.0\tGeneral\nThe reference architecture described in clause 5.1 is:\n-\textended to include S9a reference point to support fixed broadband access interworking to EPC for the following scenarios:\n-\tS9a reference point between PCRF and BPCF in the non-roaming case for traffic that is routed via EPC and for traffic that is non-seamless WLAN offloaded in the fixed broadband access network; and\n-\tS9a reference point between the V-PCRF and BPCF for roaming cases with visited access and home routed for traffic that is routed via EPC; and for traffic that is non-seamless WLAN offloaded in the fixed broadband access network;\n-\textended to include the S15 reference point as defined in clause P.4.1.2;\n-\tPCEF resides in the PDN GW;\n-\tfor WLAN access: BBERF resides in the ePDG. The BBERF only applies for cases 2b (i.e. S2b-PMIP, S2c-untrusted);\n-\tfor H(e)NB access with S5/S8 PMIP: BBERF resides in the Serving GW.\nThe UE may or may not be behind a NAT. The NAT may reside in the BBF access network or in the customer premises network. Policy interworking via S9a for non-seamless WLAN offloaded traffic in this release is supported for scenarios without NAT in the BBF domain.\nP.4.2.1\tReference architecture – Non-Roaming\nFigure P.4.2.1-1: PCC Reference architecture for Fixed Broadband Access Interworking\nP.4.2.2\tReference architecture – Home Routed\nFigure P.4.2.2-1: PCC Reference architecture for Fixed Broadband Access Interworking (home routed)\nP.4.2.3\tReference architecture – Visited Access\nFigure P.4.2.3-1: PCC Reference architecture for Fixed Broadband Access Interworking (visited access)\nP.4.2.4\tReference architecture - Non-Roaming with non-seamless WLAN offload in Fixed Broadband Access Network; scenario with AF\nFigure P.4.2.4-1: PCC Reference architecture for Fixed Broadband Access Interworking (non-roaming with non-seamless WLAN offload in Fixed Broadband Access Network)\nNOTE 1:\tThe architecture also supports scenarios where there is an Application Function in the Fixed Broadband Access Network. The AF in the Fixed Broadband Access Network and the reference point between the AF in the Fixed Broadband Access Network and the BPCF are out of scope for this specification.\nNOTE 2:\tThe AF in this architecture is used with traffic that is non-seamless WLAN offloaded in the Fixed Broadband Access Network.\nP.4.2.5\tReference architecture - Roaming with non-seamless WLAN offload in Fixed Broadband Access Network: scenario with AF\nFigure P.4.2.5-1: PCC Reference architecture for Fixed Broadband Access Interworking (roaming with non-seamless WLAN offload in Fixed Broadband Access Network)\nNOTE 1:\tThe architecture also supports scenarios where there is an Application Function in the Fixed Broadband Access Network.

Scenarios where non-seamless WLAN offloaded traffic is routed via the TDF are therefore limited to the case where the Fixed Broadband Access Network and the PLMN are owned by the same operator.\nP.4.2.7\tReference architecture - Roaming with non-seamless WLAN offload in Fixed Broadband Access Network: scenario with TDF\nFigure P.4.2.7-1: PCC Reference architecture for Fixed Broadband Access Interworking (roaming with non-seamless WLAN offload in Fixed Broadband Access Network)\nNOTE 1:\tThe TDF in this architecture is used with traffic that is non-seamless WLAN offloaded in the Fixed Broadband Access Network.\nNOTE 2:\tSd is an intra-operator interface. Scenarios where non-seamless WLAN offloaded traffic is routed via the TDF are therefore limited to the case where the Fixed Broadband Access Network and the VPLMN are owned by the same operator.\nP.5\tFunctional description\nP.5.1\tOverall description\nFor EPC based Fixed Broadband Access Interworking with EPC-routed traffic the credit management, reporting, usage monitoring, termination actions, service data flow prioritization and standardized QoS characteristics as defined in clause 6.1 shall apply.\nFor non-seamless WLAN offloaded traffic service data flow prioritization as defined in clause 6.1 applies. For scenario with TDF, usage monitoring as defined in clause 6.1 applies. For NSWO traffic in other scenarios, without TDF, usage monitoring is out of scope of this specification. For all scenarios, credit management, termination actions and reporting for NSWO traffic are out of scope of this specification.\nThe purpose of policy interworking via S9a for non-seamless WLAN offloaded traffic (PCC Rules provisioned for the UE local IP address) is to enable policy control in the BBF domain in two different ways:\n-\tGate enforcement. The BPCF is expected to provide information over R interface to control whether a service data flow, which is subject to policy control, pass through the BNG if and only if the corresponding gate is open.\n-\tQoS enforcement: The BPCF is expected to provide information over R interface to control the authorized QoS of a service data flow according to the QoS information received over S9a interface.\nThe complete specification of the BPCF is defined in BBF TR-134 [31] and BBF TR-203 [30] and BBF TR-291 [33] and it is out of the scope of 3GPP.\nThe information contained in a PCC Rule generated by the PCRF for NSWO traffic includes Service Data Flow Detection and Policy Control information elements specified in table 6.3. The PCC rules for NSWO traffic do not include the Charging and Usage Monitoring Control elements specified in table 6.3.\nFor Fixed Broadband Access the event triggers in table P.5.1-1 shall apply in addition to the ones in table 6.2.\nTable P.5.1-1: Fixed Broadband specific event triggers\nEvent trigger\nDescription\nReported from\nConditions for reporting\nUE local IP address change\nEither the UE local IP address or the UDP port number or both assigned by Fixed Broadband Access have changed\nPCEF, BBERF\nAlways set\nH(e)NB local IP address change\nEither the H(e)NB IP address or the UDP port number or both assigned by Fixed Broadband Access have changed\nPCEF, BBERF\nPCRF\nP.5.1.1\tBinding Mechanism\nP.5.1.1.1\tEPC-routed traffic\nFor EPC routed traffic, binding mechanisms apply as defined in clause 6.1.1 by PCRF, PCEF and BBERF. In addition, the PCC and QoS Rule generation is performed by PCRF as specified in clause 6.1.1, in addition when:\n-\tBoth a Gx and associated Gateway Control Session exist for the same IP-CAN session; the PCRF shall generate QoS Rules for all the authorized PCC rules in this step.\nP.5.1.1.2\tNon-seamless WLAN offloaded traffic\nThe binding mechanism includes two steps for the non-seamless WLAN offloaded traffic:\n1.\tSession binding.\n2.\tPCC rule authorization.\nFor NSWO traffic, session binding of AF session and TDF session (in unsolicited mode) to an IP-CAN session is performed by the PCRF, as defined in clause 6.1.1, for the purpose of policy control in the BBF domain.\nThe PCRF derives and authorises PCC rules as described in clause 6.1.1.\nP.5.1.2\tS9a, Gx and S15 Session Linking\nFor WLAN, PCRF and BPCF both need to support session linking function. Depending on the deployment there may be one or multiple PCRF that have a Gateway Control Session on S9a for a given UE. The PCRF shall be able to perform the linking between IP-CAN sessions on Gx and the Gateway Control Session on S9a for the same UE based on IMSI and UE local IP address.\nFor H(e)NB scenarios a Gateway Control Session on S9a may be linked to:\n-\tIP-CAN Sessions on Gx for all UEs connected to the H(e)NB;\n-\tGateway Control Sessions on S9 and/or IP-CAN Sessions on S9 (in roaming cases);\n-\tS15 Session;\nNOTE 1:\tThere is a single S15 session per HNB for CS calls for all UEs connected to the HNB in order to improve performance. In addition, for CS calls there are no UE specific policies and therefore a single PCRF can handle CS calls for all UEs.\nWhen the Gateway Control Session on S9a is initiated by PCRF, BPCF is expected to associate the session on R with the Gateway Control Session on S9a.\nNOTE 2:\tHow the BPCF performs the association of a Gateway Control Session on S9a and R session is out of the scope of 3GPP.\nP.6\tFunctional Entities\nP.6.1\tPolicy Control and Charging Rules Function (PCRF)\nP.6.1.1\tGeneral\nThe PCRF functionality defined in clause 6.2.1.0 shall apply. In addition, to support interworking with Fixed Broadband networks, the PCRF shall:\n-\tSend the QoS rules to the BPCF over S9a to request admission control in the fixed access.\n-\tSend to the BPCF the UE local IP address and UDP port number for the WLAN scenario to allow the Fixed Broadband Access to identify UE traffic.\n-\tSend to the BPCF the HeNB Local IP address and UDP port number for the Femto scenario. This allows the Fixed Broadband Access to identify IP flows corresponding to the IPSec tunnel from the HeNB GW to the SeGW which transports H(e)NB UE traffic.\n-\tBe able to be configured with the relation of IP address ranges to Fixed Broadband Access, to allow BPCF discovery.\n-\tBe able to receive from PDN GW the H(e)NB Local IP address and the UDP source port, if available, in the Fixed Broadband access network at which the H(e)NB is connected.\n-\tBe able to receive the UE local IP address and UDP source port from the ePDG (case 2a and case 2b) and PDN GW (case 1).\n-\tBe able to receive the HNB local IP address and UDP source port from HNB GW (case 1) for the HNB CS scenario.\nWhen PCRF receives the IP-CAN session establishment indication for a PDN connection initiated for a UE connected via Fixed network access, the PCRF determines if a Gateway control session is already present for this IP-CAN session. If Gateway control session is not already established, the PCRF shall trigger Gateway control session establishment procedure from the BPCF.\nWhen the UE is connecting via Fixed Broadband access network, no QoS Rules should be sent to the ePDG. The PCRF identifies when the UE is connecting via Fixed Broadband access network from the IP-CAN type.\nFor the purpose of the policy control in the Fixed Broadband Access network for the non-seamless WLAN offloaded traffic, the PCRF shall:\n-\tHandle incoming request of IP-CAN session establishment received over S9a.\n-\tPerform session binding of the AF session information received via Rx or via S9a with an existing IP-CAN session using the UE local IP address and the IMSI (if available).\n-\tInitiate IP-CAN Session Modification and also QoS information provision for Non-seamless WLAN offloaded traffic.\n-\tEstablish an Sd session with the TDF when an indication of IP-CAN session establishment is received over S9a for the UE local IP address in case of architecture variant C the solicited mode.\nP.6.1.2\tV-PCRF\nThe V‑PCRF functionality defined in clause 6.2.1.3 shall apply. For the purpose of Fixed Access interworking the V‑PCRF functionalities for EPC routed traffic, the following are applicable:\n-\tIf a BPCF-Initiated Gateway Control Session termination is received over S9a, then the V-PCRF shall terminate a Gateway Control session over S9 with the H-PCRF.\n-\tFor home routed roaming case, in case 1:\n-\tIf a Gateway Control Session termination indication is received over S9 from the H-PCRF, then the V-PCRF shall trigger a Gateway Control Session termination to the BPCF.\n-\tIf a Gateway Control and QoS Rules Request is received over S9 from the H-PCRF, then the V-PCRF shall trigger a Gateway Control and QoS Rules Request to the BPCF.\n-\tFor both home routed and visited access roaming cases, in case 2b:\n-\tIf a Gateway Control Session establishment from the BBERF (ePDG) occurs, then the V-PCRF shall establish a Gateway Control Session with the BPCF over S9a and with the H-PCRF over S9.\n-\tIf the last Gateway Control Session from the BBERF (ePDG) is terminated, then the V-PCRF shall terminate the Gateway Control Session with the BPCF over S9a and with the H-PCRF over S9.\n-\tWhen the last PDN connection over the HNB has been terminated the V-PCRF initiates the GW Control Session Termination to the BPCF if there is no S15 session bound to the Gateway control session over S9a interface session. Otherwise, if there is a S15 session bound to the Gateway control session over S9a interface session the V-PCRF initiates the GW Control QoS rule Provision procedure to the BPCF to release the resources in the fixed broadband network.\nWhen the V-PCRF receives the Gateway Control Session establishment indication for a PDN connection initiated for a UE connected via Fixed network access, the V-PCRF determines if a Gateway Control Session is already present for this IP-CAN session. If a Gateway Control Session is not already established, the V-PCRF shall trigger a Gateway Control Session establishment procedure from the BPCF.\nFor the purpose of BBF interworking for NSWO traffic, the V-PCRF functionalities described in the following are applicable:\n-\tFor roaming scenario, V-PCRF shall handle incoming request of IP‑CAN session establishment received over S9a.\n-\tIf an IP‑CAN session establishment request is received for a roaming user over the S9a reference point, then the V PCRF shall conclude that the IP‑CAN session is used for NSWO and acts as visited access network as described in clause 6.2.1.3.3.\nP.6.1.3\tH-PCRF\nThe H-PCRF functionality defined in clause 6.2.1.4 shall apply. For the purpose of Fixed Access interworking, the H‑PCRF functionalities defined in the following are applicable to the home routed scenario:\n-\tFor case 1, if an IP-CAN Session Establishment indication is received over Gx, then if this is the first IP-CAN session for this UE the H-PCRF shall establish a Gateway Control Session to the V-PCRF over S9.\n-\tFor case 1, if an IP-CAN Session Termination indication is received over Gx then if this is the last IP-CAN session for this UE, the H-PCRF shall terminate the Gateway Control session to the V-PCRF over S9.\n-\tIf a PCC Rule is generated, the H-PCRF shall send QoS rules to the V-PCRF to request admission control over S9.\n-\tIf a PCEF-Initiated IP-CAN Session Modification Procedure occurs over Gx to update, for WLAN scenario, the UE local IP Address and UDP port number, or, for the HeNB scenario, the HeNB local IP Address and UDP port number, then the H-PCRF shall send them to the V-PCRF.\n-\tFor the purpose of BBF interworking for NSWO traffic, in case of roaming, the H-PCRF shall determine PCC rules based on home operator policy for the specific UE when it receives the IP‑CAN session establishment request from V-PCRF.\nP.6.2\tBroadband Policy Control Function (BPCF)\nThe BPCF is the policy Control entity in the Fixed Broadband Access network. The complete specification of the BPCF is defined in BBF TR-134 [31] and BBF TR-203 [30] and it is out of the scope of the 3GPP.\nFor the purpose of interworking with 3GPP network the BPCF is expected to:\n-\tPerform admission control in fixed access or delegates admission control decision to other BBF nodes. Based on the admission control, the BPCF accepts or rejects the request received from PCRF over S9a.

This procedure is the same as described in clause 7.2 with the exceptions described in this clause.\nNOTE 1:\tWhen PCRF receives the IP-CAN session establishment indication over Gx interface, PCRF determines if a Gateway Control session is already present for this IP-CAN session. If a Gateway Control session is not already established, the PCRF shall trigger a Gateway Control session establishment procedure from the BPCF.\nP.7.2.1\tIP-CAN Session Establishment\nFigure P.7.2.1: IP-CAN Session Establishment for both EPC routed and NSWO traffic\nThis procedure is the same as described in clause 7.2 with the additions described below:\n1.\tThe BBF access network may become aware of the IMSI of the 3GPP UE if 3GPP-based access authentication (EAP-AKA/AKA') is performed. The BPCF also becomes aware of the UE local IP address.\nThe steps from 2 to 7 show PCC signalling to provision PCC rules and ADC rules for NSWO traffic.\n2.\tThe BPCF Initiates a IP-CAN session establishment over S9a to the PCRF for non-roaming and to the V-PCRF for roaming cases, the information contained in the request message includes IMSI, IP-CAN type, local UE IP address and the NSWO-APN. Triggered by the IP-CAN session establishment over S9 the V-PCRF triggers the S9 session establishment to the H-PCRF.\n3-4.\tThe PCRF retrieves user profile from SPR as described in clause 7.2. As part of the user profile, the PCRF may receive an indication on whether policy control for NSWO traffic should be performed for that UE.\n5.\tThe PCRF enables policy control for NSWO traffic for that UE based on operator policies and user profile information that may depend on e.g. network where the UE is offloading. The PCRF sends a reply message containing PCC Rules if policy control is enabled .\n6.\tTriggered by the successful establishment of the IP-CAN session for the UE local IP address in step 3, the V‑PCRF (roaming) and the PCRF (non-roaming) may establish a session with the TDF to provision ADC Rules for that UE local IP address (if applicable, when solicited application reporting applies and when policy control for offloaded traffic is to be performed). The PCRF provides the TDF with the UE local IP address, the IMSI, the IP-CAN type and the NSWO-APN.\n7.\tThe TDF replies as described in the clause 7.2.\nThe steps from 6 to 10 show PCC signalling to provision policies for EPC routed traffic.\n8.\tIP-CAN session establishment as specified in clause 7.2 is performed, including the establishment of a Gateway Control session (if applicable), as specified below with the following additional information:\nIn case 2a and case 2b, the ePDG (BBERF) initiates a Gateway Control Session Establishment procedure to provide the UE local IP address and UDP port (if available) as defined in clause P.7.5.1.\nFor case 1, step 3 of clause 7.2 for WLAN scenario the PCEF includes the UE local IP address and the UDP port number (if available), while for the H(e)NB scenario the PCEF includes the H(e)NB Local IP address and the UDP port number (if available) in the Fixed Broadband Access at which the H(e)NB is connected to.\nIn case 2b, S-GW (BBERF) initiates a Gateway Control Session Establishment procedure to request QoS Rules for the H(e)NB local IP address as defined in clause P.7.5.1.\nThe PCRF determines, based on information (UE local IP address information or H(e)NB local IP address information) provided in the IP-CAN session establishment indication or Gateway Control Session establishment indication (if applicable), whether or not the user is connecting via a Fixed Broadband Access Network.\nThe steps in (A) show PCC signalling to establish a Gateway Control Session over S9a for EPC routed traffic.\nA.1.\tTriggered by the IP-CAN session establishment indication, or triggered by Gateway control session establishment over Gxb*, the PCRF (non-roaming case) or the V-PCRF (visited access roaming case) initiates Gateway Control Session establishment with the BPCF over S9a, if no Gateway Control Session exists for the same IMSI for WLAN scenario. The PCRF includes in the request message to BPCF the IMSI, the UE local IP address and the UDP port number (if available), QoS Rules, and the ePDG IP address (for S2b-GTP access) or PDN GW IP address (for trusted S2c access), while for the H(e)NB scenario, the PCRF (Non-roaming case) or the V-PCRF (visited access roaming case) initiates Gateway Control Session establishment with the BPCF over S9a, if no Gateway Control Session exists for the same H(e)NB including the IMSI, H(e)NB Local IP address, the UDP port number (if available) and QoS Rules. For home routed, the H-PCRF initiates a Gateway Control Session over S9 to trigger the V-PCRF to establish a Gateway Control Session over S9a, for visited access, the V-PCRF initiates a Gateway Control Session over S9 to H-PCRF and the Gateway Control Session over S9a to BPCF.\nA.2.\tFor WLAN scenario the BPCF Initiates the Gateway Control session establishment on S9a including in the request message the IMSI, UE Local IP address and the UDP port (if available), while for the H(e)NB scenario it includes the IMSI, H(e)NB Local IP address and the UDP port number (if available) to the PCRF.\nA.3.\tThe PCRF reply message contains the result code.\nThe steps in (B) show PCC signalling to provision QoS Rules over S9a for EPC routed traffic.\nB.1.\tTriggered by the IP-CAN session establishment indication, or triggered by Gateway control session establishment over Gxb*, the PCRF (non-roaming case) or the V-PCRF (visited access roaming case) initiates Gateway Control and QoS Rule provisioning including QoS Rules and the PDN GW IP address (for trusted S2c access and if this PDN GW IP address has not been provided before), if a Gateway Control Session exists for the same IMSI for WLAN scenario while for the H(e)NB scenario the PCRF (Non-roaming case) or the V-PCRF (visited access roaming case) initiates Gateway Control and QoS Rule provisioning, if Gateway Control Session exists for the same H(e)NB including QoS Rules.\nB.2.\tThe PCRF reply message contains the result code.\n9.\tRemaining steps of IP-CAN session establishment procedure as defined in clause 7.2 from step 6 onwards.\nP.7.2.2\tVoid\nP.7.3\tIP-CAN Session Termination\nP.7.3.1\tVoid\nP.7.3.2\tIP-CAN Session Termination\nFigure P.7.3.2: IP-CAN Session Termination for either EPC routed or NSWO traffic\nThis procedure is applicable for both WLAN and H(e)NB scenario.\nFor WLAN scenarios, this procedure is performed when the PCRF knows that the 3GPP UE released a PDN connection and request the BPCF to remove the PCC/QoS Rules associated to the terminated IP-CAN session or when the last PDN connection for that 3GPP UE is released to terminate the Gateway Control Session over S9a.\nFor H(e)NB scenarios, this procedure is performed when the PCRF knows that the last 3GPP UE connecting to the H(e)NB released its last PDN connection and request the BPCF to release the Gateway Control session over S9a or when a PDN connection is released to request the BPCF to remove the QoS Rules associated with the terminated IP‑CAN session.\nThis procedure is the same as described in clauses 7.3.1 and 7.3.2, with the new steps described below:\n1.\tThe PCEF initiates the IP-CAN session termination over Gx, as defined in the clauses 7.3.1 and 7.3.2.\n2.\tThis step is triggered by the IP-CAN session termination indication in step 3 in clauses 7.3.1 and 7.3.2, the PCRF (non-roaming case) or the H-PCRF (roaming case) initiates Gateway Control Session Termination over S9a with the BPCF if this is the last IP‑CAN session corresponding to this Gateway Control Session over S9a, or initiates Gateway Control and QoS Rule Provisioning over S9a to remove QoS Rules for the purpose to release resources in the Fixed Broadband Access.\nNOTE:\tFor case 2b, the description of the Gateway Control Session Termination procedure over Gxb* when triggered by the ePDG (BBERF) is described in clause P.7.5.2 and the description of the Gateway Control and QoS Rule request procedure when triggered by the ePDG (BBERF) is described in clause P.7.5.3.\nFor case 2a, the description of the Gateway Control Session Termination procedure over Gxb* when triggered by the PCRF is described in clause P.7.5.4.\n3.\tThe BPCF reply message contains the result code.\n4.\tRemaining steps of IP-CAN session termination as described in clause 7.3 from step 4 onwards, with the additions that in .case 2a and roaming scenario, triggered by step2, the vPCRF initiates the Gateway control session termination with the ePDG over Gxb* if the Gateway control session over S9a bound to that IMSI has been terminated.\nSteps 5, 6, 7 and 8 are triggered when the BBF access is aware that the UE is detached from BBF access. These steps are not necessarily performed at termination of the IP-CAN session but may occur at a later time.\n5.\tIf the BBF access network is aware of the UE is detached from the BBF access network, the BPCF Initiates IP-CAN session termination to the PCRF (non-roaming) and the V-PCRF (for roaming cases). Triggered by the IP-CAN session termination over S9a, the V-PCRF triggers the IP-CAN session termination over S9.\n6.\tThe PCRF reply message contains the result code for the IP-CAN session terminated.\n7.\tTriggered by step 6, the PCRF (for non-roaming case) and the V-PCRF (for roaming cases) terminates the TDF session, if exists for the UE local IP address as described in the clause 7.3.\n8.\tThe TDF replies as described in the clause 7.3.\nP.7.4\tIP-CAN Session Modification\nBoth the PCRF-initiated IP-CAN Session Modification Procedure and the PCEF-initiated IP-CAN Session Modification Procedures as described in clause 7.4 are applicable for a 3GPP UE that attaches via a Fixed Broadband Access.\nP.7.4.1\tPCEF-Initiated IP-CAN Session Modification\nFigure P.7.4.1: PCEF-initiated IP-CAN Session Modification\nThis procedure is applicable for WLAN and H(e)NB scenario. This procedure is performed when the UE Local IP address, H(e)NB Local IP address or the UDP port number is changed and/or when a request for PCC Rules is received from the PCEF.

Alternatively, the PCRF may receive the TDF address as a part of IP-CAN session signalling for NS-WLAN offloaded traffic over S9a.\nNOTE:\tIt is assumed that UL and DL traffic are routed via the same TDF.\nP.8\t3GPP HNB Procedures – CS Support\nP.8.1\tS9a CS Session Establishment\nFigure P.8.1-1: S9a CS Session Establishment\nThis procedure is applicable to HNB for QoS enforcement for CS services.\n1)\tS15 session establishment procedure is performed, which can be referred to step 4-5, clause 9.4.1, TS 23.139 [29].\n2)\tThe (v-)PCRF initiates Gateway Control Session Establishment procedure with BPCF.

Policy Counter Status (INQUOTA, OUTQUOTA) changes trigger notifications over Sy.\n-\tThe PCRF is configured with operator policies that associate the policy counter status to a policy decision e.g. block or allow a service to a QoS.\nIf PCC/ADC rules that are subject to usage monitoring have different charging keys and/or different measurement methods then to achieve a common usage report over Gy then:\n-\tA common Charging Key is used for all services that are subject to usage monitoring. The charging control information of the PCC/ADC rules includes that online charging applies, the common charging key for the service and service level reporting is activated. In addition, the measurement method is to be set to time/volume.\n-\tPolicy Counter Status values associated with the quota allocated with Service identifier is configured in the OCS. Policy Counter Status (INQUOTA, OUTQUOTA) changes trigger notifications over Sy.\n-\tThe PCRF is configured with operator policies that associate the policy counter status to a policy decision e.g. block or allow a service to a QoS.\nFigure Q.1-1: Deployment for Usage Monitoring via Online Charging System\nAnnex R (informative):Disabling/re-enabling Usage Monitoring for a PCC/ADC rule\nIf usage monitoring for a PCC/ADC rule (belonging to a usage monitoring group) needs to be disabled, one of the two ways below can be chosen to realize this feature:\n-\tThe PCRF generates a new PCC/ADC rule with the same information (apart from the PCC/ADC Rule identifier) as the existing PCC/ADC rule used to control the same traffic but without the monitoring key. The PCRF provides the new PCC/ADC rule to the PCEF/TDF and removes the existing PCC/ADC rule.\nNOTE 1:\tIt is assumed that the activation of the new PCC/ADC rule takes place at the same time as the removal of the existing PCC/ADC rule and that no other actions are triggered (e.g. with respect to charging and bearer management) beside the ones related to the disabling of usage monitoring.\n-\tThe operator selects a specific monitoring key value to be used for all PCC/ADC rules for which usage monitoring is disabled. The PCRF modifies the monitoring key of the corresponding PCC/ADC rule to this specific value. Following the PCRF instruction, the PCEF or TDF updates the monitoring key in the modified PCC/ADC rule and collects the usage information for the specific monitoring key value. The PCEF/TDF usage reports would still be received by the PCRF but could be ignored.\nNOTE 2:\tThe operator should configure the usage threshold to a sufficiently high value so that frequent usage reports are avoided.\nIf usage monitoring needs to be re-enabled for a PCC/ADC rule (i.e. usage monitoring has been disabled for this PCC/ADC rule before), one of the two ways below can be chosen to realize this feature:\n-\tThe PCRF generates a new PCC/ADC rule with the same information (apart from the PCC/ADC Rule identifier) as the existing PCC/ADC rule used to control the same traffic and adds the required monitoring key. The PCRF provides the new PCC/ADC rule to the PCEF/TDF and removes the existing PCC/ADC rule without monitoring key. The PCEF/TDF executes the operations in the same way it is described above in Note 1.\n-\tThe PCRF modifies the monitoring key of the corresponding PCC/ADC rule to the value of the required usage monitoring group (e.g. back to its original value).\nAnnex S (normative):Fixed Broadband Access\nS.1\tGeneral\nThis annex specifies the enhancement to PCC framework for supporting policy and charging control in the fixed broadband access network in the convergent scenario where a single operator is deploying both the fixed broadband access network and the Evolved Packet Core (EPC).\nThe scope of this Annex is to define requirements for the convergent scenario where the PCRF controls directly the network element(s) in the fixed broadband access without the mediation of a different policy server, such as the BPCF defined in Annex P.\nPolicy and charging control is provided for both Non-seamless WLAN offload traffic from a 3GPP UE and fixed devices.\nThe work in this annex takes the fixed broadband accesses as specified by BroadBand Forum in TR-300 [37] as a reference.\nNOTE 1:\tThis does not preclude the applicability of the solutions described in this Annex to fixed broadband accesses not defined by Broadband Forum.\nThis annex is a realization of the main specification body for the Fixed Broadband Access IP-CAN. It describes only the exceptions and additions in respect to the main specification body, therefore, if not explicitly mentioned, the main specification body is applicable.\nNOTE 2:\tSupport for MPS Services and IMS Emergency is not specified in this Release.\nS.2\tDefinitions\nThe definitions in the following are relevant for this annex only.\nUE local IP address: Defined as either the public IP address assigned to the UE by the Broadband Forum domain in the no-NAT case, or the public IP address assigned by the Broadband Forum domain to the NATed RG.\nIP-CAN session: For fixed broadband access, the IP-CAN session can also be identified primarily by an IP address(es). The term UE corresponds to the device that access the services provided by the network (i.e. either RG, or 3GPP UE or fixed end-device), the PDN identifies the IP network where the device gets IP connectivity and the UE identity information may be the IMSI, the user-name or the access line identifier (if available). In a Fixed Broadband Access an IP-CAN session corresponds to a Subscriber IP Session defined in TR-146 [36].\nNOTE:\tThe PDN connection concept and APN are not applicable to Subscriber IP session for fixed device.\nS.3\tHigh Level Requirements\nS.3.0\tGeneral\nThe same requirements as defined in clause 4 4 to support usage monitoring and clause 4.5 to support application detection and control applies.\nS.3.1\tGeneral Requirements\nThe same requirements as defined in clause 4 applies with the following exception and addition:\n-\tFor Fixed devices the policy and charging control shall be possible only in non- roaming scenario.\n-\tFor Fixed Broadband Access, PCC decisions shall be based on subscription information for both fixed device and/or fixed access line.\n-\tPCRF shall control directly the PCEF in the IP-Edge in the fixed broadband access without the mediation of the BPCF defined in TS 23.139 [29].\nNOTE 1:\tIn this Release of the specification, Policy and charging control for layer 2 sessions are out of the scope.\n-\tAn IP-CAN session shall be established on the IP-Edge per IPv4 address and/or IPv6 address or IPv6 prefix known in the IP-Edge.\nPCC shall be supported for both the IP-CAN session established for the RG and for each IP-CAN session created for every device (i.e. fixed device or 3GPP UE) behind the RG that is visible in the IP-Edge/PCEF.\nNOTE 2.\tIn this Release the identification of end-user devices behind a RG configured in routed mode is not supported.\nNOTE 3:\tIn this Release of the specification, there is no support for IMS-based emergency services.\nNOTE 4:\tIn this Release of the specification, there is no support for traffic steering control.\nS.3.2\tCharging Related Requirements\nThe same requirements as defined in clauses 4.2.1, 4.2.2 and 4.2.2.a apply, with the exception and addition listed in the following:\n-\tThe architecture shall provide charging for traffic exchanged by fixed devices and NSWO traffic to/from 3GPP UEs in the following scenarios:\n-\t3GPP IP-Edge based charging with PCEF located in the fixed broadband access network;\n-\tTraffic Detection Function (TDF)-based charging;\n-\tAAA-based charging,\n-\tThe requirements for the AAA-based charging solution are described in clause S.8.\nNOTE 1:\tThe selection of which accounting methods enabled is based on deployment option and there is no dynamic capability negotiation.\nNOTE  2:\tThe same accounting method is applicable to all devices connected to the same fixed broadband access network.\nCharging interaction per device (i.e. fixed device or 3GPP UE) is possible only when an IP-CAN session exists for the 3GPP UE or fixed device connected behind a RG.\nNOTE 3:\tFor a 3GPP UE or a fixed device behind a NATed RG it is not possible to perform charging for that specific device.\nInter operator settlements are assumed to ensure support of the case of an UE receiving NSWO over a Fixed Broadband Access (FBA), when the HPLMN and the FBA Service Provider support different charging options.\nIt shall be possible for the charging system to select the applicable rate based on:\n-\thome/visited IP‑CAN;\n-\tQoS provided for the service;\n-\tTime of day;\n-\tLocation of the subscriber.\n-\tSubscriber identifier.\nHome/visited IP-CAN is not applicable for charging of fixed devices.\nS.3.3\tPolicy Control Requirements\nThe same requirements as defined in clause 4.3 applies with the exception and addition listed below:\n-\tThe PCEF in the IP-Edge shall be able to enforce policies and to perform the appropriate mapping from QoS parameters it receives from the PCRF to Broadband Forum specific parameters.\nNOTE:\tHow the IP-Edge performs such mapping is out of 3GPP scope.\n-\tPCC shall provide QoS control on a service data flow/detected application traffic basis, for IP traffic exchanged by fixed devices and for NSWO traffic exchange by 3GPP UEs in the fixed broadband access.\n-\tRequirements for QoS control at IP-CAN bearer level defined in clause 4.3.3.2 are not applicable for Fixed Broadband Access.\nS.4\tArchitecture model and reference points\nS.4.1\tReference architecture\nS.4.1.1\tGeneral\nThe reference architecture described in clause 5.1 and shown in figures S.4.1.2-1 and S.4.1.3-1 applies with the exception and addition listed in the following:\n-\tPCEF resides in the IP-Edge in the Broadband Forum access network;\n-\tGxx reference point is not used.\nNOTE 1:\tEither SPR or UDR is used in this architecture.\nNOTE 2:\tThe roaming scenario is not applicable to fixed device and RG.\nS.4.1.2\tReference architecture - Non-Roaming\nFigure S.4.1.2-1: PCC Reference architecture for Fixed Broadband Access convergence when SPR is used\nS.4.1.3\tReference architecture - Roaming\nFigure S.4.1.3-1: PCC Reference architecture for Fixed Broadband Access convergence (roaming) when SPR is used\nS.4.2\tReference points\nS.4.2.1\tGx Reference Point\nThis reference point corresponds to the Gx which resides between the PCEF in the IP-Edge and the PCRF.\nThe same functionality as defined in clause 5.2.2 with the following exceptions:\n-\tNo provisioning of IP flow mobility routing information from PCEF to PCRF is performed.\n-\tNegotiation of IP‑CAN bearer establishment mode (UE-only or UE/NW) does not apply.\nIn addition, for the purpose of convergence between 3GPP access and Broadband Forum access network, the Gx reference point enables the transfer of PCC rules for an IP-CAN session that exists in the PCEF for a fixed device or for a 3GPP UE.\nS.4.2.2\tSp Reference Point\nFor the purpose of policy and charging control convergence between 3GPP and Broadband Forum access network, the Sp reference point allows the PCRF to request subscription information from the SPR based on a subscriber ID that is defined in clause S.5.2.1. When the subscriber Id is an IMSI, the PDN identifier is the NSWO-APN. When the subscriber Id is used to identify a fixed device no PDN identifier is applicable.\nNOTE 1:\tThe naming convention of NSWO-APN is left to operator's implementation decision.\nS.4.2.3\tUd Reference Point\nFor the purpose of convergence between 3GPP access and Broadband Forum access network, the Ud reference point provides the same functionality as the Sp reference point described in clause S.4.2.2.\nS.4.2.4\tGy/Gz Reference Point\nThese reference points provide the same functionality as defined in the clauses 5.2.4 and 5.2.5 respectively.\nFor the purpose of convergence between 3GPP access and BBF access network, the functions of credit management and reporting is defined in clause S.5.1.6.\nThe Gz and Gy interfaces are specified in TS 32.240 [3] and the functionalities required across the Gz and Gy reference point are defined in TS 32.251 [9].\nS.4.2.5\tGyn/Gzn Reference Point\nThese reference points provide the same functionality as defined in the clause 5.2.10 and 5.2.11 respectively.\nIn addition for the purpose of convergence between 3GPP and BBF access network, the functions of credit management and reporting are defined in clause S.5.1.6.\nThe Gzn and Gyn interfaces are specified in TS 32.240 [3] and the functionalities required across the Gzn and Gyn reference point are defined in TS 32.251 [9].\nS.4.2.6\tSd Reference Point\nFor the purpose of convergence between 3GPP and Broadband Forum access network, the Sd reference point allows PCRF to have dynamic control over the application detection and control behaviour at a TDF for a fixed device or for a 3GPP UE. The Sd reference point enables the signalling of ADC decision, which governs the ADC behaviour. The Sd reference point provides the same functionality as the Sd described in clause 5.2.8.\nS.5\tFunctional description\nS.5.1\tOverall description\nThe purpose of PCC convergence is to enable the policy and charging control for NSWO traffic from 3GPP UE connected to the fixed broadband access network and for the traffic from fixed devices with where the PCRF controls directly the network element(s) in the fixed broadband access without the mediation of a different policy server, such as the BPCF defined in TS 23.139 [29]. In this release, EPC-routed traffic from 3GPP UE connected to connected fixed broadband access network is considered outside the scope.\nThe binding mechanism, credit management, reporting, usage monitoring, termination actions, service data flow prioritization, ADC Rule definition and operations, PCC Rule definition and operations and standardized QoS characteristics as defined in clause 6.1 shall apply.\nHandling of packet filters provided to the UE by the PCEF as defined in clause 6.1.9 is not applicable for Fixed Broadband Access.\nS.5.1.1\tIP-CAN Session\nFor routed mode RG with NAT, one IP-CAN session shall be established for each corresponding Subscriber IP session on the IP-Edge for the IPv4 address and/or IPv6 address or IPv6 prefix assigned to the RG.\nIn case of routed mode RG when the PPP pass-through feature is enabled (see requirement R-10 in TR‑124 Issue 3 [34b]) an IP-CAN session shall be established for the each single fixed device starting the PPP session. In this case the 3GPP UE does not have Subscriber IP session in IP-Edge.\nFor bridged mode RG, one IP-CAN session shall be established for each corresponding Subscriber IP session on the IP-Edge for each IPv4 address and/or IPv6 address or IPv6 prefix assigned to the fixed device or 3GPP UE which established a Subscriber IP session in fixed broadband network.\nFor routed mode RG with IPv6 when stateless IPv6 address autoconfiguration is used by the end-device behind the RG, one IP-CAN session shall be established for each corresponding Subscriber IP session on the IP-Edge for the IPv6 prefix assigned to the RG. When stateful IPv6 address configuration is used by the end-devices, one IP-CAN session may be established for each end-device.\nFor routed mode RG, the successful completion of 3GPP-based access authentication and assignment of IP address to the 3GPP UE shall not result in any IP-CAN session establishment if the IP address assignment does not result in a new Subscriber IP Session in the IP-Edge. In this case the pre-existent IP-CAN session for the RG is used.\nA device connected to the RG (e.g. VoIP phones) may also initiate a Subscriber IP session when the RG is configured in bridge mode or when the PPP pass-through feature is enabled on the Routing RG (see requirement R-10 in TR‑124 Issue 3 [34b]).\nS.5.1.2\tSubscriber Identifier\nThe Subscriber ID represents the identity of the User.\nFor the 3GPP UE the Subscriber ID is the IMSI.\nThe Subscriber ID used by fixed device at establishment of Subscriber IP session in fixed broadband access network can be the Access Line Identifier (physical and logical circuit ID) or the username, for example when the Subscriber IP session is a PPP Session. For the RG and fixed device based on Broadband Forum specification, the Subscriber ID is defined in Broadband Forum WT 134 [31] specification.\nS.5.1.3\tEvent triggers\nThe fixed broadband access network in the convergent scenario supports the Event triggering mechanisms described in clause 6.1.4. The event triggers applicable are listed in the following:\nTable S.5.1.3-1: Event triggers\nEvent trigger\nDescription\nReported from\nCondition for reporting\nQoS change\nThe QoS of the Default Access Profile in AAA has changed\nPCEF\nPCRF\nOut of credit\n(see note 1)\nCredit is no longer available.\nPCEF, TDF\nPCRF\nEnforced ADC rule request\nTDF is performing an ADC rules request as instructed by the PCRF.\nTDF\nPCRF\nUsage report\nThe IP-CAN/TDF session or the Monitoring key specific resources consumed by a UE either reached the threshold or needs to be reported for other reasons.\nPCEF, TDF\nPCRF\nStart of application traffic detection and\nStop of application traffic detection\n(see note 2)\nThe start or the stop of application traffic has been detected.\nPCEF, TDF\nPCRF\nCredit management session failure\n(see note 1)\nTransient/Permanent Failure as specified by the OCS\nPCEF, TDF\nAlways set\nNOTE 1:\tThis event may apply only when Gy and/or Gyn are deployed.\nNOTE 2:\tThis event may only be triggered by a PCEF enhanced with ADC.\nS.5.1.4\tVoid\nS.5.1.5\tVoid\nS.5.1.6\tCredit management\nFor the purpose of credit management of an IP-CAN session for a fixed devices or a 3GPP UE using NSWO, the description in clause 6.1.3 applies with the following exceptions: the subscription identity is provided by PCEF or TDF to the OCS as defined in S.5.1.2 and the applicable credit-reauthorization triggers are defined in the table S.5.1.6-1:\nTable S.5.1.6-1: Credit re-authorization triggers\nCredit re-authorization trigger\nDescription\nApplicable for\nCredit authorisation lifetime expiry\n(see note 1)\nThe OCS has limited the validity of the credit to expire at a certain time.\nPCEF, TDF\nIdle timeout\n(see note 1)\nThe service data flow identified by a PCC Rules or the application identified by an ADC Rule has been empty for a certain time.\nPCEF, TDF\nQoS changes\nThe QoS of the access network profile has changed.\nPCEF\nNOTE 1:\tThis credit reauthorization triggers apply only when Gy and/or Gyn are deployed.\nS.5.2\tPolicy and charging Control\nS.5.2.1\tPolicy and charging control rule\nThe definition of PCC rule and PCC Rule operations in clauses 6.3.1 and 6.3.2 are applicable, except:\n-\tPS to CS session continuity;\n-\tUser Location Report.\nNOTE:\tThe procedure for provisioning predefined PCC rules at the IP-Edge is out of 3GPP scope.\nS.5.2.1a\tIP‑CAN session related policy information\nTable 6.4 applies with the following exceptions:\n-\tAuthorized QoS per bearer and authorized MBR per QCI are not applicable for Fixed Broadband Access.\n-\tCharging characteristics profile for 3GPP UE is not available at the PCEF/IP-Edge.\n-\tNo Charging Characteristics profile is defined for fixed devices.\nS.5.2.2\tVoid\nS.5.3\tVoid\nS.5.4\tReflective QoS\nThe Fixed Broadband Network received the PCC rules from Gx reference point and as described in clauses S.3.3 and S.6.1.2 performs the appropriated mapping to Fixed Broadband access parameters. The mapping is outside the scope of 3GPP network and defined in TR-300 [37]. Fixed Broadband Access network currently supports the DSCP marking as specified in BBF TR-092 [40] for BRAS, in BBF TR-101 [35] for Access Nodes and Aggregation Nodes and in BBF TR-124 Issue 3 [34b] for the RG.\nThe solution is based on DSCP marking of packets traversing the Fixed Broadband Access network. The solution assumes functionality in the BBF domain, all these functions are out-of-scope for 3GPP; also, these functions may or may not be implemented depending on the agreement between 3GPP and Fixed Broadband Access operator, these functions are described for information only.\nThe downlink QoS treatment of the traffic in the PCEF is defined in clause S.6.1.2 and in TR-300 [37].\nFor the QoS treatment of the IP flow traffic from the UE to the IP-Edge, DSCP marking may be performed by the 3GPP UE by means of reflective QoS as defined in TS 23.139 [29], in particular:\n-\tHow to inform the UE, as part of 3GPP access authentication signalling, that reflective QoS shall be applied on all the traffic in the attached network as defined in clause 6.3.1 of TS 23.139 [29].\n-\tHow the UE creates a 5-tuple rule for uplink traffic as defined in clause 6.3.3 of TS 23.139 [29]. How the RG or the IP-Edge may implement protective measurements (e.g. per UE-bandwidth limitations in the RG or in the IP-Edge) as defined in clause 6.3.1 of TS 23.139 [29].\nNOTE:\tThe UE supporting reflective QoS always send this indication during the Access authentication procedure.\nS.5.5\tPolicy Control\nPolicy control functionalities listed in clause 6.1.5: binding, gating control, event reporting, QoS control and Redirection are applicable for Fixed Broadband Access. There is no support for NW initiated or UE initiated bearer establishment procedures; policy control is performed locally at the PCEF or at the TDF.\nIf the PCRF provides authorized QoS for both, the IP‑CAN session and PCC rule(s), the enforcement of authorized QoS of the individual PCC rules shall take place first.\nS.5.5.1\tDefault QoS Control\nThe BBF AAA may provide a default Access Profile QoS for the IP-CAN session that may contain QoS information.\nThe PCRF may provide dynamically the default QoS for the IP-CAN session to the PCEF over Gx or alternatively may provide a default QoS profile name for those cases when the default QoS profile is provisioned in the IP-Edge/PCEF. The PCEF enforces the default QoS or the default QoS profile for the IP-CAN session provisions over Gx. The PCEF does not enforce the default Access Profile QoS provided by BBF AAA for the IP-CAN session if PCRF is deployed.\nThe default QoS consists of a QCI and MBR.\nThe IP-Edge/PCEF shall be able to convert default QoS into Fixed Broadband Access QoS attribute values. In the IP-Edge, the QCI and optionally the ARP priority level is used to determine the DSCP code value or other transport specific information element and the MBR is used for bandwidth limitation for the DSCP code value. The PCEF/IP-Edge shall enforce first the QoS for the packets that matches a service data flow template in an installed PCC Rule for which specific QoS enforcement actions are provided then the IP-Edge/PCEF shall enforce the default QoS for all downlink and uplink traffic for the IP-CAN session.\nS.6\tFunctional Entities\nThe functional entities listed in clause 6.2 apply, except BBERF. Those functional entities that have specific values or specific functionality for Fixed Broadband Access are described in this clause.\nNOTE:\tSupport for MPS Services and IMS Emergency is not specified in this Release.\nS.6.1\tPolicy Control and Charging Rules Function (PCRF)\nS.6.1.1\tGeneral\nThe PCRF functionality defined in clause 6.2.1.0 shall apply, with the following exceptions:\n-\tNo negotiation of IP-CAN bearer establishment mode applies.\n-\tNo subscription to changes of IP-CAN type, RAT type or Access Network Information applies to the PCEF.\n-\tNo event triggers that the TDF can subscribe to need to be monitored by the PCRF.\n-\tUsage Monitoring Control as defined in clause 6.6 applies with the following exceptions:\n-\tIn the routed RG with NAT mode, the IP-CAN session is per RG in the PCEF/IP-Edge, the PCRF retrieves the usage monitoring related information from the SPR using the subscriber-id provided over Gx. The PCRF decides how to allocate a usage threshold to each existing IP-CAN session and/or MK.\n-\tIn the bridge RG mode and in routed RG mode without NAT there may be a separate fixed subscriber session (i.e. IP-CAN session) for the each device behind the RG. The PCRF retrieves usage monitoring related information from the SPR using the subscriber-id and, if the request is for a 3GPP UE, the NSWO APN provided over Gx. The PCRF decides how to allocate a usage threshold to each existing IP-CAN session and/or Monitoring Key.\nS.6.1.1.1\tInput for PCC decisions\nThe PCEF may provide a subset of the information listed in clause 6.2.1.1 with the following fixed broadband specific values:\n-\tSubscriber Identifier in the form of an IMSI, MSISDN for a 3GPP UE or in the form of a user-name or Access Line Identifier (physical and logical circuit ID) for fixed device or RG;\n-\tLocation of the subscriber; that may include Access line id (physical and logical circuit ID), SSID of the AP, BSSID of the AP;\nNOTE:\tHow the location information becomes available to the PCEF/IPEdge is out of the scope of 3GPP.\n-\tPLMN id of the PCEF located in the IPEdge, if available;\n-\tIPv4/IPv6 address or IPv6 prefix of the UE;\n-\tType of IP‑CAN (i.e. Fixed Broadband Access);\n-\tA PDN ID in the form of the NSWO-APN for a 3GPP UE.\nThe SPR may provide the information listed in clause 6.2.1.1 for a UE and optionally for NSWO-APN.\nThe OCS may provide the information listed in clause 6.2.1.1 for a UE.\nThe TDF may provide the information listed in clause 6.2.1.1 for a UE and optionally for NSWO-APN.\nThe AF, if involved, may provide the information listed in clause 6.2.1.1 with the following Fixed Broadband Access Specific values:\n-\tSubscriber Identifier;\n-\tIPv4/IPv6 address or IPv6 prefix of the UE.\nS.6.1.2\tPolicy and Charging Enforcement Function (PCEF)\nThe PCC requirements for the PCEF is located in the Fixed Broadband Access are defined in TR-300 [37]. The PCEF performs the following Fixed Broadband specific functions:\nQoS enforcement:\n-\tThe PCEF shall be able to convert a QoS parameters sent from PCRF to Fixed Broadband Access to specific QoS attribute and determine the QoS parameters sent to PCRF from the PCEF from a set of Fixed Broadband Access specific QoS attribute.\nApplication Detection:\n-\tThe support of Application Detection functionality is considered a network operator choice in Fixed Broadband Access.

For Fixed Broadband Access, the TDF does not subscribe to event triggers indication from the PCRF at any IP-CAN session procedure.\nS.7\tPCC Procedures and Flows\nS.7.1\tIntroduction\nA \"Fixed Broadband Access IP-CAN\" is a fixed access broadband network that provides IP connectivity to a UE. The Fixed Broadband Access IP-CAN reuses the definition of an IP-CAN session in this specification.\nThe AF can provide the NATed IP address and ports used by the UE (for IMS, according to TS 23.228 [39]).\nNOTE:\tWhen the above condition is not met, there are no standardized means as for now to identify a UE behind a NATed-RG.\nThe Fixed Broadband Access network does not support the concept of a bearer and multiple bearers as defined in TS 23.401 [17]. However, DSCP marking provides QoS support on transport network layer so that QoS and charging policies can be applied per SDF.\nCase 1, no Gateway Control Session applies for Fixed Broadband Access.\nThe procedures cover both non-roaming and roaming with access to NSWO APN for a 3GPP UE. For the roaming case with access to NSWO APN, the V PCRF interacts with the IP-Edge PCEF and, if Sd applies, with the TDF.\nS.7.2\tIP-CAN Session Establishment\nThe PCEF located in the IP-Edge initiates the Gx IP‑CAN Session establishment as defined in clause 7.2. The session is initiated after that the IP-Edge becomes aware of an IPv4 address and/or an IPv6 prefix has been assigned to the fixed device and/or 3GPP UE.\nIn route mode configuration with NATed RG, the session is initiated after the RG has been connected to the network and has been assigned an IPv4 address and/or IPv6 Prefix. The IPv4 address and/or IPv6 Prefix are assigned as per Broadband Forum specifications and it is out of scope of 3GPP.\nIn bridge mode, the session is initiated after the device has been authenticated has been assigned an IPv4 address and/or IPv6 address or IPv6 Prefix by the Fixed Broadband access.\nOperator policies in the PCEF indicate if dynamic policy control is provided. In addition, the NSWO-APN is also configured for subscribers on a PLMN basis.\nThe PCEF located in the IP-Edge includes in the IP‑CAN Session establishment message the Subscriber-Id, NSWO-APN if available, IP-CAN type, the Default QoS if available, the PLMN id if available and the location information as defined in S.6.1.1.1.\nThe IP-Edge maps the Default-Access-Profile QoS to Default-QoS as defined in clause S.5.5.1.\nThe PCRF may provision a Default QoS or a Default QoS profile, PCC Rules to activate and Events Triggers to report.\nS.7.3\tIP-CAN Session Termination\nThis procedure is in accordance with clause 7.3.2 with the exceptions listed in this Annex. The UE-initiated IP-CAN session termination is not to applicable to Fixed Broadband Access.\nThe IP-CAN session termination is triggered by PCEF when Subscriber IP session is terminated. The trigger to terminate the Subscriber IP session may be HSS/AAA request to detach the UE or may be Broadband Forum specific (e.g. RG switch off, loss of transmission, IP address lease expiration PPPoE session termination, etc) and out of the scope of 3GPP.\nIn routed mode configuration with NAT this procedure is applicable only when IP session from RG is terminated, e.g. when RG switches off or when public IP address assigned to the RG is released, etc.\nNOTE:\tIn routed mode with NAT, the termination of connection from a device in LAN, e.g. when device releases the local IP address or it disconnects from WLAN does not trigger the IP-CAN session termination for IP session from RG.\nS.7.4\tIP-CAN Session Modification\nS.7.4.1\tPCEF-Initiated IP-CAN Session Modification\nThis clause is related to IP-CAN session modification initiated by IP-Edge/PCEF for IP session. This procedure is in accordance with clause 7.4.1 with the exceptions listed in this Annex.\nIn routed mode with NAT, this procedure can be triggered when new device connects to the RG, for example when UE requests a local IP address to the RG or when a UE disconnects from WLAN.\nThe IP-Edge reports that an Event was met, including the Event Trigger and the affected PCC Rule. If TDF applies, the PCRF may provide ADC Rules and Event Triggers to the TDF and may provide PCC Rule, Event Triggers and a Default QoS or a Default QoS profile to PCEF.\nS.7.4.2\tPCRF-Initiated IP-CAN Session Modification\nThis procedure is in accordance with clause 7.4.2 with the exceptions listed in this Annex.\nThe PCRF may also provide a Default QoS or a Default QoS profile to PCEF.\nS.7.5\tUpdate of the subscription information in the PCRF\nThis procedure is in accordance with clause 7.5.when the UE's (i.e. RG, fixed device or 3GPP UE) profile changes.\nS.7.6\tPCRF Discovery and selection\nPCRF discovery and selection follows the principles defined in clause 7.6 with the following modification:\n-\tThe Subscriber ID specified in clause S.5.1.2 is used as user identity.\n-\tFor a 3GPP UE, the NSWO-APN is also available.\n-\tThe IPv6 address may be included in the IP-CAN session establishment in the case of bridge-mode RG.\nS.8\tCharging using AAA signalling\nThe architecture shall provide charging for traffic exchanged by fixed devices and NSWO traffic to/from 3GPP UEs using AAA signalling.\nIn this release in case of AAA-based charging the BBF AAA server is used for performing accounting of fixed device as defined by BBF specifications TR-101 [35] and TR-146 [36].\nNOTE:\tThe AAA-based accounting for fixed device is not applicable in roaming scenario.\nFor the charging session over Gya and Gza, the user identifier is the same that is issued over the Gx session\nS.8.1\tReference architecture - Non-Roaming\nFigure S.8.1: PCC Reference architecture for Fixed Broadband Access convergence when AAA-based accounting is used\nS.8.2\tReference architecture - Roaming\nFigure S.8.2: PCC Reference architecture for Fixed Broadband Access convergence (roaming) when AAA-based accounting is used\nS.8.3\tGza Reference Point\nTo transport charging information about 3GPP UE, the Gza reference point is located between Accounting Interworking function in the BBF defined network and the 3GPP offline charging system OFCS located in the VPLMN (roaming scenario) or in the HPLMN (non-roaming scenario).\nTo transport charging information about fixed devices, the Gza reference point is located between the Accounting Interworking function in the BBF defined network and the 3GPP offline charging system located in the HPLMN (only non-roaming scenario).\nNOTE:\tThe detailed definition of Gza reference point and diagram flows for supporting AAA-based charging is outside the scope of this specification. See SA WG5 specifications for further details.\nS.8.4\tGya Reference Point\nThe Gya reference point is located between the Accounting Interworking function in the BBF defined Access Network and the 3GPP online charging system OCS located in the HPLMN and it transports charging information for 3GPP UE.\nThe Gya reference point is located between the Accounting Interworking function in the BBF defined Access Network and the 3GPP online charging system located in the HPLMN and it transports charging information for fixed device.\nNOTE:\tThe definition of Gya reference point and diagram flows for supporting AAA-based charging is outside the scope of this specification. See SA WG5 specifications for further details.\nS.8.5\tB Reference Point\nThis reference point is defined in BBF TR-300 [37].\nNOTE:\tThe definition of this reference point is out of the scope of 3GPP.\nS.8.6\tAAA based charging\nThe charging support for NSWO traffic for 3GPP UE and fixed devices can be provided when the BBF network reports per-user accounting data via B and Gya/Gza reference points.\nOffline and online charging may be supported by the 3GPP and BBF domain. In this Release, in case of AAA-based charging, the Online charging is supported based on existing capability supported by B reference point and IP-Edge with limitation based on AAA RADIUS/Diameter accounting in the BBF network (e.g. BNG capability, usage of RADIUS over B reference point).\nFor RG in routed mode configuration with NAT, the single devices (i.e. fixed device and 3GPP UE) connected behind a RG can not be recognised, so the accounting is performed only for the RG.\nIn case of RG bridge mode configuration and in routed mode configuration without NAT the AAA based charging is performed per single devices having a Subscriber IP session.\nIn order to allow performing charging for fixed devices, the following assumptions are made about functionality in the Fixed Broadband Network:\n-\tThe BBF network is able to collect per user accounting data for fixed devices and periodically report this data via the B reference point.\nS.8.7\tAccounting Interworking Function\nThe Accounting Interworking Function that performs translation of the accounting signalling and parameters that are understood by the IP-Edge into the credit management signalling and parameters that are understood by the OCS and the OFCS is defined in BBF TR-300 [37].\nS.8.8\tProcedures AAA based charging using accounting signalling\nS.8.8.0\tGeneral\nThis clause describes the AAA-based charging. The basic assumption is that B interface is not modified.\nS.8.8.1\tCharging Session Initiation\nThis procedure is performed for initiation of charging session\nFigure S.8.8.1: AAA-based Charging Session Initiation\nThe steps included in Block A and B are mutually exclusive.\n1.\tThe 3GPP UE EAP-based authentication or BBF Fixed device authentication is performed.\nNOTE 1:\tAuthentication for fixed device is out of the scope of 3GPP specifications.\nA.1\tIf AAA-based accounting applies, the 3GPP UE/BBF device is successfully authenticated and this triggers the interaction with the OCS system. This step is outside the 3GPP scope.\nA.2.\tThe Accounting Interworking Function that will activate the online-charging session, and provide relevant input information for the OCS decision. i.e. subscriber identifier and charging keys obtained in step A.1.\nA.3.\tIf online charging is applicable, the OCS provides the possible credit information to the Accounting Interworking Function and may provide re-authorisation triggers for each of the credits.\nNOTE 2:\tThe Only Credit Reauthorization triggers that can be reported are \"Credit Reauthorization time expired\".\n2.\tIf PCC is supported, the IP-CAN session establishment procedure may be established as define in clause S.7.2. The steps from 1 to 14 defined in clause 7.2 are performed with the following exception:\n-\tSteps 9 - 10 are performed only if TDF based accounting is supported and AAA-based accounting is not supported.\n-\tSteps 13 - 14 are performed only if PCEF accounting is supported and AAA-based accounting is not supported.\nB.1.\tIf AAA-based accounting applies, the start of accounting session is triggered in BBF AAA. This step is out of the scope of 3GPP specifications.\nNOTE 3:\tThis step may occur anytime in parallel to steps from 1 to 14 of clause 7.2\nB.2.\tThe same step as step A.1\nB.3.\tThe same step as step A.2\n3\tThe IP-CAN session establishment as defined in clause 7.2 steps from 15 to 17 are performed.\nS.8.8.2\tCharging Session Modification\nThis procedure is performed for updating the charging information, such as the available quota.\nFigure S.8.8.2: AAA-based Charging Session modification\n1.\tThe BNG can sent a RADIUS-Start accounting message or a RADIUS-Intermediate-Accounting message.\n2\tWhen the Accounting Interworking Function receives the message, it determines if it is required to update the accounting information which triggers an interaction with the OCS.\n3.\tThe Accounting Interworking Function may contact the OCS to request credit for new charging keys and/or to issue final report and return remaining credit for charging keys no longer active, i.e. when the accounting session is terminated.\n4.\tThe OCS may instruct the Accounting Interworking Function on the further handling of the session (terminate, continue, etc), provide credit information (possibly with re-authorisation trigger), and/or acknowledge the credit report.\nS.8.8.3\tCharging Session Termination\nS.8.8.3.1\tCharging Session Termination BNG-initiated\nThis procedure is performed when BNG send a stop accounting message to the Accounting Interworking Function, for example the IP-CAN session termination procedure is initiated by PCRF or when Subscriber IP session terminated (for example when the 3GPP UE disassociates from the fixed broadband network, the RG is switched off, etc.).\nFigure S.8.8.3.1-1: AAA-based Charging Session Termination\n1.\tThe BNG determines that the Subscriber IP session is terminated (e.g. the device has left the fixed broadband network) and consequently a PCEF-Initiated IP-CAN session termination is initiated or it shall be terminated, when PCRF-Initiated IP-CAN session termination procedure is performed.\n2.\tThe BNG send a RADIUS-Stop-accounting message to the ACC_If. This step is outside the scope of 3GPP specifications.\n3\tThe Accounting Interworking Function determines that the Accounting Session shall be terminated.\n4.\tThe Accounting Interworking Function shall issue the final reports and return the remaining credit to the OCS.\n5.\tThe OCS acknowledges the credit report and terminates the online charging session.\nAnnex T (informative):How to accumulate PCC/ADC Rule usage in multiple monitoring groups\nIf usage for a PCC/ADC rule is accumulated in multiple Monitoring Groups, the following solution re-uses the capabilities defined in the main body of this specification, the steps are described below:\n1.\tThe PCRF retrieves the total group allowance for the Monitoring Group and the set of services belonging to the Monitoring Group from the SPR.\n2.\tFor dynamic PCC/ADC Rules, the PCRF selects a Monitoring Key for those services that belongs to more than one Monitoring Group but does not have an individual Monitoring Key assigned.\n3.\tFor pre-configured PCC/ADC Rules the PCRF selects the PCC/ADC Rules for each of the services that belong to the monitoring group. For pre-configured PCC/ADC Rules, the PCEF is configured with an individual Monitoring Key that monitors the usage.\n4.\tThe PCRF calculates a usage threshold for each of these Monitoring Keys taking into account the minimum of the individual service allowance and the monitoring group allowance(s) the service belongs to.\n5.\tThe PCRF installs or activates the PCC/ADC Rule. The PCRF provides a usage threshold for each Monitoring Key.\n6.\tWhen the PCRF receives a usage report for a Monitoring Key from the requested node (PCEF or TDF), the PCRF shall deduct the value from the corresponding group allowances and from the individual allowance if needed.\n7.\tAs long as all group usage allowances are not reached, the PCRF calculates a new usage threshold for the Monitoring Key based on the corresponding group allowances the service belongs to.\nAnnex U (normative):Policy and charging control in the downlink direction for traffic marked with DSCP by the TDF\nIn order to provide policy and charging control (e.g. QoS enforcement) in the downlink direction for applications with non-deducible service data flows detected by the TDF, in addition to the solution described in clause 4.5, the following solution is defined:\nThe TDF shall be able to mark detected downlink application traffic with a DSCP value received within an installed ADC Rule matching this traffic.\nNOTE 1:\tUnless a class of applications matches the definition of a DSCP value standardised by IETF, DSCP values with no standardised meaning in IETF are used. DSCP values in ranges reserved by IANA for \"experimental or Local Use\" are suitable.\nNOTE 2:\tUsing DSCP values with no standardised meaning in IETF prevents any IP router between TDF and PCEF to perform differentiated service scheduling for related IP packets unless it is updated or configured to support those DSCP values. This implies that sufficient network capacity must be guaranteed along the path between the TDF and PCEF so that the disabling of DiffServ packet forwarding has no detrimental impact on the end-to-end QoS.\nNOTE 3:\tMarking of DSCP bits for this purpose can interfere with appropriate traffic handling in some operator transport networks. The DSCP marking may also get remarked by routing entities within the operator networks.\nNOTE 4:\tIf the application sets DSCP marking that is used for policy and charging control in the PCEF, either no ADC Rule is installed in the TDF matching this application traffic or if an ADC Rule is installed, then DSCP marking is not enabled. When TDF sets DSCP to values used for policy and charging control, network configuration needs to prevent an untrusted source from getting unplanned QoS and charging and also prevent remapping of this traffic between the application and the TDF.\nTo ensure that the DSCP value used for service data flow detection is not visible to the operator's transport network, based on operator configuration, a tunnelling protocol may be used between TDF and PCEF.\nIn case tunnelling is used then the DSCP value used for service data flow detection shall be carried in the inner IP header. The DSCP marking used in the operator's transport network is carried in the outer IP header of the tunnel.\nNOTE 5:\tThe tunnel connections are preconfigured in the IP infrastructure connecting the TDF and the PCEF. The operator needs to ensure the same tunnel configuration is used for the TDF and for the PCEF. The tunnel protocol can be any applicable IP-based tunnel depending on operator´s choice.\nIn order to support policy and charging control in the downlink direction by the PCEF/BBERF for an application detected by the TDF (typically for services with non -deducible service data flows), the PCRF shall either install a dynamic PCC/QoS Rule or activate a pre-defined PCC rule, which identifies traffic based on the corresponding DSCP value (provided by the ToS/Traffic Class mask field within the service data flow filter). In case tunnelling is used, the PCEF shall use the inner header's DSCP for the service data flow detection defined in clause 6.2.2.2.\nNOTE 6:\tThis solution is particularly useful for QoS enforcement in the downlink direction procedures performed by the PCEF/BBERF. The TDF may still perform application detection and control as per received ADC Rules, including application detection reporting to the PCRF, enforcement control, usage monitoring control and charging, while applying DSCP marking. The PCEF/BBERF may also perform then policy and charging control in the downlink direction.\nAnnex V (informative):Policy Control for Remote UEs behind a ProSe UE-to-Network Relay UE\nWith the Proximity-based services, in accordance with TS 23.303 [44], a UE acting as a Remote UE can connect to a PDN via a ProSe UE-to-Network Relay UE, using an IP-CAN session that the Relay UE has established.\nThe Relay UE is assigned an IPv6 prefix that is shorter than /64.\nThe PCRF does not get any Remote UE identity and is not required to be aware of the Remote UE but is expected to validate Remote UE related service information from the AF and generate any necessary PCC rules according to standard procedures already defined. PCC rule authorizations may be static (e.g. predefined PCC rules) or rely on AF provided service information.\nAn AF serving a remote UE reaches the appropriate PCRF based on the IPv6 prefix that the UE-to-Network Relay UE has assigned to the remote UE. The AF reaches the appropriate PCRF by performing a PLMN lookup for the IPv6 prefix and using the Network Realm/Domain, as defined in TS 23.003 [16], associated with the PLMN.\nIn order to make a PCC rule specific for a certain Remote UE, the SDF filters used for traffic detection need to include the attribute Local Address and Mask with a value that corresponds to the Remote UE only. The value is normally an IPv6 prefix that is longer than the prefix assigned for the IP-CAN session (i.e. for the ProSe UE-to-Network Relay UE).\nAnnex W (informative):Void\nAnnex X (informative):Encrypted traffic detection by using domain name matching\nFor the cases when it is required to detect and enforce/charge sponsored services within encrypted traffic, and those sponsored services are uniquely identifiable by a list of {IP address ranges, domain name matching strings, match type (absolute/suffix)} set, while either element in the pair of {IP address ranges, domain name matching strings} can be \"any\", as applicable, but not both elements simultaneously, the domain name matching solution described below may be used.\nNOTE 1:\tL3 information (IP address ranges) is visible even if traffic is encrypted.\nThe following assumptions apply for the solution:\n-\tThere exists an agreement between the operator and sponsored data connectivity content provider.\n-\tContent provider uses HTTPS as a transport mechanism, using Web Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).\nThe set of information {IP address ranges, domain name matching strings, match type (absolute/suffix)} required to identify encrypted traffic is defined in the PCEF/TDF either by using pre-defined PCC/ADC Rules or by using dynamic PCC/ADC Rules that include Application Identifiers, as applicable. The detection logic to which Application Identifier in the PCEF/TDF refers to, is extended to cover ({IP address ranges, domain name matching strings, match type (absolute/suffix)} information. If such a pre-defined or dynamic PCC/ADC Rule is active for an IP-CAN/TDF session, the PCEF/TDF shall check IP address ranges, and, in case of compliancy with the received/preconfigured value (see note 2), match domain name strings, either absolutely or by suffix, against the following fields in the initial HTTPS handshake:\n-\tTLS Server Name Indication (SNI) extension, when available (see [47]); or, if not available.\n-\tServer certificate's Subject Alternative Name x.509 extension DNS name, when available. All relevant values shall be examined for matching; or if not available or no match was found.\n-\tServer certificate's Subject Common Name (CN).\nNOTE 2:\tIf the IP address ranges equals \"Any\", then any traffic is said to be compliant.\nThe information required for the detection of sponsored HTTPS (i.e. defined in Annex X to be pre-configured in the PCEF/TDF and either the TLS SNI extension or the Server certificate´s Subject Alternative Name x.509 DNS name or Server certificate´s Subject CN) is verified with the corresponding server IP address/prefix of the IP packets by the PCEF/TDF. The PCEF/TDF uses implementation specific logic to perform this verification.\nAnnex Y (informative):Change history\nChange history\nDate\nMeeting\nTDoc\nCR\nRev\nCat\nSubject/Comment\nNew
