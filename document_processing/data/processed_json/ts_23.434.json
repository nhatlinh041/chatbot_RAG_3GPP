For this usage the SEAL-E reference point shall use the LWP-1 and either the LWP-2 or the LWP-3 reference point depending on the trust relationship between the interacting SEAL servers.",

The group management server stores the mapping between the VAL group ID and the external Group Id in the VAL group document, along with a list of GPSIs corresponding to the identity list provided by the VAL server. The group management server also determines whether the group is for 5G LAN-Type communication and whether Ethernet or IP (IPv4 and/or IPv6) transport shall be used for the 5G LAN-Type communication.\n4.\tIf 5G LAN-Type communication is to be used, the group management server creates a 5GVN group in the 5GS via N33 using the create group procedure specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [10] clause 5.29.2 and 3GPP TS 23.502 [11] clause 4.15.6. The group management server creates the 5GVN group data and the 5GVN group membership data defined in 3GPP TS 23.502 [11] clause 4.15.6.3b to be configured in the 5GS. To create the 5GVN group data the group management server uses the 5G LAN-Type communication type information provided by the VAL server to set the PDU session type (Ethernet or IP) and maps the VAL service IDs to Application descriptors. To create the 5GVN group membership data the group management server maps the VAL group ID to the External Group ID and makes a list of GPSIs corresponding to the identity list provided by the VAL server.\nNOTE 1:\tThis step is skipped for the case that a 5G LAN-Type communication is not being used.\nNOTE 2:\tThe PDU session type, DNN, S-NSSAI provided within 5GVN group data cannot be modified in the 5GS after the create procedure.\nNOTE 3:\tThe 5GS supports only a 1:1 mapping between DNN/S-NSSAI combination and 5GVN group.\nNOTE 4:\tThe group management server maintains a mapping between DNN and S-NSSAI of the 5GVN group and the VAL server requester identity based on operator policy. How such mapping is configured is implementation specific and out of the scope of this specification.\n5.\tThe group management server announces the VAL group to the group management clients. For a 5GVN group the announcement includes the communication type (IP or Ethernet), DNN, and S-NSSAI corresponding to the 5GVN group.\n6.\tThe group management client registers to VAL group communication using the VAL Group ID.\n7.\tThe group management server records the users who have registered to be the members of the group.\n8.\tThe group management server sends a VAL group registration response to the group management client.\n9.\tThe group management server sends a configure VAL group response to the VAL server.\nNOTE 5:\tStep 9 may occur any time after step 5.\n10.\tThe group management server sends identity list notification about the newly registered users to the other members of the group and VAL server, whose subscription to receive notifications of newly registered VAL UE IDs is successful in step 8 and step 9 respectively.\n11.\tThe group management client may inform VAL client about the updated identity list.",

The network resource management server communicates with the SCEF via T8 reference point or communicates with the NEF via N33 reference point to perform event monitoring procedures from the underlying 3GPP network system. The network resource management server interacts with NEF via N33 to obtain QoS monitoring information from the 5GS.\nFigure 14.2.2.1-2 exhibits the service-based interfaces for providing and consuming group management services. The network resource management server could provide service to VAL server and network resource management client through interface Snrm.\nFigure 14.2.2.1-2: Architecture for network resource management – Service based representation\nFigure 14.2.2.1-3 illustrates the service-based representation for utilization of the 5GS network services based on the 5GS SBA specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [10].\nFigure 14.2.2.1-3: Architecture for network resource management utilizing the 5GS network services based on the 5GS SBA – Service based representation\nFigure 14.2.2.1-4 illustrates the service-based representation for utilization of the Core Network northbound APIs via CAPIF.\nFigure 14.2.2.1-4: Utilization of Core Network Northbound APIs via CAPIF – service based representation\nThe Network resource management server and VAL server act as authorized API invoker to consume services from the Core Network northbound API entities like NEF which act as API Exposing Function as specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [6].",

The architecture for the 5G TSC is depicted in Figure 14.2.2.3-1. The SEAL NRM server acts as an AF towards the 5G Core Network and performs coordination of QoS flows to fulfill the end-to-end QoS requirements for the UEs involved in the TSC communication. It combines the roles of TSCTSF and TSC CNC (similar to the TSN CNC in the TSN integration case), which means that it controls the allocation of resources of TSC communication within the boundaries of the 5G domain.\nUpon request from a VAL server via the NRM-S reference point it configures the TSC end-to-end QoS flows in the 5GS. In line with other SEAL service enablers the SEAL NRM server provides a RESTful interface on the NRM-S reference point.

      "content": "The NRM client and NRM server use this procedure to report and take action on the MBMS bearer quality towards VAL service communications. A NRM client monitors an MBMS bearer to enable receiving VAL service communication. Based on the received quality (e.g. radio level quality, transport level quality), the NRM client needs to inform the NRM server that the VAL UE is able to receive the VAL service communication on the MBMS bearer with sufficient quality or not able to receive the VAL service communication on the MBMS bearer with sufficient quality. Furthermore, based on the received quality, the NRM client may notify the NRM server at which MBMS reception quality level it has received the VAL service communication on the MBMS bearer.\nThe issue can be more complex since the NRM client needs to estimate the quality of the bearer even in the scenario when there are no data currently transmitted on the MBMS bearer. The reason for this is that an NRM client that has entered an area with significantly degraded MBMS quality, might not even notice that a VAL service communication is ongoing, meanwhile the NRM server still assumes that the VAL UE can receive the VAL service communication being broadcasted.\nTo estimate the MBMS bearer quality, for example as an equivalent BLER (Block Error Rate), when no data is sent is implementation specific. This estimation can be dependent on for example the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) and measurements from the reference signals from the eNB(s). Other metrics (e.g. RTP packet loss) may be used to estimate the MBMS bearer quality.\nBased on the MBMS bearer quality reported from the NRM clients, the NRM server may decide to use the MBMS bearer for a group communication if a certain number of NRM clients located in the MBMS service area are able to receive the VAL service communication. And if a NRM client is not able to receive the VAL service communication on the MBMS bearer, the NRM server may decide to switch the user plane deliver mode for the NRM client from MBMS bearer to unicast bearer.",

The NRM client may determine the MBMS bearer quality by using the BLER of the received data. When no data is received, the quality estimation can consider the reference signals and the modulation and coding scheme (MCS). The UE may also use predictive methods to estimate the expected MBMS bearer quality (e.g. speed and direction) to proactively inform the NRM server of an expected loss of the MBMS bearer quality. The NRM client may also map the determined MBMS bearer quality to a MBMS reception quality level. The MBMS reception quality level indicates at which specific MBMS bearer quality level the VAL service communication has been received.\nNOTE 1:\tThe set of MBMS reception quality levels and the mapping of the determined MBMS bearer quality to those levels are upto implementation.\nNOTE 2:\tWhen MBSFN transmission is used, the MBSFN reference signal needs to be used and when SC-PTM is used the cell specific reference signal needs to be used. With the measured reference signal, the reference signal received quality (RSRQ) can be calculated.\n2.\tIf the MBMS bearer quality reaches a certain threshold, the NRM client sends an MBMS listening status report. The threshold is used to define the MBMS listening status, which indicates if the MBMS bearer quality has been acceptable or not to receive a specific VAL service communication. If the MBMS bearer quality is mapped to a different MBMS reception quality level, the NRM client may send an MBMS listening status report including the MBMS reception quality level. Based on the MBMS listening status, if MBMS reception quality level is received, then the NRM server may efficiently decide to switch to another bearer (e.g., MBMS bearer or unicast bearer) or to take measures to prepare such a switch and further notify the VAL server.\nNOTE 3:\tPrior sending the MBMS listening status report, it could be beneficial to also include information for different alternatives e.g. another MBMS bearer might have better quality and could be a better option than a transfer of the communication to unicast.\nNOTE 4:\tThe threshold used to indicate MBMS bearer quality depends on VAL service type (i.e. V2X, MCPTT, MCVideo or MCData) and the metrics used. The metrics used and the associated thresholds are out of scope of this specification.\n3.\tThe NRM server may send additional proposal for measurements e.g. information about neighbouring MBMS bearers.

      "content": "The service continuity solution described in this subclause is suitable in the scenario when multiple MBMS bearers are used with the purpose to cover a larger area. In VAL communications several VAL service communication streams may be multiplexed in one MBMS bearer. Furthermore, one VAL service communication stream may be sent on more than one MBMS bearer if the receiving users are distributed over more than one MBMS service area. A VAL UE that is interested in receiving a VAL service communication stream that is broadcasted in both MBMS bearers is a candidate for this service continuity procedure.\nFigure 14.3.4.6.2-1 illustrates a deployment scenario that provides service continuity between two MBSFN areas. Two different MBMS bearers are activated (TMGI 1 and TMGI 2), the activation of the bearers is done in the two MBSFN areas (MBSFN 1 and MBSFN 2). The MBSFN areas 1 and 2 are partially overlapping, meaning that some transmitting cells belong to both MBSFN area 1 and MBSFN area 2.\nFigure 14.3.4.6.2-1: Two MBMS bearer using overlapping MBSFN areas\nFigure 14.3.4.6.2-2 illustrates the procedure:\nFigure 14.3.4.6.2-2: Service continuity when moving from one MBSFN to another\n1.\tThe VAL UE is located in MBSFN 1 and can listen to TMGI 1. No additional MBMS bearers that the NRM client is interested in are active in the current cell.\n2a.\tThe NRM client notifies the NRM server that the VAL UE is successfully receiving the VAL service communication over TMGI 1. The NRM client may also notify the MBMS reception quality level of TMGI 1.\n2b.\tThe NRM server notifies a user plane delivery mode to the VAL server.\nNOTE:\tThe MBMS reception quality level may be used by the NRM server to make an efficient decision to switch to another MBMS bearer or to a unicast bearer, or to take measures to prepare such a switch (e.g. when the quality level indicates that the reception quality of the MBMS bearer is decreasing or reaching an insufficient quality level for the reception of VAL services).\n3.\tThe VAL UE moves into a new cell in which both TMGI 1 and TMGI 2 are active. This cell is part of both MBSFN area 1 and MBSFN area 2, and broadcast the same service on both TMGIs.\n4.\tThe NRM client sends a location information report to the NRM server. For that, the UE uses the SAI information found in the system information block (SIB) transmitted by the radio cells.\n5.\tThe NRM server sends to the NRM client a MBMS bearer announcement with information related to TMGI 2 (if the NRM server had not done it before). Hence, the NRM client knows that TMGI 2 transmits the same VAL service communication.\n6a.\tThe NRM client notifies the NRM server that it is successfully receiving TMGI 1 and TMGI 2. The NRM client may also notify the MBMS reception quality level per TMGI.\n6b.\tThe NRM server notifies a user plane delivery mode to the VAL server.\n7.\tThe VAL UE may receive the VAL service communication over both MBMS bearers, i.e. TMGI 1 and TMGI 2. The VAL UE may also verify that it is the same content sent on both bearers. The duplicated packets may also be used to perform error corrections.\n8.\tThe VAL UE moves into a new cell in MBSFN area 2, where only TMGI 2 is active.\n9a.\tThe NRM client notifies the NRM server that the VAL UE is successfully receiving the VAL service communication over TMGI 2. The NRM client may also notify the MBMS reception quality level of TMGI 2.\n9b.\tThe NRM server notifies a user plane delivery mode to the VAL server.\n10.\tThe VAL UE receives the VAL service communication only over TMGI 2.\nThis service continuity procedure mitigates the risk of packet loss that may occur if the VAL UE would request to transfer the VAL service communication stream to a unicast bearer when moving into the new area and then back to a multicast bearer when the UE can listen to TMGI 2. However, it is still required that the NRM client sends a location report (and MBMS listening report), as described in steps 4-6 above. To send the location report and the MBMS listening report by the NRM client to the NRM server a unicast bearer is needed. The location report from the NRM client is required, since the NRM server must know that the VAL UE has entered a new area and can only listen to MBMS bearer active in that area. If this is not done the VAL server might send a VAL service communication stream that the VAL UE is required to listen to on the MBMS bearer 1, since the NRM server still assumes that the VAL:UE is located in the MBSFN area 1.\nThe solution can be improved as illustrated in figure 14.3.4.6.2-3. In this case two different MBMS bearers are activated (TMGI 1 and TMGI 2), these MBMS bearers are used only for VAL service communication. An application level signalling bearer is activated (TMGI 9), in both MBSFN areas. This bearer is used for application level signalling messages that are sent on the MBMS bearer TMGI 9. By using an application level signalling bearer (e.g. TMGI 9) the VAL UEs can receive application control messages for all VAL service communication going on in the areas of both TMGI 1 and TMGI 2. A VAL UE that is located in the area of TMGI 2 and is interested in a VAL service group transmission (e.g. V2X) only going on in TMGI 1, can with the information received in TMGI 9 initiate a unicast bearer and request to receive that specific VAL service communication over a unicast instead. Without the information received over TMGI 9 the NRM client must immediately report that the VAL UE has left the broadcast area that the NRM server assumes that the VAL UE is located in. With the use of TMGI 9 there is no immediate need for the NRM client to inform the NRM server of a location change.\nFigure 14.3.4.6.2-3: Two MBMS bearer using overlapping MBSFN areas with a separate application signalling bearer\nThe procedural steps in this scenario will be the same as described above in this subclause. However, in this scenario the NRM client is not required to initiate a unicast bearer to send location report (or MBMS listening report). The VAL UE may move between the two MBMS bearers (TMGI 1 and TMGI 2) without the need to report an area change. A condition for this to work is that there is an application level signalling bearer (TMGI 9) activated in the full area (i.e. the area of both TMGI 1 and TMGI 2). The TMGI 9 will broadcast all application control messages for all VAL service communications ongoing in both areas. If the VAL UE is in coverage of one of the two MBMS bearers that does not transmit the VAL service communication of interest the VAL UE can report to the NRM server that it is not able to listen to the VAL service communication over the MBMS bearer, which triggers the NRM server to switch to a unicast bearer instead.",

If there is no downlink data to the VAL client, this step can be skipped.\n6.\tThe VAL client ceases to receive the downlink data through previous bearer but continues receiving data through new bearer.\n14.3.4A\tMulticast resource management for 5GS\n14.3.4A.1\tGeneral\nThis subclause defines information flows and procedures for 5G MBS usage that applies to VAL services. 5G MBS session can be used by any VAL service for any VAL service group.\nThe main purpose of using 5G Multicast-Broadcast Service (MBS) by verticals is to provide efficient downlink delivery of user traffic in VAL service group communications or in a certain area.\nMulticast and broadcast communication services in 5G for vertical applicationsrely on the creation and establishment of MBS sessions to deliver user data in downlink. Shared and individual delivery from the VAL server to multiple VAL users is supported either as point-to-point or point-to-multipoint over the radio. The MBS session which consist of one or multiple QoS flows for different service requirements are either broadcast or multicast type. For the broadcast MBS session or local MBS session, the MBS service area is configured with the MBS session.\nNOTE 1:\tSupport of MBS and specific session types is an implementation choice.\nWithin this arrangement, the VAL server decides whether to create broadcast or multicast MBS sessions to be associated with certain VAL service groups or area. The 5GC adaptively decides whether to deliver the MBS traffic from the MB-UPF in the form of shared delivery or individual delivery, where the latter is applicable to multicast MBS sessions. The NG-RAN decides to utilize point-to-point or point-to-multipoint delivery methods applicable for shared delivery only. MBS provides reliability enhancements and minimizes loss of information, e.g., due to mobility and handover.\nMBS group scheduling mechanism enables simultaneous reception of MBS and unicast user traffic by the VAL UEs. The UEs can receive broadcast MBS sessions irrespective of their RRC state (i.e., connected, inactive or idle) and multicast sessions only in RRC‑CONNECTED state.\nThe following capabilities (non-exhaustive list) provided by MBS could be used by NRM server:\n-\tMBS session creation;\n-\tMBS session update;\n-\tMBS session release;\n-\tMBS session ID allocation;\n-\tDynamic PCC control for MBS session.\nThe first phase to utilize MBS sessions for VAL media transmission is to reserve the network resource by creating a MBS sessions. The MBS session creation is initiated by the VAL server towards the NRM server, and the NRM server further interacts with the 5GS to complete the whole process. The UE’s capabilities and service related information e.g., UE’s MBS capabilities, location, MBS listening status report, UE session join notification sent by group members are considered when deciding to create or use MBS sessions. During the interaction with NRM server, the necessary information related to the requested session is determined, e.g., MBS session mode (either a broadcast or a multicast session) and the required service profile. This interaction between the NRM server and the 5GS depends on the configuration option under consideration, i.e., whether the NRM server is in trusted domain (limited operations), and whether the session creation is done with or without a dynamic PCC rule.\nNOTE 1:\tIt is implementation specific whether the VAL server decides to use multicast or broadcast MBS sessions.\nNOTE 2:\tIt is implementation specific whether the VAL decides to create (one or multiple) MBS sessions for VAL media for VAL group communications associated to a certain VAL group or create (one or multiple) dynamic MBS sessions once the need has emerged, e.g., dynamic MBS sessions to be associated for an ad hoc group.\nNOTE 3:\tIt is implementation specific whether an MBS session is associated to one or multiple VAL service groups, and whether it is re-assigned to other VAL service groups.\nNOTE 4:\tHow the NRM server uses the UE’s capabilities and service related information in order to create and use the MBS session is implementation specific.\nThe information elements describing the MBS session under consideration is then sent to the NRM clients via MBS session announcement, where the latter need to react according to the announced session mode.\nIf eMBMS and 5G MBS co-exist for VAL services, the NRM service server may decide to trigger the establishment of an eMBMS bearer to deliver the VAL media associated to the VAL service group communications, if the target VAL service group(s) consists of members with MBMS capable RAT. As a result, the NRM server subsequently needs to send an eMBMS bearer announcement towards the clients camping on LTE.\nNOTE 5:\tIt is implementation specific whether the NRM server triggers an eMBMS bearer or a unicast bearer to serve VAL clients camping on LTE.\n14.3.4A.2\tMBS session creation and MBS session announcement\n14.3.4A.2.1\tGeneral\nThe procedures in this clause describe how MBS session creation and MBS session announcement can be used for the transmission of VAL service group communication data over either broadcast or multicast MBS sessions. The MBS session can either be created with or without dynamic PCC rule, where the latter requires less interaction done by the NRM server towards the 5GC (either directly or via NEF).\n14.3.4A.2.2\tProcedure for pre-created MBS session and MBS session announcement\nPre-conditions:\n-\tThe NRM server has decided to use an MBS session for VAL service group communications associated to a certain VAL servive group based on transport only mode.\n-\tThe NRM server has performed MB-SMF discovery and selection either directly or indirectly via NEF/MBSF, unless the corresponding information is locally configured.\n-\tNRM clients 1 to n are attached to the 5GS, registered and belong to the same VAL service group X.\n-\tThe NRM server is aware whether to request the creation of the MBS service server with or without dynamic PCC rule.\nFigure 14.3.4A.1.2-1: Use of pre-created MBS session.\n1.\tThe VAL server sends a multicast/broadcast resource request towards the NRM server including the VAL server identity, service description(s), multicast resource type (e.g,. multicast type or broadcast type), service announcement mode (i.e., service announcement is sent by NRM or the VAL itself), Endpoint of the VAL server.\n2.\tThe NRM server initiates an MBS session creation procedure towards the 5GC as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [39]. The procedure starts once the NRM server initiates a TMGI allocation request (either directly to MB-SMF or indirectly via NEF). Upon the reception of the TMGI allocation response, the NRM server sends an MBS session creation request, including further information related to the MBS session, e.g., MBS session ID, MBS session mode and the QoS requirements if dynamic PCC rule is not considered. However, if dynamic PCC rule is considered, the NRM server defines these requirements at a later step, namely it sends an MBS authorization/policy create request towards PCF (either directly or to the NEF) indicating the QoS requirements.\nIn the case of an untrusted NRM server, when the requested MBS service area crosses several MB-SMF service areas, the NEF/MBSF rejects the TMGI allocation request, and it guides the NRM server by dividing the requested MBS service area into groups and returns the groups as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [39]. Hence, the NRM server initiates a new TMGI allocation request for each grouped MBS service area.  If during MBS session creation request the 5GS discovers that the MBS service area crosses several MB-SMF service areas, the request is rejected and the NEF/MBSF guides the NRM server by dividing the requested MBS service area into groups and returns the groups as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [39]. The NRM initiates a new MBS session creation procedure for each grouped MBS service area.\nThe NRM server may utilize a unicast session if any MBS service area is not supported by any MB-SMF.\nNOTE 1:\tIn case of LTE eMBMS and 5G MBS co-existence, the NRM server may trigger the establishment of eMBMS bearers as described in clause 14.3.4 (or it may establish a unicast bearer) based on the RAT capabilities supported by the VAL service group members in the VAL service group X.

Based on the required updates to be done, the NRM server needs to interact with the MB-SMF to update the MBS service area and multicast activity status, with the PCF to update the required QoS requirements, or sequentially both to update all the above, as indicated in 3GPP TS 23.247 [39].\nPre-conditions:\n-\tThe NRM clients 1 to n are attached to the 5GS, registered and belong to the same active VAL service group.\n-\tThe NRM server has obtained the required information related to the MB-SMF, either locally configured or during initial session configuration.\n-\tThe MBS session is created with certain service requirements and optionally with a certain broadcast/multicast service area.

Hence, the NRM server sends a new MBS session creation request as described in clause 14.3.4A.1.2. for each grouped MBS service area.\n7.\tThe NRM server may initiate a session announcement towards the NRM clients associated with the ongoing session in order to announce the updated information if required, e.g., the updated service area or SDP information.\nNOTE 2:\tThe updated service area information is required for local MBS and for broadcast MBS services.\n8.\tThe NRM server sends an MapGroupToSessionStream over the MBS session providing the required information to receive the media related to the established VAL service group communication.\n9.\tThe NRM server returns the multicast resource update response to the VAL server.\n10.\tThe NRM clients process the received information over the MapGroupToSessionStream in order to receive the associated VAL media over the specific MBS session stream.\n11.

The MBS session deletion procedure leads to releasing the network resources associated to that MBS session.\nNOTE:\tIt is up to implementation of VALserver to decide whether to release the MBS session or re-use it for subsequent group operations.\nTo delete the MBS session, the VAL server invokes the multicast/broadcast resource release service of NRM server which further triggers the NRM server to send an MBS session deletion request to the 5GS providing the corresponding MBS session ID. The MBS session deletion request is sent to the MB-SMF (directly or via NEF/MBSF) when PCC is not used. However, if dynamic PCC rule is utilized, a policy authorization deletion request is initially sent to the PCF. Further details of the MBS session deletion are provided in 3GPP TS 23.247 [39].\nNRM server further informs the NRM client with the MBS session de-announcement, so that the VAL UE stops monitoring the broadcast MBS session or leaves the multicast MBS session. This procedure is applied for both broadcast MBS session and multicast MBS session.\n14.3.4A.4.2\tProcedure\nThe procedure in figure 14.3.4A.4.2-1 describes the MBS session deletion aspects for group communication.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tNRM clients 1 to n are attached to the 5GS, registered and affiliated to the same active VAL service group.\n-\tAn MBS session is configured to address the corresponding VAL service group with certain service requirements and optionally with a certain broadcast/multicast service area. The session is announced and established for group communication purposes for the VAL service group.\nFigure 14.3.4A.4.2-1: MBS session deletion procedure.\n1.\tThe VAL server decides to delete the MBS session for the associated VAL group communication, either multicast or broadcast session.\n2.\tThe VAL server invokes the multicast/broadcast resource release service of the NRM server by sending the multicast/broadcast resource release request.\n3.\tUpon receiving the multicast/broadcast resource release request, the NRM server sends an MBS session de-announcement message with the MBS session ID towards the NRM client(s). Upon receiving the MBS session de-announcement message, either 4a or 4b is performed.\n4a.\tIf the MBS session identified by MBS session ID is a broadcast MBS session, the UE(s) stops monitoring the broadcast MBS session and removes the broadcast MBS session related information.\n4b.\tIf the MBS session identified by MBS session ID is a multicast MBS session, the joined UE(s) initiate an MBS session leave procedure to leave the indicated MBS session in order to release the respective network resources, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.247 [39].\n5. Subsequently, the NRM clients may send an MBS session de-announcement acknowledgement message to the NRM server indicating the status of MBS session.\n6.\tThe NRM server initiates the MBS session deletion procedure with the 5GC (either directly or through NEF/MBSF) in order to stop using the configured MBS session and release the corresponding network resources. The NRM server indicates within the MBS session release request the corresponding MBS session ID. The MBS session deletion procedure can either be with or without a dynamic PCC rule, as indicated in 3GPP TS 23.247 [39].\n7.\tThe NRM server returns the multicast/broadcast resource release response to the VAL server indicating the result.\n14.3.4A.5\tRequest to activate / de-activate multicast MBS sessions\n14.3.4A.5.1\tGeneral\nIn case of multicast MBS sessions, the members affiliated to a certain VAL service group need to initiate a UE session join request towards the 5GC in order to receive the VAL media sent via the associated MBS session. The UE session join request enables the reservation of NG-RAN resources for the members of the VAL group. However, it is not necessary that the VAL media is delivered over the whole time the multicast MBS session is associated to the group under consideration. Therefore, the VAL server is able to efficiently utilize and control the reservation of radio resources based on the availability of VAL data to be delivered via the activation and de-activation procedure with NRM server. This presents more flexibility and efficient use of resources different from LTE.\nThe most suitable scenario to activate/de-activate a certain multicast MBS session is based on whether there is a VAL group communication, taking place over that associated session to the VAL service group. In this manner, the VAL server can activate the associated multicast session once a VAL group communication takes place, then deactivate it once the VAL group communication is over. Whether the multicast session is activated (i.e., in an active state), or de-activated (in an inactive state), the VAL group is associated to the multicast session and its members are within a UE session join.\nThe activation or de-activation request is initiated by the VAL server towards the NRM server which further interacts either directly with the MB-SMF or indirectly with NEF/MBSF.\nNOTE:\tThe activation of de-activation procedure may also be triggered by MB-SMF based on receiving notification from MB-UPF based on the availability of VAL data to be transmitted.\n14.3.4A.5.2\tMulticast MBS session activation procedure\nThe procedure shown in figure 14.3.4A.5.2-1 presents the multicast MBS session activation procedure initiated by the VAL server.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tNRM clients are attached to the 5GS, registered and affiliated to the same VAL service group X.\n-\tThe NRM server has directly performed (or via NEF/MBSF) an MB-SMF discovery and selection, unless the corresponding information is locally configured.\n-\tThe multicast MBS session for NRM group communications associated to VAL service group X.\n-\tThe MBS session is created and announced to address VAL group communication related to the associated VAL service group X with certain service requirements and optionally with a certain service area.\nFigure 14.3.4A.5.2-1: Multicast MBS session activation procedure.\n1.\tThe multicast MBS session is established as the first UE session join request, which is initiated by the first VAL UE towards 5GC, is granted. At this stage, the multicast MBS session is established with an inactive state.\n2.\tThe VAL server decides to activate the multicast MBS session as VAL data is needed to be transmitted over the session to the VAL service group X, as a VAL group communication is to take place over the associated MBS session.\n3.\tThe VAL server invokes the multicast resource activation request provided by NRM server, the MBS session ID is included.\n4.\tUpon receiving the request in step 3, the NRM server sends an MBS session activation request towards the 5GC, either directly to the MB-SMF or via NEF/MBSF, indicating the TMGI to be activated.\n5.\tThe 5GC changes the session status to \"active\" and finds the list of joined VAL UEs associated with the session and activates the NG- RAN resources for VAL data delivery.\n6.\tThe 5GC may send an MBS session activation response to the NRM server indicating that the requested multicast MBS session has been activated.\n7.\tThe NRM server returns the multicast resource activation response to the VAL server.\n14.3.4A.5.3\tMulticast MBS session de-activation procedure\nThe procedure shown in figure 14.3.4A.5.3-1 presents the multicast MBS session activation procedure initiated by the VAL server.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tNRM clients are attached to the 5GS, registered and affiliated to the same VAL service group X.\n-\tThe NRM server has directly performed (or via NEF/MBSF) an MB-SMF discovery and selection, unless the corresponding information is locally configured.\n-\tA multicast MBS session is created and announced to address the corresponding VAL service group with certain service requirements and optionally with a certain multicast service area.\n-\tThe VAL UE have already joined the multicast MBS session and are able to receive the VAL data over the associated MBS session.\nFigure 14.3.4A.5.3-1: Multicast MBS session deactivation procedure.\n1.\tThe group communication associated with VAL service group X takes place, and the corresponding VAL data is delivered over the associated multicast MBS session, hence the MBS session has an active state.\n2.\tThe VAL server decides to deactivate the multicast MBS session, as no further VAL data to be delivered to the associated group, or the VAL group communication is over, and no further VAL media is to be delivered.\n3.\tThe VAL server invokes the multicast resource deactivation request provided by NRM server, the MBS session ID is included.\n4.\tUpon receiving the request in step 3, the NRM server sends an MBS session deactivation request towards the 5GC, either directly to the MB-SMF or via NEF/MBSF, indicating the TMGI to be deactivated.\n4.\tThe 5GC changes the session state to \"inactive\" and deactivates the radio resources associated with the joined VAL UEs.\n5.\tThe 5GC may send an MBS deactivation response to the server indicating that the requested multicast MBS session has been inactivated.\n7.\tThe NRM server may return the multicast resource deactivation response to the VAL server.\n14.3.4A.6\tVAL service group media transmissions over 5G MBS sessions\n14.3.4A.6.1\tGeneral\nThe VAL server can decide to configure an MBS session per VAL service group to transmit the media related to the corresponding VAL group communications. Such group communications can comprise different service requirements. For that, multicast and broadcast MBS sessions need to be configured with multiple MBS QoS flows to address different service requirements, e.g., different required QoS, provided by the NRM server. For instance, application-level control messages or media associated to a group communication can comprise different QoS requirements. Also, different type of group communications can comprise different QoS requirements, e.g., emergency group communication should be handled with a higher priority than normal group communication.\nThe configuration of multiple MBS QoS flows to address different service requirements is associated to the assignment of different streams (e.g., different ports) within an MBS session.\nThe established multicast MBS session can either be in active or inactive state, where the former indicates the activation of radio resources hence transmitting the VAL media to the associated VAL service group, and the latter indicates their deactivation as no VAL media is being transmitted. The VAL server may initiate the activation of multicast MBS sessions once the VAL service group is established and active, as well as once the VAL media is available for transmission. For this purpose, the VAL server sends a multicast MBS session activation request towards the NRM indicating the MBS session ID to be activated, and the NRM server further interacts with the 5GS to complete the MBS session activation.\nSimilar to the use of eMBMS, the NRM server shall provide the associated information between a specific group communication and the stream to be used within an MBS session to the UE. This information could be sent in advance in an MBS session announcement or could be provided on demand in an additional signalling message for the MBS session, e.g., MapGroupToSessionStream (similar to the MapGroupToBearer in eMBMS).\n14.3.4A.6.2\tProcedure\nThe procedure in figure 14.3.4A.6.2-1 describes how media related to a specific group communication can be distributed over a configured MBS session which consist of multiple QoS flows, i.e. addressing different service requirements. The procedure is applicable for both the pre-created MBS session case as described in 14.3.4A.2.2 and the dynamic MBS session case as described in 14.3.4A.2.3. For simplicity, the figure 14.3.4A.6.2-1 shows that the MBS session is pre-created prior to the group communication establishment.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tVAL UE 1 to n are attached to the 5GS, registered and belong to the same VAL service group X.\n-\tThe VAL server has decided to use an MBS session for VAL service group communications associated to VAL service group X.\nFigure 14.3.4A.6.2-1: VAL service group media transmission over MBS sessions\n1.\tThe VAL server creates a multicast or a broadcast MBS session targeting group communications associated to VAL service group X via the NRM server, as being specified in clause 14.3.4A.2. Therefore, the VAL server can provide default service requirements to be addressed by the MBS session.\nThe MBS session is announced by NRM server and received by NRM client 2 to n. The NRM server has identified that VAL UE 2 to n can receive media over the MBS sessions, e.g. based on a notification from NRM clients indicating the successful join of the multicast MBS session or a monitoring report of the broadcast MBS session (similar to the listening status report used for MBMS).\n2.\tA new VAL group communication is established for the VAL service group X consisting of a specific required service requirements, e.g. a VAL service emergency group communication. The group communication setup can be done over unicast.\n2a. For broadcast MBS sessions, the session is established as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [39].\n2b. For multicast MBS session, the session is established upon the acceptance of the first UE session join request initiated from the VAL UE towards the 5GS, as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [39]. The multicast session can then have either an active or an inactive state.\n3. \tThe VAL server may initiate the multicast MBS activation towards the NRM as described in clause 14.3.4A.5 in order to activate the multicast MBS session in case the session has an inactive state.\n4.\tConsidering that the established group communication requires a specific QoS, e.g. an VALemergency group communication which requires higher priority (i.e. better ARP), the VAL server initiates an MBS session update to the NRM to provide the new required service requirements, if not done during the MBS session creation in step 1, as described in clause 14.3.4A.2. The MBS session should then be updated and an additional QoS flow may be configured.\n5.\tThe NRM server sends a MapGroupToSessionStream to NRM clients 2 to n over the configured MBS session providing the required stream information to receive the media related to the specific established VAL group communication within the MBS session.\n6.\tNRM clients process the MapGroupToSessionStream information to receive the related media over the specific MBS session stream.\n7.\tThe NRM server sends the user plane delivery mode message to the VAL server to instruct the VAL server to switch to MBS delivery.\n8.\tVAL client 1 sends media to the VAL server over unicast to be distributed for the established group communication.\n9.\tThe VAL server distributes the media to VAL clients 2 to n over the indicated stream within the established MBS session.\nNOTE:\tThe VAL server can stop the unicast delivery (if ongoing) towards the VAL clients considering the UE session join notification or the MBS listening status report.\n10.\tThe VAL server may initiate the multicast MBS session deactivation towards the NRM as described in clause 14.3.4A.5, in order to deactivate the multicast MBS session.\n11.\tThe NRM server may further trigger the UE to leave multicast MBS session.\n14.3.4A.7\tAplication level control signalling over 5G MBS sessions\n14.3.4A.7.1\tDescription\nThe VAL server may use an 5G MBS session for application level control signalling. An 5G MBS session for application level control signalling is typically used for the purposes beyond the benefit for using 5G for resource efficiency, e.g. for improved MC service performance (KPIs), handling of high load scenarios.\nSimilar to the usage of eMBMS, both broadcast and multicast 5MBS session for application level control signalling may be used to transmit the following messages, for example:\n-\tMBS session announcement for media sessions\n-\tGroup application paging\n-\tGroup dynamic data (e.g. status of the group)\n5G MBS session for application level control signalling is created in a service area that is larger than the estimated service for media MBS session. The service area for the media sessions is mainly based on counting of group members in each defined service area.

When working in transport only mode, the NRM server guides the NRM clients throughout the VAL data transmission for switching between the LTE and 5G systems. For this purpose, the location management client may send location related information to the location management server, similar to the one defined in clause 9, which is triggered due to its location change – in this case due to Radio Access Technology (RAT) change, to inform the NRM server hence the latter provides guidance related to how to receive the VAL data after the location update.\nThe procedures cover both the deployment scenarios with/without MBSF/MBSTF. The procedures specify four inter-system switching related scenarios as follows:\n1.\tInter-system switching from 5G MBS session to LTE eMBMS bearer, as in 14.3.4A.10.2\n2.\tInter-system switching from 5G MBS session to LTE unicast bearer, as in 14.3.4A.10.3\n3.\tInter-system switching from LTE eMBMS to 5G MBS session, as in 14.3.4A.10.4\n4.\tInter-system switching from LTE eMBMS to 5G unicast PDU session, as in 14.3.4A.10.5\nIn all the inter-system switching related scenario described in 14.3.4A.10.2, 14.3.4A.10.3, 14.3.4A.10.4 and 14.3.4A.10.5, the functional entity that resides in 5GS may be NEF, or MBSF, or MB-SMF for session creation and together with PCF or PCC related interaction.\nNOTE:\tThere will be a service interruption when the VAL server performs path switch between 5G and LTE bearers or sessions.\n14.3.4A.10.2\tInter-system switching from 5G MBS session to LTE eMBMS bearer\nThe procedure provided in figure 14.3.4A.10.2-1 describes how the NRM server handles inter-system switching when the VAL UE switches from 5G to LTE network, where the NRM server is able to provide the VAL data to the clients over eMBMS bearer(s).\nPre-conditions:\n-\tNRM clients are attached to the 5GS, registered.\n-\tThe VAL service can be provided via both 5GS and EPS.\n-\tThe NRM client(s) is within the eMBMS service area.\n-\tIt is assumed that the NRM client(s) has not received the eMBMS bearer announcement while camping in 5GS.\nFigure 14.3.4A.10.2-1: Inter-system switching from 5G MBS session to LTE eMBMS bearer.\n1.\tAn VAL group communication takes place, and the VAL data is delivered over 5G MBS session (either broadcast or multicast session mode), which is associated to the VAL group X.\n2.\tThe VAL UE performs handover to EPS.\n3.\tLocation information indicating the RAT change from the VAL UE is provided to the NRM server.

For that, the NRM server can subscribe to receive notifications of specific events from the network. For instance, the NRM server can subscribe to PCF related notifications (via N5 or Rx) for specific events, e.g., access network information notification and change of access type. Also, when SCEF+NEF is deployed, the NRM server can subscribe to SCEF+NEF related notifications for specific events, e.g., core network (CN) type change.\n4.\tThe NRM server analyses the RAT change and decides how to deliver the DL VAL data. If the NRM server decides to serve the client via eMBMS bearer, it may send an eMBMS bearer announcement. This step is optional as the bearer announcement related information could be sent in advance (implementation specific).\n5.\tIf not already available, the NRM client stores the announced TMGI(s), service area, and any relevant information to the eMBMS, which is delivered via the bearer announcement. As a result, the NRM client starts monitoring the bearer.\n6.\tThe NRM server may inform the VAL server to stop sending DL VAL data via the MBS by sending the user plane delivery mode message, e.g., when the last UE leaves the MBS session or move out of the MBS service area.\n7.\tThe NRM client sends an eMBMS listening status report to inform the server of its ability of receiving DL VAK data over the specified bearer.\n8.\tThe NRM server sends the necessary information related to receiving the DL VAL data in the form of the MapGroupToBearer.\n9.\tThe NRM server may inform the VAL server to start sending DL VAL data via the eMBMS by sending the user plane delivery mode message, e.g., the first UE(s) enters the eMBMS service area.\n10.\tThe VAL group communication takes place over EPS, and the VAL data is transmitted over an eMBMS bearer.\n14.3.4A.10.3\tInter-system switching from 5G MBS session to LTE unicast bearer\nThe procedure provided in figure 14.3.4A.10.3-1 describes how the NRM server handles inter-system switching when the VAL UE switches from 5G to LTE network, where the VAL server is unable to provide the VAL services to the VAL UE over eMBMS bearer.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tNRM clients are attached to the 5GS, registered and affiliated to the same VAL group X.\n-\tThe VAL services can be provided via both 5GS and EPS.\nFigure 14.3.4A.10.3-1: Inter-system switching from 5G MBS session to LTE unicast bearer.\n1.\tAn VAL group communication takes place, and the VAL data is delivered over 5G MBS session (either broadcast or multicast session mode), which is associated to the VAL group X.\n2.\tThe VAL UE performs handover to EPS.\n3.\tLocation information indicating the RAT change from the VAL UE is provided to the NRM server.

For example, the update may be provided only after repeated communication failures are received within a timespan, or only if high reliability communications are expected.

Setting it to 0 will disable PSM, extended idle mode DRX, and extended buffering. The NRM Server can extract the periodicity derived from the UE unified traffic pattern, which includes the schedule elements for the UEs communications with all VAL servers.

When the UE uses eDRX, Maximum Response Time is used by the network to determine when to send a reachability notification before a UE's paging occasion.  The NRM Server extracts a duration of activity from the schedule element of the UE unified traffic pattern and sets Maximum Response Time to reflect the duration of activity, indicating how long the UE should stay reachable for downlink communications.\n2.\tThe NRM Server performs the Network Parameter Configuration procedure as described in 3GPP TS 29.122 [54] clause 4.4.12.\nNOTE:\tThe values provided by NRM Server to 5GC in the Network parameter configuration procedure may or may not be accepted by the network.

The request may also include group ID, geographic information for the UEs, a request expiration time, guidance for policy selection. If guidance for policy selection is not included, the VAL Server indicates if the NRM Server may choose independently from among multiple transfer policies.\n2.\tBased on the request expiration time and Service Provider policies, NRM Server may determine to delay interactions with the 3GPP network in order to negotiate on behalf of multiple VAL Servers.\nThe NRM Server performs the procedure for negotiation of background data transfer policy as described in 3GPP TS 23.502 [11] clause 4.16.7.2. The procedure requires that expected data volume, expected number of UEs, and expected time window are provided by the NRM Server. If the NRM Server determines to negotiate on behalf of multiple VAL Servers, the parameters included reflects a superset of the individual VAL Server requests.\nNOTE 1:\tThe NRM Server determines to negotiate on behalf of multiple VAL Servers based on implementation options and local policies. For example, if the request expiration time and expected time window are sufficiently large and, respectively, far away in time, the NRM Server may be allowed to delay the negotiations with the 3GPP network in case another request is received, targeting the same group of UEs. If another request is received with expected time windows sufficiently close and if the guidance for policy selection allows, a single policy/time window may be negotiated instead. This allows the UE group to wake up only once for multiple background data transfers.\nThe 3GPP network determines one or more applicable BDT policies based on the requesting Background Data Transfer parameters. A list of BDT policies and a mandatory BDT Reference ID is provided to the NRM Server. Each BDT policy includes charging rating group reference and allocated time window and optional maximum UL and DL bandwidth as specified by 3GPP TS 23.503 [12]. The NRM Server uses ASP policies and the transfer selection guidance (if available) to select a BDT policy. The NRM Server informs the 3GPP Network of the selected BDT policy.\nNOTE 2:\tBased on 3GPP TS 23.503 [12] clause 6.1.2.4. it is assumed that the NRM server is configured to understand the charging rating group reference based on agreements with the operator.\nNOTE 3:\tThe NRM server utilizes the BDT warning notification from 3GPP network based on local policies.\n3.\tThe NRM Server stores the BDT configuration information with the information received from VAL server in step 1 along with the BDT Reference ID and selected BDT policy.

CoAP provides a request/response interaction model between application endpoints, supports built-in discovery of services and resources, and includes key concepts of the Web such as URIs and Internet media types. CoAP is designed to easily interface with HTTP for integration with the Web while meeting specialized requirements such as multicast support, very low overhead, and simplicity for constrained environments. RFC 7252 [32] specifies bindings to UDP and DTLS. IETF RFC 8323 [33] specifies bindings to TCP, WebSocket and TLS.\nFigure C.2-1 illustrates the functional model for the LWP signalling control plane when CoAP is used as the LWP.\nFigure C.2-1: Functional model for LWP signalling control plane when CoAP is used as LWP\nWhen CoAP is used to realize the generic light-weight protocol defined in clause 6.2, then,\n1.\tCoAP client is a realization of the LWP client\n2.\tCoAP proxy is a realization of the LWP proxy, with the following clarifications:\na.\tCoAP proxy shall be able to terminate a DTLS, TLS or secure WebSocket session on LWP-1 reference point;\nb.\tCoAP proxy shall be able to act as a cross-protocol CoAP-HTTP proxy to support LWP-HTTP-2 and LWP-HTTP-3 reference points;\n3.\tCoAP server is a realization of the LWP server\n4.\tCoAP supports the interactions over LWP-1, LWP-2 and LWP-3 reference points\n5.\tThe usage of CoAP by the SEAL service enablers shall follow the rules set out in clause 6.4.3.5.\nAnnex D (informative):Exemplary location profile attributes\nThe table D-1 shows the example of attributes that can be used for the location profiles.\nTable D-1: Exemplary location profile attributes\nProfile ID / name\nVertical / use case/environment\nPositioning Service Level (for IIOT) / QoS / accuracy\nPositioning Method(s) / Priorities\nInvolved 3GPP functionalities / Priorities\nRequired APIs / API info\nOther\nLocation profile #1\nIndustrial scenario; indoors; mobile robots/ AGVs\nService Level 6 /\ncm level accuracy / absolute/relative/ both\n1.
