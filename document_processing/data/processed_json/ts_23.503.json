For example, UE Local Configuration can include operator specific configuration (e.g. operator provided S-NSSAI(s)), or application specific parameters to set up a PDU Session or end user configuration for specific applications.\nUE Policy Association: An association between the AMF and the PCF (i.e. the PCF for the UE) for providing UE policy information from the PCF to the UE.\nUE policy information: Policy information preconfigured in the UE and/or provisioned to the UE for access selection (i.e. ANDSP), PDU Session selection (i.e. URSP), V2X communications (i.e. V2XP), ProSe operations (i.e. ProSeP), A2X communications (i.e. A2XP) and/or Ranging/Sidelink Positioning operations (i.e. RSLPP).\nUplink binding verification: The network enforcement of terminal compliance with the negotiated uplink traffic mapping to QoS Flows.\nUser Preferences On Non-3GPP Access Selection: The list of configuration parameters provided by a layer (e.g. application) above NAS and used by the UE for access network discovery and selection.\nVPLMN specific URSP Rules: A VPLMN specific URSP Rule is applicable when the UE is registered in that VPLMN or its equivalent PLMNs. A VPLMN specific URSP Rule may be used to route traffic to the VPLMN, if the V-PCF provides a local DNN to the AMF, using the PCRT on SMF selection management. A VPLMN specific URSP Rule may be used to route traffic to the Home PLMN if the HPLMN operator wants to provide a different list of RSDs for the same Traffic Descriptor for a VPLMN and for the HPLMN. When provided, the Time and Location criteria in the RSD(s) contain values that are based on agreements with the VPLMN or service parameters that were received from the VPLMN.",

If an NF is not able to reach the received PCF address(es) and applies direct discovery, it should query the NRF for PCF instances within the PCF set and select another instance.\n-\tFor the NF instance level of binding, the NF will receive a PCF set ID and a PCF instance ID. If an NF is not able to reach the received PCF address(es) and applies direct discovery, it should query the NRF for PCF service instances within the PCF and select another instance.\n-\tThe NF should provide a Routing Binding Indication based on the received PCF set ID, level of binding and possible PCF instance ID in requests it sends to the PCF.\n-\tFor an ongoing NF service session, the PCF may provide Binding indication to the NF (see clause 6.3.1.0 of TS 23.501 [2]). This Binding indication shall then be used instead of any PCF information received from the BSF.\n-\tIf a new PCF instance is selected, the new PCF should invoke Nbsf_Management_Update service operation to update the binding information in BSF.\nThe BSF may be deployed standalone or may be collocated with other network functions, such as PCF, UDR, NRF and SMF.\nNOTE 6:\tCollocation allows combined implementation.\n6.1.1.2a\tBinding an NF request targeting a UE to the relevant PCF for the UE\nWhen multiple and separately addressable PCFs have been deployed, a network functionality is required in order to ensure that a consumer NF (e.g. AF, 5G DDNMF) reaches the PCF serving the UE. This network functionality is provided by the BSF (described in clause 6.1.1.2.2) and has the following characteristics:\n-\tIt has information about the user identity, and the selected PCF address for a certain UE.\n-\tThe functionality determines the PCF address and if available the associated PCF instance ID and PCF set ID, selected by the PCF discovery and selection function described in TS 23.501 [2].\nNOTE:\tThe above is required e.g. for dynamic control of access and mobility related policy control functionality or for reporting events for a UE to a consumer such as 5G DDNMF.",

The PCF is notified when the congestion level reaches the threshold. The notification can include the identifiers of the applications that contribute the most to the traffic.\nThe NWDAF services to retrieve \"User Data Congestion\" analytics are described in clause 6.8 of TS 23.288 [24].\n-\tThe PCF may subscribe to notifications of network analytics related to \"Data Dispersion\" using NWDAF_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe service operation including the Analytics ID \"UE Dispersion Analytics\" and the dispersion analytic (DA) type, i.e. Data or Transactions. The Target of Analytics Reporting containing \"SUPI\", \"Internal Group Id\" or \"any UE\", and the Analytics Filter may include a list of TA(s) or an Area of Interest, or a list of Cells, or an S-NSSAI or top heavy users. With the Data Volume Dispersion Analytics type, the PCF may calculate the average data rate in the network slice by subscribing to notifications of network analytics related to Data Volume Dispersion in the network slice for a duration of interest when it sets the Target of Analytics Reporting as \"any UE\" and the Analytics Filter as the S-NSSAI.\nThe NWDAF services to retrieve \"Data Dispersion\" analytics are described in clause 6.10 of TS 23.288 [24].\n-\tThe PCF may subscribe to notifications of network analytics related to \"WLAN performance\" using the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe service operation including the Analytics ID \"WLAN performance\", the Target of Analytics Reporting \"SUPI\", \"Internal Group Id\" or \"any UE\" and the Analytics Filter including the Area of Interest, SSID(s), or BSSID(s). The PCF is notified on the WLAN performance statistics or predictions. In addition, the confidence of the prediction may be provided.\nThe NWDAF services to retrieve \"WLAN performance\" analytics are described in clause 6.11 of TS 23.288 [24].\n-\tThe PCF may subscribe to notifications of network analytics related to \"Session Management Congestion Control Experience\" using the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe service operation including the Analytics ID \"Session Management Congestion Control Experience\", the Target of Analytics Reporting containing \"SUPI\" and the Analytics Filter may include DNN and/or S-NSSAI. The PCF is notified on the Session Management Congestion Control Experience statistics including the DNN and/or S-NSSAI.\nThe NWDAF services to retrieve \"Session Management Congestion Control Experience\" analytics are described in clause 6.12 of TS 23.288 [24].\n-\tThe PCF may subscribe to notifications of network analytics related to \"DN Performance\" using the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe service operation including the Analytics ID \"DN Performance\", the Target of Analytics Reporting containing \"SUPI\", \"Internal Group Id\" or \"any UE\", and the Analytics Filter may include Application ID(s). The PCF is notified on the DN Performance statistics or predictions including Application ID(s). In addition, the confidence of the prediction may be provided.\nThe NWDAF services to retrieve \"DN Performance\" analytics are described in clause 6.14 of TS 23.288 [24].\n-\tThe PCF may subscribe to notifications of network analytics related to \"Redundant Transmission Experience\" using the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe service operation including the Analytics ID \"Redundant Transmission Experience\", the Target of Analytics Reporting \"SUPI\", \"Internal Group Id\" or \"any UE\" and the Analytics Filter including the Area of Interest, DNN, or S-NSSAI. The PCF is notified on the Redundant Transmission Experience statistics or predictions.\nThe NWDAF services to retrieve \"Redundant Transmission Experience\" analytics are described in clause 6.13 of TS 23.288 [24].\nIn the Analytic filter information of Analytics ID = \"Service Experience\" in Table 6.4.1-1 of TS 23.288 [24], some of the information is equal to the RSCs in URSP rules, for example, DNN, S-NSSAI, PDU session type, Access type and S-NSSAI. So, the PCF can request the analytic of different combinations of RSC values to NWDAF, and these RSC values can be listed in Analytics Filter Information of Analytics request/subscribe towards NWDAF. And the NWDAF can provide the analytic of these combinations of RSCs to PCF. For example, if the PCF subscribes the Analytics ID = \"Service Experience\" with analytic filter {DNN1, SSC mode 1}, the NWDAF can provide the analytic of RSC combination of DNN1 + SSC mode 1 to PCF. The PCF can know the performance of each of the RSC combination.\nNOTE 1:\tCare needs to be taken with regards to signalling and processing load caused when requesting analytics targeting \"Any UE\". A PCF preferably limits the analytics requests to a smaller UE set to reduce the load.\nPossible triggers for the PCF to subscribe to analytics information from the NWDAF may include:\n-\tRequests from AF/NEF;\n-\tAM Policy Association establishment or modification request from the AMF;\n-\tUE Policy Association establishment or modification;\n-\tSM Policy Association establishment or modification request from the SMF;\n-\tNotifications received from UDR or CHF on UE subscription change;\n-\tAnalytics information received.\nThe trigger conditions may depend on operator and implementation policy in the PCF. When a trigger condition happens, the PCF may check local configuration or evaluate operator policy to decide if any analytics information is needed and if so, initiate a subscription to the analytics information from the NWDAF directly or via DCCF, if deployed.\nThe PCF may, upon a request from AF/NEF for negotiation for future background data transfer, subscribe to the network analytics related to \"Network Performance\" from the NWDAF directly or via DCCF, if deployed to assist in determination of BDT policies as described in clause 6.1.2.4.\nThe PCF shall, upon a request from AF/NEF for negotiation for Planned Data Transfer with QoS requirements (PDTQ), subscribe to the network analytics related to \"Network Performance\" or \"DN Performance\" from the NWDAF directly or via DCCF, if deployed to assist in determination of PDTQ policies as described in clause 6.1.2.7.\nThe PCF may, upon AM or UE or SM Policy Association establishment or modification request from the AMF or SMF, or based on notifications received from UDR or CHF on UE subscription change, decide that network analytics related to \"Abnormal behaviour\", \"UE Mobility\" or \"UE Communication\" of the UE, \"Session Management Congestion Control Experience\", \"DN Performance\", \"User Data Congestion\" is needed for policy decision and therefore subscribe to notifications of those network analytics from the NWDAF.\nThe PCF may, upon reception of analytics information, subscribe to other analytics information from the NWDAF directly or via DCCF, if deployed.\nThe PCF may use the network analytics information as input to its policy decision to apply operator defined actions for session management related policy control (as described in clauses 6.1.3), non-session management related policy control (as described in clause 6.1.2) and network slice related policy control (as described in clause 6.1.4.\nIn roaming scenarios, the H-PCF may make policy decisions for the outbound roaming UEs based on network analytics provided by the V-NWDAF. The H-PCF performs discovery and selection of an H-NWDAF with roaming exchange capability (i.e. RE-NWDAF) as defined in TS 23.502 [3] and subscribes/unsubscribes to Analytics information from the V-NWDAF via the H-NWDAF as defined in TS 23.288 [24]. The H-PCF may request or subscribe to network analytics related to \"Service Experience\" or \"Load Level Information\" of the VPLMN. Based on these analytics, the H-PCF may update the URSP on Network Slice Selection Policy for the UE.\nThe PCF may, at AM Policy Association establishment or modification, subscribe to network analytics related to \"Load Level Congestion\" to request load information for the Allowed NSSAI.\nExamples of operator policies including network analytics information as inputs for policy decisions included below:\n-\tBased on the \"Load Level Information\" statistics or predictions of the Network Slice Instance, the PCF may verify if the RFSP index value needs to be modified for a SUPI for which an AM Policy Association is created; this is based on operator policies in the PCF, as defined in clause 6.1.2.1.\n-\tBased on the \"Service Experience\" statistics or predictions, the PCF may check the 5QI values assigned to the Application, and may use this as input to calculate and update the authorized QoS for a service data flow template.\n-\tThe PCF may use the network analytics related to \"Network Performance\" as input to calculate the background data transfer policies that are negotiated with the ASP, as defined in clause 6.1.2.4.\n-\tThe PCF may use the network analytics related to \"Network Performance\" or \"DN Performance\", as input to calculate the planned data transfer with QoS requirements policies that are negotiated with the ASP, as defined in clause 6.1.2.7.\n-\tBased on the UE mobility statistics or predictions, the PCF may adjust Service Area Restriction as defined in clause 6.1.2.1.\n-\tThe PCF may use the network analytics related to \"Unexpected UE location\" as input to determine the Service Area Restrictions defined in clause 6.1.2.1, \"Suspicion of DDoS attack\" or \"Too frequent Service Access\" to request the SMF to terminate the PDU Session as defined in clause 6.1.3.6, \"Wrong destination address\" to perform gating of a service data flow as defined in clause 6.1.3.6 and \"Unexpected long-live/large rate flows\" to perform QoS related policies such as gating or policing as defined in clause 6.2.1.1. Consequently, based on operator policies (that indicate that the PCF should store the subscriber status in the UE/AM/SM context), the PCF may store a Restricted Status for the subscriber in the Data Set \"Policy Data\" and Data Subset \"UE context policy control data\" or/and Data Subset \"Access and Mobility policy control data\" or/and Data Subset \"PDU Session policy control data\" in the UDR. The Restricted Status contains the reason for that status (i.e. Exception IDs listed in Table 6.7.5.3-3 of TS 23.288 [24]) and the time stamp set to the current time.\nNOTE 2:\tThis will allow the PCF for the UE to keep UE/AM context in case of AMF relocation with new PCF or/and in case of a new registration. This will allow the PCF for the PDU Session to keep the SM context in case of a PDU session establishment request. For example, if one or more exceptions (e.g. \"Unexpected UE location\" or \"Suspicion of DDoS attack\") are being reported by NWDAF for an individual UE, the current PCF can store a Restricted Status for the subscriber in the UDR along with the reason(s) and a Time stamp. A new PCF after AMF relocation or after a new registration, can automatically restrict the UE accordingly or/and immediately subscribe for the related analytics type at the NWDAF.\nBased on operator policies, network conditions and additional reports from NWDAF (e.g. UE moves out of Restricted service area), the PCF may remove the Restricted Status for the subscriber in the UDR for any of the Data Subsets listed above.\n-\tBased on the WLAN performance statistics or predictions, the PCF may update WLANSP as defined in clause 6.1.2.2.1.\n-\tBased on the \"User Data Congestion\" statistics or predictions including the list of applications contributing the most to the traffic the PCF may perform SM Policy Association modifications to update policies in the SMF for the PDU sessions handling traffic from those applications.\n-\tThe PCF may use the network analytics on \"Service Experience\" for an Application Identifier, \"any RAT type\" and/or \"any Frequency value\" to determine the RFSP Index value for running this application, as described in clause 6.1.2.1.\n-\tThe PCF may also use the network analytics as input to its policy decision to apply operator defined actions for example for the UE context(s) or PDU Session(s).\n-\tBased on the \"Load Level Information\" statistics or predictions for network slice(s), the PCF may give priority to consider the network slice(s) with lowest load for an application, and the PCF may update URSP on Network Slice Selection Policy.\n-\tBased on the \"Load Level Information\" statistics or predictions for network slice(s), the PCF may update the \"S-NSSAI availability information\" specified in clause 6.5, to indicate that an S-NSSAI is not available and to provide an Alternative S-NSSAI to replace with, this occurs when the Load Level Information reaches a threshold provided by the PCF.\n-\tBased on the \"Load Level Information\" statistics or predictions for network slice(s), the PCF may update the \"S-NSSAI availability information\" specified in clause 6.5, to indicate that an S-NSSAI is available again, and to indicate that replacement with the Alternative S-NSSAI does not apply any longer, this occurs when the Load Level Information goes below a threshold provided by the PCF.\n-\tBased on the \"UE communication\" statistics or predictions, the PCF may consider the DNN in Traffic characterization and associated Traffic Volume, Spatial validity and inactivity time, and the PCF may update URSP on DNN Selection Policy for associated UEs.\n-\tBased on the \"Dispersion Analytics\" statistics or predictions for Data Volume Dispersion in network slice(s), the PCF may calculate the average data rate in the network slice, and the PCF may update URSP on Network Slice Selection Policy for the associated UEs.\n-\tBased on the \"Session Management Congestion Control Experience\" statistics for PDU Session(s) associated with corresponding S-NSSAI(s) or DNN for a UE, PCF may give priority to consider the S-NSSAI or the DNN will be likely to that provide the lowest experience level of Session Management Congestion Control, and then the PCF may update URSP on Network Slice Selection Policy and/or DNN Selection Policy for the UE.\n-\tBased on the \"Network Performance\" statistics or predictions on gNB status information, gNB resource usage, communication performance and mobility performance in an Area of Interest, the PCF may consider to offload the traffic to non-3GPP access for the number of UEs that are located in that Area of Interest, and the PCF may update URSP on Non-Seamless Offload Policy for associated UEs.\n-\tBased on the \"User Data Congestion\" statistics or predictions including the list of applications contributing the most to the traffic, the PCF may consider to offload the traffic to non-3GPP access for those applications, and the PCF may update URSP on Non-Seamless Offload Policy for those applications.\n-\tBased on the \"DN Performance\" statistics or predictions for user plane performance for an application, the PCF may consider the DNN with higher performance, and the PCF may update URSP on DNN Selection Policy for the application.\n-\tBased on the \"Redundant Transmission Experience\" statistics or predictions, the PCF may update URSP for redundant PDU Sessions as described in clause 5.33.2.1 of TS 23.501 [2], e.g. by modifying the URSP rule for Network Slice Selection and DNN Selection.\n-\tBased on the \"Service Experience\" statistics or predictions, the PCF may select one or a combination of following: the network slice, the DNN, the PDU Session type, the SSC Mode, the Access Type, as one RSC or a combination of RSCs in URSP rule for an application, and the PCF may also adjust the RSD precedence in URSP in terms of statistics or predictions of the whole RSD (a combination of RSCs) and then the PCF may update URSP on one or several of Network Slice Selection Policy, DNN Selection Policy, PDU Session Type Policy, SSC Mode Selection Policy, Access Type preference and the priority of each RSD.\nExamples of operator policies including combination of multiple network analytics as inputs for policy decisions are included below:\n-\tBased on the notification of application(s) in use, provided by \"UE Communication\" analytics, the PCF may request the \"Service Experience\" analytics (optionally per RAT Type and/or per Frequency) for each application in use as defined in the list of examples of operator policies that may include network analytics as input for a policy decision.\n-\tBased on the \"User Data Congestion\" statistics or predictions, the PCF may further request the NWDAF directly or via DCCF, if deployed, to report the \"Data Dispersion Analytics\" of either a UE or just the Top Heavy UEs located at the congested area of interest. To mitigate the reported or predicted congestion at the area of interest, the PCF may perform:\n-\tAM Policy Association modification to update UE-AMBR, RFSP index and/or service area restriction, for those UEs reported as heavy users.\n-\tSM Policy Association modification to update the policies in the SMF for those UEs reported as heavy users.\n-\tUE Policy Association establishment/modification: Based on the \"Load level information\", \"Service Experience\", \"Network Performance\", \"Abnormal behaviour\", \"UE Mobility\", \"UE Communication\", \"User Data Congestion\", \"Data Dispersion\", \"Session Management Congestion Control Experience\", \"DN Performance\", \"User Data Congestion\" and \"WLAN performance\" statistics or predictions, the PCF uses analytics results from NWDAF to select proper values of URSP rules provided to UEs.\n-\tBased on the notification of Spatial validity for application(s) in use, provided by \"UE Communication\" analytics, the PCF may request the \"WLAN performance\" analytics for the Area of Interest derived from the Spatial validity of \"UE Communication\" analytics, and the PCF may update URSP on Non-Seamless Offload Policy for associated UEs.\nThe PCF may, upon UE Policy Association establishment or modification request from the AMF or based on notifications received from UDR or CHF on UE subscription change, subscribe to the analytics ID(s) listed in Table 6.1.1.3-1 from the NWDAF directly or via DCCF, if deployed, to adjust the fields (i.e. RSCs) and the RSD precedence in URSP rules.\nTable 6.1.1.3-1: Network analytics available for generation of each URSP field at the PCF\nURSP field\nAnalytics ID(s)\nRoute Selection Components\nS-NSSAI\n\"Service Experience\", \"Load level information\", \"Dispersion Analytics\", \"Session Management Congestion Control Experience\", \"Redundant Transmission Experience\".\nDNN\n\"Service Experience\", \"UE Communication\", \"Session Management Congestion Control Experience\", \"DN Performance\", \"Redundant Transmission Experience\".\nNon-Seamless Offload Indication\n\"UE Communication\", \"WLAN performance\", \"Load level information\", \"Network Performance\", \"User Data Congestion\".\nSSC Mode\n\"Service Experience\".\nPDU Session type\n\"Service Experience\".\nAccess Type Preference\n\"Service Experience\", \"WLAN Performance\".\nRoute Selection Validation Criteria\nTime Window\nBased on the validity period and spatial validity provided in the Analytics ID(s) used for RSD generation.\nLocation Criteria\nBased on the validity period and spatial validity provided in the Analytics ID(s) used for RSD generation.",

The CHF in the non-roaming case or the H-CHF in the Home Routed roaming case provides policy counters for spending limits to the PCF for the PDU Session. The CHF in the non-roaming case provides policy counters for spending limits to the PCF for the UE.\nThis functionality is applicable to session management related policy control, access and mobility management related policy control and UE policy control. The PCF determines to enforce SM, UE and/or AM policy based on subscriber spending limits as indicated by Subscriber spending limits control as described in clause 6.2.1.3, respectively.\nNOTE:\tIn the context of the above function, UE policy control refers to URSP only.\nThe PCF for the PDU Session and the PCF for the UE use the CHF selection mechanism defined in TS 23.501 [2] to select the CHF that provides policy counters for spending limits. If the home operator policies indicate that the same CHF shall be selected by the SMF and the (H-)PCF, the (H-)PCF for the PDU Session shall also provide the selected CHF address(es) and if available, the associated CHF instance ID(s) and/or CHF set ID(s) to the SMF in the PDU Session related policy information, otherwise the PCF for the PDU Session does not provide the selected CHF information to the SMF and the SMF applies the CHF selection mechanisms defined in TS 23.501 [2]. If the home operator policies indicate that the same CHF shall be selected by the PCF for the UE and the AMF, then the PCF for the UE shall also provide the selected CHF address(es) and if available, the associated CHF instance ID(s) and/or CHF set ID(s) to the AMF in the access and mobility management related policy information and/or in the UE Policy Association supplementary information, otherwise the PCF for the UE does not provide the selected CHF information to the AMF and the AMF applies the CHF selection mechanism defined in TS 23.501 [2].\nThe identifiers of the policy counters that are relevant for a policy decision in the PCF may be stored in the PCF or possibly in UDR. The PCF is configured with the actions associated with the policy counter status that is received from CHF.\nThe PCF may retrieve the status of policy counters in the CHF using the Initial or Intermediate Spending Limit Report Retrieval Procedure. The CHF provides the current status of the policy counters to the PCF. The CHF may in addition provide one or more pending statuses for a policy counter together with the time they have to be applied. The PCF shall immediately apply the current status of a policy counter. A pending status of a policy counter shall autonomously become the current status of a policy counter at the PCF when the indicated corresponding time is reached. Subsequently provided information for pending statuses of a policy counter shall overwrite the previously received information.\nThe PCF may subscribe to spending limit reporting for policy counters from the CHF using the Initial or Intermediate Spending Limit Report Retrieval procedure. If spending limit reporting for a policy counter is enabled, the CHF shall notify the PCF of changes in the status of this policy counter (e.g. daily spending limit of $2 reached or monthly spending limit of $60 is reached) and optionally pending statuses of this policy counter together with their activation time (e.g. due to a billing period that will expire at midnight). The PCF may cancel spending limit reporting for specific policy counter(s) using the Intermediate Spending Limit Report Retrieval procedure, or for all policy counter(s) using the Final Spending Limit Report Retrieval procedure.\nThe PCF uses the status of each relevant policy counter, and optional pending policy counter statuses if known, as input to its policy decision to apply operator defined actions, e.g.:\n-\tchange the QoS (e.g. downgrade or upgrade Session-AMBR or UE-AMBR), modify the PCC Rules to apply or remove gating or change charging conditions;\n-\tchange the URSP rule (e.g. remove or add an RSD that allows the UE to use a dedicated S-NSSAI and DNN).\nThe CHF may report to the PCF the removal of the subscriber from the CHF system, and the PCF shall remove all the policy counters of the subscriber accordingly.\nIf an operator policy indicates that a policy counter and its status should be available for a policy decision before the PCF retrieves the status of the policy counter from the CHF, the PCF stores the policy counter and its status in the UDR at termination of the respective UE Policy Association, AM Policy Association or SM Policy Association, as defined in TS 23.502 [3].",

      "content": "The access and mobility related policy control encompasses the management of service area restrictions, the management of the RFSP Index, the management of the UE-AMBR, the management of the UE Slice-MBR, the slice replacement management and the management of the SMF selection. This clause defines the management of service area restrictions and RFSP Index for a UE registered over 3GPP access. The management of service area restrictions for a 5G-RG or a FN-CRG using W-5GAN are specified in TS 23.316 [27].\nThe management of service area restrictions enables the PCF of the serving PLMN (e.g. V-PCF in roaming case) to modify the service area restrictions used by AMF as described in clause 5.3.4 of TS 23.501 [2].\nA UE's subscription may contain service area restrictions, which may be further modified by PCF based on operator defined policies at any time, either by expanding a list of allowed TAIs or by reducing a non-allowed TAIs or by increasing the maximum number of allowed TAIs. Operator defined policies in the PCF may depend on input data such as UE location, time of day, information provided by other NFs such as an AF request to change the service coverage, network analytics from NWDAF, etc.\nThe AMF may report the subscribed service area restrictions received from UDM during Registration procedure or when the AMF changed, the conditions for reporting are that local policies in the AMF indicate that access and mobility related policy control is enabled. The AMF reports the subscribed service area restrictions to the PCF also when the policy control request trigger for service area restrictions changes, as described in clause 6.1.2.5, is met. The AMF receives the modified service area restrictions from the PCF. The AMF stores them and then uses it to determine mobility restriction for a UE. The PCF may indicate to the AMF that there is an unlimited service area.\nThe service area restrictions consist of a list of allowed TAI(s) or a list of non-allowed TAI(s) and optionally the maximum number of allowed TAIs.\nNOTE 1:\tThe enforcement of the service area restrictions is performed by the UE, when the UE is in CM-IDLE state or in CM-CONNECTED state when in RRC Inactive, and in the RAN/AMF when the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state.\nThe management of the RFSP Index enables the PCF to modify the RFSP Index used by the AMF to perform radio resource management functionality as described in clause 5.3.4 of TS 23.501 [2]. The PCF may determine to modify the RFSP Index at any time based on operator policies that take into consideration e.g. accumulated usage, load level information per network slice instance, the indication that high throughput is desired for a specific application traffic or independently of the application in use and other information described in clause 6.1.1.3. If the modified RFSP index value indicates that EPC/E-UTRAN access is prioritized over the 5G access for the UE, the PCF may, based on operator policy, include a RFSP Index in Use Validity Time of the RFSP Index.\nThe determination of the RFSP Index value requires to configure the PCF with the mapping of RAT Type and/or Frequency value to the RFSP Index that will be sent to RAN.\nOperator policies in the PCF may modify the RFSP index based on the Allowed NSSAI, Target NSSAI, Partially Allowed NSSAI, S-NSSAI(s) rejected partially in the RA, rejected S-NSSAI(s) for the RA, Alternative S-NSSAI(s) mapped to some Replaced S-NSSAI(s) or Pending NSSAI as defined in clause 5.15 of TS 23.501 [2].\nOperator policies in the PCF may determine that the access and mobility related policy information (e.g. RFSP index value or service area restrictions) can change at the start and stop of an application traffic detection, at the start and stop of a SM Policy Association to a DNN and S-NSSAI, or immediately. In the former case, the PCF subscribes to the SMF for application traffic detection as described in clause 6.2.2.5. In addition, when the PCF evaluates that the access and mobility related policy information need any changes, the PCF reports it to the AF if the AF has subscribed to the notification on outcome of service area coverage change as defined in clause 6.1.3.18.\nOperator policies in the PCF may determine that the access and mobility related policy information (e.g. RFSP index value or service area restrictions) can change based on the Spending Limits information from CHF as defined in clause 6.1.1.4.\nFor radio resource management, the AMF may report the subscribed RFSP Index received from UDM during the Registration procedure or when the AMF changed. The conditions for reporting are that local policies in the AMF indicate that access and mobility related policy control is enabled. The AMF reports the subscribed RFSP Index to the PCF when the subscription to the RFSP Index change to the PCF is met. The AMF receives the modified RFSP Index from the PCF.\nNOTE 2:\tThe enforcement of the RFSP Index is performed in the RAN.\nUpon change of AMF, the source AMF informs the PCF that the UE context was removed in the AMF in the case of inter-PLMN mobility.\nThe management of UE-AMBR enables the PCF to provide the UE-AMBR information to the AMF based on serving network policy. The AMF may report the subscribed UE-AMBR received from UDM. The conditions for reporting are that the PCF provided Policy Control Request Triggers the AMF to report subscribed UE-AMBR. The AMF receives the modified UE-AMBR from the PCF. The AMF provides a UE-AMBR value of the serving network to the RAN as specified in clause 5.7.2.6 of TS 23.501 [2].\nThe management of the SMF selection enables the PCF to instruct the AMF to contact the PCF during the PDU Session Establishment procedure to perform a DNN replacement, as specified in clause 5.6.1 of TS 23.501 [2]. To indicate the conditions to check whether to contact the PCF at PDU Session establishment (as specified in clause 6.1.2.5), the PCF provides the Policy Control Request Triggers SMF selection management and, if necessary Change of the Allowed NSSAI, together with SMF selection management related policy information (see clause 6.5) during UE Registration procedure and at establishment of the AM Policy Association.\nThe PCF may update the SMF selection management information based on a PCF local decision or upon being informed about a new Allowed NSSAI. The AMF applies the updated SMF selection management information to new PDU Sessions only, i.e. already established PDU Sessions are not affected.\nThe management of the slice replacement enables the PCF to instruct the AMF to contact the PCF to provide the Alternative S-NSSAI for each S-NSSAI that requires slice replacement as specified in clause 5.15.19 of TS 23.501 [2]. The AMF reports S-NSSAI(s) of the serving network that requires slice replacement. The conditions for reporting are defined in clause 6.1.2.5. The PCF returns the Alternative S-NSSAI for the S-NSSAI of the serving network received from the AMF. The AMF receives the Alternative S-NSSAI for each S-NSSAI that requires slice replacement for which it has provided to the PCF.\nIf the AMF has indicated support of the Network Slice Replacement for the UE and the PCF detects the change in the availability of the S-NSSAI in the Allowed NSSAI (i.e. the S-NSSAI becomes unavailable or available) based on a PCF local decision (e.g. based on OAM or NWDAF analytics output), the PCF notifies the S-NSSAI availability information (see clause 6.5) based on the implicit subscription from the AMF. The AMF may also interact with the PCF to determine the Alternative S-NSSAI for S-NSSAI to be replaced based on Policy Control Request Triggers as defined in clause 6.1.2.5.\nThe optional management of UE-Slice-MBR enables the PCF to modify the value in the list of Subscribed UE-Slice-MBR assigned to a SUPI based on serving network policies, if the HPLMN permits based on roaming agreement. The AMF reports the Subscribed UE-Slice-MBR for each S-NSSAI of the serving network. The S-NSSAI of the VPLMN is derived from the Subscribed S-NSSAI by the AMF and provided to the PCF. The AMF may provide the Subscribed S-NSSAI together with the S-NSSAI of the VPLMN. The conditions for reporting are defined in clause 6.1.2.5. The PCF returns the authorized UE-Slice-MBR for the S-NSSAI of the serving network. The AMF receives the authorized list of UE-Slice-MBR value for each S-NSSAI for which it has provided the Subscribed UE-Slice-MBR from the PCF. Then the AMF provides the authorized list of UE-Slice-MBR for the S-NSSAIs in the Allowed S-NSSAI to the RAN as specified in clause 5.7.1.10 of TS 23.501 [2].\nThe optional management of 5G access stratum time distribution enables the PCF for the UE to instruct the AMF about the 5G access stratum time distribution parameters, i.e. 5G access stratum time distribution indication (enable, disable). Optionally, when 5G access stratum time distribution or (g)PTP time synchronization is enabled, the PCF for the UE instructs the AMF about the Uu Time synchronization error budget. Optionally, when 5G access stratum time distribution is enabled, the PCF for UE instructs the AMF about the clock quality reporting control information (clock quality detail level, clock quality acceptance criteria).\nIn the case that the PCF for the UE (providing the access and mobility related policy information) and the PCF for the PDU Session of this UE (providing the Session Management related policies) are separate PCF instances, the following applies:\n-\tIf the PCF for the UE determines that the access and mobility related policy information can change at the start and stop of an application traffic detection, the following applies:\n-\tThe PCF for the UE may subscribe to be notified when a PCF for the PDU Session is serving a DNN and S-NSSAI for a SUPI, this is achieved by either\n-\ta subscription request to be notified about the PCF binding information when a PCF for the PDU Session (of this UE) registers in the BSF, the PCF for the UE includes the SUPI, DNN, S-NSSAI in the subscription request to BSF. The DNN, S-NSSAI is either provided by the AF or locally configured in the PCF for certain Application Identifier(s); or\n-\tthe PCF for the PDU Session of this UE is to request the AMF to send to the PCF for the PDU Session of the DNN, S-NSSAI, via SMF, the PCF binding information (i.e. address(es) of PCF for the UE, instance id of PCF for the UE). In detail, the PCF for the UE provides its PCF binding information to the AMF together with DNN, S-NSSAI and Request for notification of SM Policy Association establishment and termination and the AMF will then forward the PCF binding to the SMF for every PDU Session with this DNN and S-NSSAI. In this case, the PCF for the PDU Session shall be notified via Request for reporting the PCF binding information Policy Control Request Trigger as described in clause 6.1.3.5.\nIn both cases above, the DNN, S-NSSAI is either provided by the AF or locally configured in the PCF for certain Application Identifier(s).\n-\tWhen the PCF for the UE is notified that PCF for the PDU Session is registered, either via the BSF that provides the UE address, DNN and the PCF address, PCF instance Id and PCF set id if available or via PCF for the PDU Session when it received PCF binding information from the SMF. The PCF for the UE may subscribe to the \"start/stop of application traffic detection\" event defined in clause 6.1.3.18 or trigger a policy decision if there is a SM Policy Association to the DNN, S-NSSAI.\n-\tThe reporting of \"start/stop of application traffic detection\" to the PCF for the UE is used as input for a policy decision to change the access and mobility related policy information.\nNOTE 3:\tThe PCF for the UE may subscribe to the notifications of newly registered PCF for the PDU Session and subscribe to the \"start/stop of application traffic detection\" events for multiple applications with different application identifiers. When PCF receives the notifications for multiple applications, the PCF for the UE can determine which access and mobility related policy information to apply based on local configuration and operator policy.\n-\tIf the PCF for the UE determines that the access and mobility related policy information can change at the establishment and termination of a SM Policy Association to a DNN and S-NSSAI base on the notification sent by the BSF, the PCF may indicate to the BSF to report the registration of a PCF for the PDU Session when the first SM Policy Association is established and the deregistration of the PCF for the PDU Session when the last SM Policy Association is terminated for a DNN, S-NSSAI.\n-\tThe PCF for the UE checks if an AF is subscribed to be notified on outcome of service area coverage change, using the related event defined in clause 6.1.3.18.",

      "content": "The 5GC shall be able to provide policy information from the PCF to the UE. Such UE policy information includes:\n1)\tAccess Network Discovery & Selection Policy (ANDSP): It is used by the UE for selecting non-3GPP accesses and for selection of the N3IWF in the PLMN. The structure and the content of this policy are specified in clause 6.6.1.\n2)\tUE Route Selection Policy (URSP): This policy is used by the UE to determine if a detected application or a PIN:\n-\tcan be associated to an established PDU Session; or\n-\tcan be offloaded to non-3GPP access outside a PDU Session; or\n-\tcan be routed via a ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay outside a PDU session; or\n-\tmulti-path communication via 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay outside of a PDU session and over Uu reference point or either path; or\n-\tcan trigger the establishment of a new PDU Session.\nThe structure and the content of this policy are specified in clause 6.6.2. A URSP rule includes one Traffic descriptor that specifies the matching criteria and one or more of the following components:\n2a)\tSSC Mode Selection Policy (SSCMSP): This is used by the UE to associate the matching application/PIN with SSC modes.\n2b)\tNetwork Slice Selection Policy (NSSP): This is used by the UE to associate the matching application/PIN with S-NSSAI.\n2c)\tDNN Selection Policy: This is used by the UE to associate the matching application/PIN with DNN.\n2d)\tPDU Session Type Policy: This is used by the UE to associate the matching application/PIN with a PDU Session Type.\n2e)\tNon-Seamless Offload Policy: This is used by the UE to determine that the matching application/Connectivity Group should be non-seamlessly offloaded to non-3GPP access (i.e. outside of a PDU Session).\n2f)\tAccess Type preference: If the UE needs to establish a PDU Session for the matching application/PIN, this indicates the preferred Access Type (3GPP or non-3GPP or Multi-Access).\nNOTE 1:\tThe Access Type of 3GPP also includes the use of ProSe UE-to-Network Relay access as defined in TS 23.304 [34].\n2g)\tProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay Offload Policy: This is used by the UE to determine if the matching application should be routed via a ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay outside of a PDU Session. If this indication is not present the traffic shall not be routed via a ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay outside of a PDU Session.\n2h)\tPDU Session Pair ID: If the UE needs to establish a PDU Session for the matching application, this indicates PDU Sessions with same PDU Session Pair ID are paired for redundant transmission.\n2i)\tRSN: If the UE needs to establish a PDU Session for the matching application, this indicates RSN for redundant transmission.\n2j)\tProSe Multi-path Preference: It indicates to UE whether a matching application is preferred to be routed via multipath (i.e. via a PDU Session over Uu reference point and via ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay outside of a PDU Session).\n3)\tV2X Policy (V2XP): This policy provides configuration parameters to the UE for V2X communication over PC5 reference point or over Uu reference point or both. V2X Policies are defined in clause 5.1.2.1 and clause 5.1.3.1 of TS 23.287 [28].\n4)\tProSe Policy (ProSeP): This policy provides configuration parameters to the UE for ProSe features as defined in clauses 5.1 of TS 23.304 [34].\n5)\tRanging/Sidelink Positioning Policy (RSLPP): This policy provides configuration parameters to the UE for Ranging/Sidelink Positioning control. Ranging/Sidelink Positioning Policies are defined in clause 5.1 of TS 23.586 [41].\n6)\tA2X Policy (A2XP): This policy provides configuration parameters to the UE for A2X communication over PC5 reference point or over Uu reference point or both. A2X Policies are defined in clauses 6.2.1.2.1 and 6.2.1.3.1 of TS 23.256 [43].\nThe ANDSP and URSP may be pre-configured in the UE or may be provisioned to UE from PCF. The pre-configured policy shall be applied by the UE only when it has not received the same type of policy from PCF.\nThe methods of configuring V2XP to the UE, including (pre-) configuration and provisioning, and the priority of the same type of parameters acquired from different sources are defined in clause 5.1.1 of TS 23.287 [28].\nThe methods of configuring ProSeP to the UE, including (pre-)configuration and provisioning, and the priority of the same type of parameters acquired from different sources are defined in clause 5.1.1 of TS 23.304 [34].\nThe methods of configuring A2XP to the UE, including (pre-) configuration and provisioning, and the priority of the same type of parameters acquired from different sources are defined in clause 4.2.1.2.2 of TS 23.256 [43].\nThe methods of configuring RSLPP to the UE, including (pre-) configuration and provisioning, and the priority of the same type of parameters acquired from different sources are defined in clause 5.1.1 of TS 23.586 [41].\nThe ANDSP policy, V2X Policy, ProSe Policy (ProSeP), A2X Policy (A2XP) and Ranging/Sidelink Positioning Policy (RSLPP) are not applicable to any of 5G-RG, FN-RG and AUN3 devices. The ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay Offload Policy, PDU Session Pair ID, RSN and ProSe Multi-path Preference components of the Route Selection descriptor are not applicable to 5G-RG, FN-RG and AUN3 devices.\nThe PCF selects the UE policy information applicable for each UE based on local configuration, operator policies taking into consideration the information defined in clause 6.2.1.2 and the PCF determines the URSP Rules for the UE using input from NWDAF as one of the inputs.\nIn the case of a roaming UE, the V-PCF may retrieve UE policy information from the H-PCF over N24/Npcf. When the UE is roaming and the UE has valid rules from both HPLMN and VPLMN, the UE gives priority to the valid ANDSP rules from the VPLMN.\nIn the case of a roaming UE, the V-PCF or UDR may provide the application guidance on VPLMN specific URSP determination to the H-PCF as defined in clause 4.15.6.10 of TS 23.502 [3] and clause 6.1.2.2.4. The H-PCF is required to generate VPLMN specific URSP rule(s) and provide the URSP rules to the UE. This can be triggered by the UE's registration in the VPLMN or it can happen before UE roams into the VPLMN. The URSP Rules received by UE for a VPLMN are only applicable when the UE is registered in that VPLMN or its equivalent VPLMNs. If a UE does not indicate support for VPLMN specific URSP rules, the H-PCF may still trigger an update of the UE's URSP Rules, which may be based on the application guidance from the VPLMN or HPLMN, upon receiving a notification that the UE has registered in the VPLMN.\nThe UE policy information shall be provided from the PCF to the AMF via N15/Namf interface and then from AMF to the UE via the N1 interface as described in clause 4.2.4.3 of TS 23.502 [3]. The AMF shall not change the UE policy information provided by PCF.\nThe PCF is responsible for delivery of UE policy. If the PCF is notified about UE policy information delivery failure (e.g. because of UE unreachable), the PCF may provide a new trigger \"Connectivity state changes\" in Policy Control Request Trigger of UE Policy Association to AMF as defined in clause 4.16.12.2 of TS 23.502 [3]. After reception of the Notify message indicating that the UE enters the CM-Connected state, the PCF may retry to deliver the UE policy information.\nNOTE 2:\tFor backward compatibility the PCF may subscribe the \"Connectivity state changes (IDLE or CONNECTED)\" event in Rel-15 AMF as defined in clause 5.2.2.3 of TS 23.502 [3].\nIf due to UE Local Configurations, a UE application requests a network connection using Non-Seamless Offload or ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay Offload, the UE shall use Non-Seamless Offload for this application without evaluating the URSP rules. Otherwise, the UE shall select the PDU Session or Non-Seamless Offload in the following order:\n-\tIf the UE has an URSP rule (except the URSP rule with the \"match all\" Traffic descriptor) that matches the application as defined in clause 6.6.2.3, the UE shall perform the association of the application to the corresponding PDU Session or to Non-Seamless Offload or ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay Offload according to this rule; Otherwise,\n-\tIf no URSP rule is applicable for the application (except the URSP rule with the \"match all\" Traffic descriptor), the UE shall perform the association of the application to a PDU Session according to the applicable UE Local Configurations, if any. If the UE attempts to establish a new PDU Session according to the UE Local Configurations and this PDU Session Establishment request is rejected by the network, then the UE shall perform the association of the application to a PDU Session or to Non-Seamless Offload or ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay Offload according to the URSP rule with the \"match all\" Traffic descriptor; Otherwise,\nNOTE 3:\tIt is assumed that the S-NSSAI(s) in the UE Local Configurations are operator-provided S-NSSAI(s). The provision of the S-NSSAI(s) is not specified.\nNOTE 4:\tThe application layer is not allowed to set the S-NSSAI when the UE establishes a PDU Session based on the UE Local Configurations.\nNOTE 5:\tAny missing information in the UE Local Configurations needed to build the PDU Session Establishment request can be the appropriate corresponding component from the URSP rule with the \"match all\" Traffic descriptor.\n-\tIf neither the UE Local Configurations nor the URSP rules are applicable for the application (except the URSP rule with the \"match all\" Traffic descriptor), the UE shall perform the association of the application to a PDU Session or to Non-Seamless Offload or ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay Offload according to the URSP rule with the \"match all\" Traffic descriptor.\nNOTE 6:\tThe UE evaluates both VPLMN and non-VPLMN specific URSP Rules as defined in clause 6.6.2.3.\nFor the existing PDU Session(s), the UE shall examine the URSP rules within the UE policy information in order to determine whether the existing PDU Session(s) (if any) are maintained or not. If not, then the UE may initiate a PDU Session release procedure for the PDU Session(s) that cannot be maintained.\nIf there are multiple IPv6 prefixes within the PDU Session, then the IPv6 multi-homed routing rules, described in clause 5.8.2.2.2 in TS 23.501 [2], on the UE shall be used to select which IPv6 prefix to route the traffic of the application.\nNOTE 7:\tFor the case that an application cannot be associated to any PDU Session, the UE can inform the application that association of the application to PDU Session fails.\nThe PCF may subscribe to analytics on \"WLAN performance\" from NWDAF following the procedures and services described in TS 23.288 [24]. When the PCF gets a notification from the NWDAF, the PCF may try to update WLANSP rules.\nThe PCF may use Spending Limits information from the CHF to decide whether to install, update or delete URSP rules, as defined in clause 6.1.1.4.\nThe definition of UE policy control for 5G-RG, FN-RG and AUN3 devices is specified in TS 23.316 [27]",

      "content": "The UE policy control enables the PCF to provide UE access selection related policy information, PDU Session related policy information, V2X Policy information, ProSe Policy information, A2X Policy information and Ranging/Sidelink Positioning Policy information to the UE, i.e. UE policies, that includes Access network discovery & selection policy (ANDSP) or UE Route Selection Policy (URSP) or V2X Policy (V2XP) or ProSe Policy (ProSeP) or A2X Policy (A2XP) or Ranging/Sidelink Positioning Policy (RSLPP) or their combinations using Npcf and Namf service operations.\nThe PCF may be triggered to provide the UE policy information during UE Policy Association Establishment and UE Policy Association Modification procedures as defined in clause 4.16.11 and clause 4.16.12 of TS 23.502 [3].\nNOTE 1:\tThe PCF can install a PCC Rule and activate start and stop of application detection in the SMF. When the same PCF is selected for SM Policy Association control and UE Policy Association control, the reporting of start and stop of an application can trigger the installation or update of a URSP rule in the UE to send the application traffic to the PDU Session as defined in the URSP rule.\nNOTE 2:\tThe PCF can subscribe to the UDR on service specific information change, which will be taken into consideration by the PCF to determine the updated V2XP, ProSeP, A2XP and RSLPP as defined in clause 4.15.6.7 of TS 23.502 [3].\nOperator defined policies in the PCF may depend on input data such as UE location, time of day, information provided by other NFs, etc. as defined in clause 6.2.1.2.\nThe PCF includes the UE policy information delivered to the UE into a Policy Section identified by a Policy Section Identifier (PSI). The PCF may divide the UE policy information into different Policy Sections, each one identified by a PSI. Each Policy Section provides a list of self-contained UE policy information to the UE, via AMF. The PCF ensures that a Policy Section is under a predefined size limit, known by the PCF.\nNOTE 3:\tThe size limit to allow the policy information to be delivered using NAS transport is specified in TS 29.507 [13]. The size limit is configured in the PCF.\nA list of self-contained UE policy information implies that:\n-\twhen the PCF delivers URSP rules to the UE, the PCF provides the list of URSP rules in the order of precedence and without splitting a URSP rule across Policy Sections;\n-\twhen the PCF delivers V2XP to the UE, the PCF provides the list of V2XP in the order of precedence and without splitting a V2XP across Policy Sections;\n-\twhen the PCF delivers ProSeP to the UE, the PCF provides the list of ProSeP in the order of precedence and without splitting a ProSeP across Policy Sections;\n-\twhen the PCF delivers A2XP to the UE, the PCF provides the list of A2XP in the order of precedence and without splitting a A2XP across Policy Sections;\n-\twhen the PCF delivers RSLPP to the UE, the PCF provides the list of RSLPP in the order of precedence and without splitting a RSLPP across Policy Sections;\n-\twhen the PCF delivers WLANSP rules, the list of WLANSP rules are provided in the order of priority and without splitting a WLANSP rule across Policy Sections;\n-\twhen the PCF delivers the non-3GPP access network selection information, the whole list of non-3GPP access network selection information (as defined in clause 6.6.1.1) is provided in one Policy Section.\nIt is up to PCF decision how to divide the UE policy information into Policy Sections as long as the requirements for the predefined size limit and the self-contained content (described above) are fulfilled.\nNOTE 4:\tThe Policy Section list can be different per user. One PSI and its corresponding content can be the same for one or more users.\nNOTE 5:\tThe PCF may, for example, assign the URSP as one whole Policy Section, or it may subdivide the information in the URSP into multiple Policy Sections by assigning one or several URSP rules to each Policy Section.\nThe PLMN ID is provided to the UE together with UE policy information and it is used to indicate which PLMN a Policy Section list belongs to.\nNOTE 6:\tIf an operator uses multiple PLMN IDs then it is assumed that the above PLMN ID matches the SUPI of the UE.\nThe AMF forwards the UE policy information transparently to the UE. If the (H-)PCF decides to split the UE policies to be sent to the UE, the PCF provides multiple Policy Sections separately to the AMF and then AMF uses UE configuration Update procedure for transparent UE policies delivery procedure to deliver the policies to the UE, this is defined in clauses 4.2.4.3 and 4.16 of TS 23.502 [3].\nNOTE 7:\tThe AMF does not need to understand the content of the UE policy, rather send them to the UE for storage.\nThe UE shall update the stored UE policy information with the one provided by the PCF as follows (details are specified in TS 24.501 [22]):\n-\tIf the UE has no Policy Sections with the same PSI, the UE stores the Policy Section;\n-\tIf the UE has an existing Policy Section with the same PSI, the UE replaces the stored Policy Section with the received information;\n-\tThe UE removes the stored Policy Section if the received information contains only the PSI.\nThe UE keeps the received UE policies stored even when registering in another PLMN. The number of UE policies to be kept stored in the UE for PLMNs other than the HPLMN is up to UE implementation. If necessary, e.g. the number of UE policies stored in UE for PLMNs exceeds the maximum value, the UE may remove earlier stored UE policy in UE.\nNOTE 8:\tFor aspects related to URSP rules for an SNPN-enabled UE, please refer to clause 6.6.2.2.2.\nThe ANDSP for VPLMN, if provided within the UE policy in the UE Configuration Update procedure described in clause 4.2.4.3 of TS 23.502 [3], applies to the equivalent PLMN(s) indicated in the last received list of equivalent PLMNs in Registration Accept.\nAt Initial Registration or the Registration to 5GS when the UE moves from EPS to 5GS, the UE provides the UE Policy Container including one or more of the following information:\n-\tThe UE provides the list of stored PSIs which identify the Policy Sections associated to the home PLMN and the visited PLMN (if the UE is roaming) that are currently stored in the UE. If USIM is changed, the UE does not provide any PSI. If no policies are stored in the UE for the home PLMN, the UE does not provide any PSI associated to the home PLMN. If the UE is roaming and has policies for the home PLMN but no associated policies for the visited PLMN the UE includes only the list of PSIs associated to the home PLMN.\n-\tUE may indicate its ANDSP support to the PCF. If it is received, the PCF shall take it into account for the determination on whether to provide the ANDSP to the UE. The PCF does not provide ANDSP rules to the UE if the UE does not indicate support for ANDSP.\nNOTE 9:\tIn the roaming scenario, during AMF relocation with V-PCF change, if the H-PCF does not provide the Indication of UE support for ANDSP, then the behaviour of V-PCF to determine whether to provide ANDSP rules to the UE is implementation specific.\n-\tThe UE may also provide the OSId.\n-\tThe UE may indicate whether it supports the URSP Provisioning when attached in EPS. The PCF for the UE stores it at the UDR, see clause 6.2.1.3.\n-\tUE may indicate its capability of reporting URSP rule enforcement to network to the PCF. If it is received, the PCF shall take it into account as described in clause 6.6.2.4.\n-\tThe UE may indicate whether it supports VPLMN specific URSP rules.\nThe UE may trigger an Initial registration with the list of stored PSIs to request a synchronization for example if the UE powers up without USIM being changed.\nDuring Initial Registration, the (H-)PCF retrieves the list of PSIs and its content stored in the (H-)UDR for this SUPI while the V-PCF (in the roaming scenario) retrieves the list of PSIs and its content stored in the V-UDR for the PLMN ID of this UE (alternatively, the V-PCF can have this information configured locally).\nNOTE 10:\tThe PSI list and content stored/configured for a PLMN ID can be structured according to e.g. location areas (e.g. TAs, PRAs). The V-PCF can then provide PSIs and its content only if they correspond to the current UE location.\nIn the roaming scenario, the V-PCF shall also forward any UE provided PSIs that are associated to the home PLMN to the H-PCF.\nWhen the PCF (i.e. the (H-)PCF as well as the V-PCF) receives a list of PSIs associated to the PLMN of the PCF from the UE, the PCF compares the list of PSIs provided by the UE and the list of PSIs retrieved from the UDR. In addition, the PCF checks whether the list of PSIs provided by the UE or its content needs to be updated according to operator policies, e.g. change of Location and/or time. If the two lists of PSIs are different or an update is necessary according to operator policies (which includes the case that the UE did not provide a list of PSIs associated to the PLMN of the PCF), the PCF provides the changes in the list of PSIs or the corresponding content to the AMF which forwards them to the UE.\nThe (H-)PCF maintains the latest list of PSIs delivered to each UE as part of the information related to the UE Policy Association until the UE Policy Association termination request is received from the AMF. Then the (H-)PCF stores the latest list of PSIs and its contents in the (H-)UDR using the Nudr_DM_Update including DataSet \"Policy Data\" and Data Subset \"Policy Set Entry\".\nThe (H-)PCF may use the PEI provided by the AMF and/or the OSId provided by the UE, to determine the operating system of the UE.\nIf the PEI, the OSId or the indication of UE support for ANDSP is available to the (H-)PCF, the (H-)PCF stores them in the (H-)UDR using Nudr_DM_Create including DataSet \"Policy Data\" and Data Subset \"UE context policy control data\" when such information is received from the UE in the UE Policy Container.\nIf the (H-)PCF is not able to determine the operating system of the UE, and if the (H-)PCF requires to deliver URSP rules that contain Application descriptors as Traffic Descriptors, then the Traffic Descriptors of such URSP rules include multiple instances of Application descriptors each associated to supported UE operating systems by the network operator implementation.\nIf the (H-)PCF determines the operating system of the UE and if the (H-)PCF requires to deliver URSP rules that contain Application descriptors as Traffic Descriptors, then the Traffic Descriptors of such URSP rules include the Application descriptors associated with the operating system determined by the PCF.\nNOTE 11:\tIf the PCF does not take into account the received PEI and/or OSId then the PCF can send URSP rules containing application traffic descriptors associated to multiple operating systems.\nWhen the PCF determines to provision VPLMN specific URSP rules to the UE (as described in clause 6.1.2.2.4) the PCF provides the URSP rules to be applied in VPLMN in specific Policy Section(s) identified by corresponding PSIs. Such Policy Section(s) do not include any non-VPLMN specific URSP rules. The PCF also provides to the UE the tuple (PLMN ID, list of PSIs of the Policy Sections containing URSP rules to be applied at specific VPLMN). The PCF may indicate the UE to add a new tuple(s), to update a stored tuple(s) or to remove a stored tuple(s), then the UE stores, updates, or removes the tuples as requested by the PCF (details are specified in TS 24.501 [22]). In roaming scenarios, the H-PCF provides this information via V-PCF. The PCF may provide, at any time, the full list of tuples (VPLMN ID(s), list of PSIs associated with the VPLMN ID) to the UE, and then the UE replaces any stored list of tuples with the new list of tuples provided by the PCF.\nAfter Registration procedure, the UE may perform UE triggered V2X Policy Provisioning procedure to request V2XP from the PCF as specified in clause 6.2.4 of TS 23.287 [28].\nAfter Registration procedure, the UE may perform UE triggered 5G ProSe Policy Provisioning procedure to request ProSeP from the PCF as specified in clause 6.2.4 of TS 23.304 [34].\nAfter Registration procedure, the UE may perform UE triggered A2X Policy Provisioning procedure to request A2XP from the PCF as specified in clause 6.3.2.3 of TS 23.256 [43].\nAfter Registration procedure, the UE may perform UE triggered Ranging/Sidelink Positioning Policy Provisioning procedure to request RSLPP from the PCF as specified in clause 6.2.4 of TS 23.586 [41].",

The list of parameters provided for application guidance on URSP Rule determination is defined in clause 4.15.6.10 of TS 23.502 [3] and the procedures are specified in clause 4.15.6.7 of TS 23.502 [3].\nThe AF may provide application guidance on URSP Rule determination to the VPLMN or to the HPLMN.\nWhen the AF provides application guidance on URSP Rule determination to the VPLMN, it will target \"PLMN ID(s) of inbound roamers\", the NEF in the VPLMN authorizes requests based on local configuration using e.g. the AF identifier before storing them in UDR, as defined in in clause 4.15.6.7 of TS 23.502 [3]. The NEF in the VPLMN rejects any request for a GPSI or an External-Group-ID of a different PLMN. The UDR in the VPLMN notifies the V-PCF(s) that has subscribed to the reception of application guidance on URSP determination.\nWhen the AF provides application guidance on URSP Rule determination to the HPLMN, it will target either a GPSI or an External-Group-ID or \"any UE\" of the HPLMN. The NEF in the HPLMN, may, based on the HPLMN operator local policy, authorize any request for a GPSI or an External-Group-ID and maps it into a SUPI or an Internal-Group-ID via UDM, before storing them in UDR as Application Data. The UDR notifies the H-PCF(s) that has subscribed to the reception of application guidance on URSP determination. The Application guidance on traffic routing may contain the VPLMN ID(s) where the Service Parameters apply.\nWhen the UE Policy Association is established or the V-PCF receives updates on application guidance on URSP determination with target PLMN ID(s) containing the HPLMN ID of a SUPI that has a UE Policy Association established, the V-PCF checks whether application guidance on URSP determination exists and applies for HPLMN ID of the SUPI.

Then the V-PCF sends the mapped application guidance on URSP determination including the HPLMN S-NSSAI values to the H-PCF;\n-\tsubscribes to the result of the delivery of UE Policies if it was requested by the AF to the H-PCF, using the event reporting on \"Notification on outcome of UE Policies delivery\" described in clause 6.1.3.18; and\n-\tchecks whether the requested application guidance are included in HPLMN subscription by checking the LBO Information (i.e. DNN(s) and/or S-NSSAI(s) that are allowed for LBO Session in VPLMN, which is part of SMF Selection Data) if the V-PCF received the LBO Information from the AMF. If LBO Information is not available at V-PCF in VPLMN or if the V-PCF needs to be made aware of any changes in the LBO Information, the V-PCF may send the PCRT for reporting the LBO Information.\nNOTE 1:\tThe AMF performs SMF selection to select the SMF in VPLMN for LBO case as described in clause 6.3.2 of TS 23.501 [2].\nThe H-PCF generates new or updated URSP Rules using the application guidance on URSP Rule determination. The VPLMN ID included in the Service Parameters of the application guidance from the AF to indicates that this URSP Rule applies when the UE is registered in the VPLMN. The H-PCF provides RSD values in the URSP Rules that are within the subscribed values defined in the S-NSSAI subscription information defined in Table 6.2.1.3-1. The H-PCF provides the list of PSIs applicable per VPLMN ID(s) to the UE. The VPLMN ID(s) corresponds to the VPLMN ID(s) included in the Service Parameters provided by the AF in application guidance. The VPLMN ID provided by the H-PCF may contain one or more specific values for the MCC and MNC and/or one or more wildcarded values for MCC and/or MNC.

      "content": "The Management of Packet Flow Descriptions enables the UPF to perform accurate application detection when PFD(s) are provided by an ASP and then to apply enforcement actions as instructed in the PCC Rule.\nThe operator is able to configure pre-defined PCC Rules in the SMF or dynamic PCC Rules in the PCF that include at least an application identifier for service data flow detection, charging control information, i.e. charging key and optionally the Sponsor identifier or the ASP identifier or both. Depending on the service level agreements between the operator and the Application Server Provider, it may be possible for the ASP to provide individual PFDs or the full set of PFDs for each application identifier maintained by the ASP to the SMF via the PFD Management service in the NEF (PFDF). The PFDs become part of the application detection filters in the SMF/UPF and therefore are used as part of the logic to detect traffic generated by an application. The ASP may remove or modify some or all of the PFDs which have been provided previously for one or more application identifiers. The SMF may report the application stop to the PCF for an application instance identifier as defined in clause 5.8.2.8.4 of TS 23.501 [2] if the removed/modified PFD in SMF/UPF results in that the stop of the application instance is not being able to be detected.\nNOTE 1:\tPFD management is optionally supported in the NEF and the SMF.\nThe ASP manages (provision, update, delete) the PFDs through the NEF (PFDF). The PFD(s) are transferred to the SMF through the NEF (PFDF). The PFDF is a logical functionality in the NEF which receives PFD(s) from the ASP through the NEF, stores the PFD(s) in the UDR and provides the PFD(s) to the SMF(s) either on the request from ASP PFD management through NEF (PFDF) (push mode) or on the request from SMF (pull mode). The PFDF functionality is a service provided by the NEF.\nThe ASP may provide/update/remove PFDs with an allowed delay to the NEF (PFDF). Upon reception of the request from the ASP, the NEF (PFDF) shall check if the ASP is authorized to provide/update/remove those PFD(s) and request the allowed delay. The NEF (PFDF) may be configured with a minimum allowed delay based on SLA to authorize the allowed delay provided by the ASP. When ASP and requested allowed delay are successfully authorized, the NEF (PFDF) shall translate each external application identifier to the corresponding application identifier known in the core network. The NEF (PFDF) stores the PFD(s) into the UDR setting \"AF\" as the source NF type (which is defined in clause 5.2.12.2.1 of TS 23.502 [3]).\nNOTE 2:\tThe Allowed Delay is an optional parameter. If the Allowed Delay is included, it indicates that the requested PFD(s) should be deployed within the time interval indicated by the Allowed Delay.\nThe PFDs may be retrieved by SMF from NEF (PFDF) in \"pull\" mode or may be provisioned from NEF (PFDF) to the SMF in \"push\" mode.\nWhen the \"push\" mode is used, the NEF (PFDF) retrieves from the UDR the PFDs for each application identifier and distributes them to those SMFs that enable access to those applications. There are three methods to provision PFD(s) from the NEF (PFDF) to the SMF:\na)\tPush of whole PFD(s) that can be accessed by the NEF (PFDF) according to operator configuration in NEF (PFDF) (e.g. provision per day according to operator configuration);\nb)\tSelective push of an ASP change in the PFD set (i.e. ASP changes the PFD set while operator configuration defines when to push);\nc)\tSelective push of an ASP change in the PFD set according to ASP request (i.e. ASP indicates to push changes in a PFD set within the time interval indicated by the Allowed Delay).\nWhen the \"pull\" mode is used, at the time a PCC Rule with an application identifier for which PFDs are not available is activated or provisioned, the SMF requests all PFDs for that application identifier from the NEF (PFDF), and NEF (PFDF) retrieves them from the UDR. The PFD(s) retrieved for an application identifier from the NEF (PFDF) are cached in the SMF, and the SMF maintains a caching timer associated to the PFD(s) to control how long the PFD(s) are valid. When the caching timer expires:\n-\tIf there are still active PCC rules that refer to the corresponding application identifier, the SMF reloads the PFD(s) from the NEF (PFDF) and provides it to the UPF over N4;\n-\tIf there's no active PCC rule that refers to the corresponding application identifier or the SMF removes the last PCC rule that refers to the corresponding application identifier, the SMF removes the PFD(s) identified by the application identifier and informs the UPF to remove the PFD(s) identified by the application identifier over N4.\nNOTE 3:\tIt is assumed that all SMF(s) and PFD (s) in an operator network are configured with the same default caching time value to be applied for all application identifiers.\nWhen the \"pull\" mode is used, the NEF (PFDF) may provide to the SMF a caching time value per application identifier. The SMF receives the caching time value together with the PFD(s) from the NEF (PFDF) over N29 and applies this value for the application identifier instead of the configured default caching time value. If no caching time value is received from NEF (PFDF), the SMF uses the configured default caching time value.\nNOTE 4:\tThe configuration of a caching time value per application identifier in NEF (PFDF) is based on the SLA between the operator and the ASP.\nWhen only \"pull\" mode is used in one PLMN for an application identifier, if the Allowed Delay is shorter than the caching time value stored for this application identifier, or shorter than the default caching time if no application-specific caching time is stored, the NEF (PFDF) may still store the PFD(s) to the UDR. The NEF (PFDF) shall provide an indication that the PFD(s) were stored and the caching time value to the ASP when informing that the Allowed Delay could not be met.\nWhen either \"pull\" mode or \"push\" mode is used, if there's any update of the PFD(s) received and there are still active application detection rules in the UPF for the application identifier, the SMF shall provision the updated PFD set corresponding to the application identifier to the UPF.\nNOTE 5:\tSMF should assure not to overload N4 signalling while managing PFD(s) to the UPF, e.g. forwarding the PFD(s) to the right UPF where the PFD(s) is enforced.\nWhen the UPF receives the updated PFD(s) from either the same or different SMF for the same application identifier, the latest received PFD(s) shall overwrite any existing PFD(s) stored in the UPF.\nIf the PFDs are managed by local O&M procedures, PFD retrieval is not used; otherwise, the PFDs retrieved from NEF (PFDF) overrides any PFDs pre-configured in the SMF. The SMF shall manage the pre-configured PFDs and PFDs provided by the NEF (PFDF) at the UPF as defined in clause 5.8.2.8.4 of TS 23.501 [2]. The SMF may differentiate the need for PFD retrieval based on operator configuration in the SMF.\nThe AF requests including an application identifier may trigger the activation or provisioning of a PCC Rule in the SMF by the PCF based on operator policies.\nThe NEF (PFDF) may subscribe to \"PFD Determination\" analytics from the NWDAF for an application identifier to assist determination of PFDs for known application identifiers as specified in TS 23.288 [24]. Based on the \"PFD Determination\" analytics received from the NWDAF, the NEF (PFDF) may determine to create PFD(s) for that application identifier, and then stores these PFD(s) in the UDR setting \"NWDAF\" as the source NF type (which is defined in clause 5.2.12.2.1 of TS 23.502 [3]). The NEF (PFDF) may also determine to modify or delete PFD(s) for that application identifier. The NEF(PFDF) shall only modify or delete PFD(s) if they contain \"NWDAF\" as the source NF type (i.e. they have been previously created based on \"PFD Determination\" analytics from the NWDAF) unless it has been agreed with the service provider owning the AF that changes to the PFDs provided by the AF are also permitted. The NEF (PFDF) then interacts with the UDR to modify or delete the corresponding PFD(s). If the NEF (PFDF) unsubscribes from \"PFD Determination\" analytics, the NEF (PFDF) should identify all PFDs for that application identifier which contain \"NWDAF\" as the source NF type (i.e. they have been previously created based on \"PFD Determination\" analytics from the NWDAF) and interact with the UDR to delete these PFD(s). The distribution of PFD updates triggered by NWDAF analytics shall be performed in the same way as PFD updates triggered by ASP requests, i.e. using the \"push\" and \"pull\" methods described above.",

      "content": "The AF may contact the PCF via the NEF (and Npcf_BDTPolicyControl_Create service operation) to request a time window and related conditions for future background data transfer (BDT).\nNOTE 1:\tThe NEF may contact any PCF in the operator network.\nThe AF request shall contain an ASP identifier, the volume of data to be transferred per UE, the expected amount of UEs, the desired time window, the External Group Identifier and optionally, Network Area Information, MAC address or IP 3-tuple to identify the Application server, request for notification. The AF provides as Network Area Information either a geographical area (e.g. a civic address or shapes), or an area of interest that includes a list of TAs or list of NG-RAN nodes and/or a list of cell identifiers. When the AF provides a geographical area, then the NEF maps it based on local configuration into of a short list of TAs and/or NG-RAN nodes and/or cells identifiers that is provided to the PCF. The NEF may map the ASP identifier based on local configuration to a DNN and S-NSSAI that is in addition provided to the PCF. The MAC address or IP 3-tuple to identify the Application server may be provided by the AF or may be locally configured at the PCF and it is used for the generation of a URSP rule for the application as well as a PCC rule for the application traffic. The request for notification is an indication that the ASP accepts that the BDT policy can be re-negotiated using the BDT warning notification procedure described in clause 4.16.7.3 of TS 23.502 [3].\nNOTE 2:\tA 3rd party application server is typically not able to provide any specific network area information and if so, the AF request is for the whole operator network.\nThe PCF shall first retrieve all existing BDT policies stored for any ASP from the UDR. The PCF may retrieve analytics on \"Network Performance\" from NWDAF following the procedure and services described in TS 23.288 [24]. Afterwards, the PCF shall determine, based on the information provided by the AF, the analytics on \"Network Performance\" if available and other available information (e.g. network policy and existing BDT policies) one or more BDT policies. The PCF may be configured to map the ASP identifier to a target DNN and S-NSSAI if the NEF did not provide the DNN, S-NSSAI to the PCF.\nA BDT policy consists of a recommended time window for the background data transfer, a reference to a charging rate for this time window and optionally a maximum aggregated bitrate (indicating that the charging according to the referenced charging rate is only applicable for the aggregated traffic of all involved UEs that stays below this value). Finally, the PCF shall provide the candidate list of BDT policies to the AF via NEF together with the Background Data Transfer Reference ID. If the AF received more than one BDT policy, the AF shall select one of them and inform the PCF about the selected BDT policy.\nNOTE 3:\tThe maximum aggregated bitrate (optionally provided in a BDT policy) is not enforced in the network. The operator may apply offline CDRs processing (e.g. combining the accounted volume of the involved UEs for the time window) to determine whether the maximum aggregated bitrate for the set of UEs was exceeded by the ASP and charge the excess traffic differently.\nNOTE 4:\tIt is assumed that the 3rd party application server is configured to understand the reference to a charging rate based on the agreement with the operator.\nThe selected BDT policy together with the Background Data Transfer Reference ID, the network area information, the volume of data to be transferred per UE, the expected amount of UEs, ASP identifier, MAC address or IP 3-tuple to identify the Application server, the one or more route selection component (DNN, S-NSSAI), the desired time window and whether the AF accepts BDT policy re-negotiation or not is stored by the PCF in the UDR as Data Set \"Policy Data\" and Data Subset \"Background Data Transfer data\". The same or a different PCF can retrieve this BDT policy and the corresponding related information from the UDR and take them into account for future decisions about BDT policies related to the same or other ASPs.\nWhen the AF wants to apply the Background Data Transfer Policy to an existing session, then the AF will, at the time the BDT is about to start, provide, for each UE, the Background Data Transfer Reference ID together with the AF session information to the PCF (via the N5 interface). The PCF retrieves the corresponding BDT policy from Policy Data Set in the UDR and derives the PCC rule for the BDT according to this transfer policy.\nWhen the AF wants to apply the Background Data Transfer Policy to a future session, then the AF provides, to the NEF, the Background Data Transfer Reference ID together with the External Identifier (i.e. GPSI) or External Group Identifier of the UE(s) that are subject to the policy. The NEF translates the External Group Identifier into the Internal Group Identifier or the External Identifier into a SUPI. The NEF stores the Background Data Transfer Reference ID, in the UDR as Application Data Set and Background Data transfer data Subset for an Internal Group Identifier or a SUPI and the ASP identifier requesting to apply the Background Data transfer Policy to a future session for the UE(s). A PCF that serves the UE(s) (i.e. the PCF that serves the UE for UE Policies) may retrieve the Background Data Transfer Reference ID by retrieving the UE's Application Data from the UDR or by subscribing to notifications of changes to the UEs' Application Data in the UDR. Furthermore, the PCF retrieves the specific Background Data Transfer Policy and the corresponding network area information and the MAC address or IP 3-tuple to identify the Application server based on the received Background Data Transfer Reference ID stored as Policy Data Set from the UDR.\nWhen the PCF determines to send a URSP rule related to the Background Data Transfer Policy to the UE, the PCF creates the URSP rule using the MAC address or IP 3-tuple (to identify the Application server) as Traffic descriptor. The RSD part of the URSP rule is populated with the S-NSSAI and DNN associated with the ASP identifier. The Route Selection Validation Criteria of the URSP rule (see clause 6.6.2.1) is populated with the Time Window set to the recommended time window of the BDT policy and, if the BDT policy is not applicable for the whole network, the Location Criteria is set to the network area information of the BDT policy. The PCF will store the URSP rule in the UDR as part of the UE's Policy Set Entry. The PCF will use the associated S-NSSAI and DNN associated with the ASP identifier stored in the Application Data to store the Background Data Transfer Reference ID in the UE's PDU Session policy control subscription information (see clause 6.2.1.3).\nThe PCF uses local policies to decide when the URSP rule related to the Background Data Transfer Policy is going to be sent to the UE. The PCF may, based on operator configuration, trigger the UE Configuration Update procedure when the AF request to apply the BDT policy to a future session is received, or the PCF may wait until receiving a notification from the AMF that the UE has entered the Tracking Area or Presence Area where the BDT policy applies, and/or the PCF may wait until the time window when the BDT policy applies is approaching.\nThe UE uses the Route Selection Validation Criteria to determine whether or not a PDU Session should be established. The Time Window and Location Criteria are not required to be checked again during the lifetime of the PDU Session. The UE's support of the Validation Criteria in a URSP rule is optional.\nNOTE 5:\tIf a non-supporting UE receives Validation Criteria, it ignores the URSP rule.\nWhen the PDU Session is established, the PCF that serves the PDU Session will use the Background Data Transfer Reference ID in the UE's PDU Session policy control subscription information (see clause 6.2.1.3) to retrieve the corresponding BDT policy and the related information from the UDR and derives the PCC rule for the BDT according to this information.\nNOTE 6:\tThe AF will typically contact the PCF for the individual UEs to request sponsored connectivity for the BDT.\nNOTE 7:\tA transfer policy is only valid until the end of its time window. The removal of outdated transfer policies from the UDR is up to implementation.\nThe PCF may reject the establishment of an SM Policy Association, (described in clause 4.16.4 of TS 23.502 [3]), if the S-NSSAI and DNN corresponding to a BDT policy and the Validation Criteria are not fulfilled. And based on this feedback, SMF will reject the PDU Session establishment.\nAfter successful PDU Session setup, PCF may trigger PDU Session release when Validation Criteria are no longer fulfilled.\nThe PCF may subscribe to analytics on \"Network Performance\" from NWDAF for the area of interest and time window of a BDT policy following the procedure and services described in TS 23.288 [24] indicating a Reporting Threshold in the Analytics Reporting information. The value for the Reporting Threshold is set by the PCF based on operator configuration. When the NWDAF determines that the network performance goes below the threshold, the NWDAF notifies the PCF with the network performance analytics in the area of interest and time window. When the PCF gets the notification from the NWDAF, the PCF may try to re-negotiate the affected BDT policies with AFs that accepted BDT policy re-negotiation. To do this, the PCF retrieves all the BDT policies together with their additionally stored AF provided information (e.g. their corresponding desired time window) from the UDR, identifies the BDT policies that are not desirable anymore due to the degradation of the network performance and tries to calculate new candidate BDT policies for the ASP(s) to select from. If the PCF does not find any new candidate BDT policy or the related AF did not accept BDT policy re-negotiation, the previously negotiated BDT policy shall be kept and no interaction with the ASP shall occur. If the PCF finds one or more new candidate BDT policies, the PCF notifies the related ASP(s) on both the BDT policy that is not valid any longer and the candidate BDT policies via NEF.\nThe PCF invalidates the BDT policy stored in the UDR for the corresponding BDT reference ID while the BDT policy re-negotiation is ongoing. The PCF shall reject a PDU Session request corresponding to an invalid BDT policy.\nWhen the AF receives the notification, the AF may select one of the BDT policies included in the candidate list, and then inform the PCF about the selected BDT policy. The PCF stores the newly selected BDT policy into the UDR for the corresponding Background Data Transfer Reference ID and removes the BDT policy that is no longer valid. The PCF is also updating the URSP rule corresponding to the BDT policy with the new Validation Criteria in the Policy Set Entry of all UEs. As a consequence, the PCF identifies the UEs for which the BDT policy was already provided and updates the URSP rule corresponding to the BDT policy using the procedure described in clause 4.16.12.2 of TS 23.502 [3].\nNOTE 8:\tA PCF can subscribe to notifications on changes in BDT policy in UDR.\nIf the AF does not select one of the BDT policies included in the candidate list, the PCF removes the BDT policy stored in the UDR together with the corresponding Background Data Transfer Reference ID and all related information as well as the URSP rule corresponding to the BDT policy in the Policy Set Entry of all UEs. As a consequence, the PCF identifies the UEs for which the URSP rule corresponding to the BDT policy was already provided and removes the URSP rule corresponding to the BDT policy using the procedure described in clause 4.16.12.2 of TS 23.502 [3].\nNOTE 9:\tThe PCF can also remove the no longer valid BDT policy after an operator configurable time for the case that the AF does not respond.",

The reporting includes the event with the serving PLMN ID.\nIf the SMF selection management trigger is set, then the AMF shall contact the PCF when the AMF detects that the UE requested an unsupported DNN and the PCF indicated DNN replacement of unsupported DNNs in the Access and mobility related policy information (see clause 6.5). The PCF shall select a DNN and provide the selected DNN to the AMF.\nIf the SMF selection management trigger is set, then the AMF shall contact the PCF when the UE requested a DNN within the list of DNN candidates for replacement for the S-NSSAI indicated in the Access and mobility related policy information (see clause 6.5). The PCF shall select the DNN and provide the selected DNN to the AMF.\nIf the slice replacement management trigger is set, the AMF shall contact the PCF:\n-\tin Case i) when AMF cannot determine the Alternative S-NSSAI for the S-NSSAI(s), e.g. NSSF doesn't provide Alternative S-NSSAI and there is no Alternative S-NSSAI in the AMF local configuration. The reporting includes that the trigger is met, the S-NSSAI(s) that requires slice replacement, as described in clause 6.1.2.1.\n-\tin Case ii) if the AMF can determine the Alternative S-NSSAI for the S-NSSAI(s) when network slice replacement applies for some S-NSSAIs, or if the AMF determines to stop the network slice replacement for some S-NSSAI(s) after receiving the Alternative S-NSSAI from OAM or network slice availability notification from NSSF. The reporting includes the trigger is met and S-NSSAI(s) that requires slice replacement and the corresponding Alternative S-NSSAI. If no corresponding Alternative S-NSSAI is provided, the PCF is informed no Alternative S-NSSAI is mapped to the replaced S-NSSAI(s) any longer.\nNOTE 2:\tThe Alternative S-NSSAI does not have to be a Subscribed S-NSSAIs.\nNOTE 3:\tAMF receiving network slice replacement notification from the PCF is not a trigger for the AMF to update the PCF with the mapping information between Alternative S-NSSAI and replaced S-NSSAI.\nIf the Connectivity state changes trigger is set, then the AMF shall notify the PCF when the UE connectivity state is changed e.g. from IDLE to CONNECTED. The AMF then reset the trigger.\nThe NWDAF info change trigger shall trigger the AMF to interact with the PCF when the list of NWDAF Instance IDs used for the UE or associated Analytics IDs used for the UE at the AMF are changed in the AMF.\nIf the Satellite backhaul category change trigger is armed, the AMF shall report the Satellite backhaul category to indicate the change between different types of satellite backhaul, or the change between satellite backhaul and non-satellite backhaul (as specified in clause 5.43.4 of TS 23.501 [2]) to the PCF. The PCF may take this into account to update UE Policy as defined in clause 6.1.2.2.\nThe AMF indicates a PCRT corresponding to wrong non-3GPP access when the UE has connected to a non-3GPP access that is not supporting the configured NSSAI. The AMF also indicates whether it is for untrusted or trusted non-3GPP access. This triggers the PCF to update the relevant policies on the UE e.g. WLANSP or Non-3GPP access network selection information.\nIf the LBO Information change is armed, the AMF shall report the LBO Information (i.e. DNN(s) and/or S-NSSAI(s) that are allowed in VPLMN for LBO roaming in SMF Selection Data) to the PCF when there is change in the LBO Information.\nIf the Access Type change trigger is met, the AMF reports the changed, the added or the removed Access Type and/or the changed RAT Type to the PCF.",

As Network Area Information, the AF may provide either a geographical area (e.g. a civic address or shapes), or an area of interest that includes a list of TAs and/or a list of NG-RAN nodes or a list of cell identifiers. When the AF provides a geographical area, the NEF maps it, based on local configuration, into an area of interest (i.e. a list of TAs or NG-RAN nodes list or cells identifiers list) and provides it to the PCF. The Request for notification can be included in the AF request to indicate that the ASP accepts that the PDTQ policy can be re-negotiated using the PDTQ warning notification procedures described in clause 4.16.15.2 of TS 23.502 [3].\nNOTE 2:\tA third party application server is typically not able to provide any specific Network Area Information and if so, the AF request is for the whole operator network.\nThe PCF shall firstly retrieve all existing PDTQ policies stored for any ASP from the UDR. Then the PCF subscribes to \"Network Performance\" analytics or \"DN Performance\" analytics from NWDAF following the procedures and services described in TS 23.288 [24]. The PCF may request threshold reporting or periodic reporting. Afterwards, the PCF shall determine one or more PDTQ policies, based on the information provided by the AF, the analytics on \"Network Performance\" or \"DN Performance\" and other available information (e.g. network policy and existing PDTQ policies).\nNOTE 3:\tWhether the PCF subscribes to \"Network Performance\" analytics or \"DN Performance\" analytics is based on PCF configuration. PCF implementation has to ensure that analytics information is available for the list of desired time windows and Network Area Information requested by the AF.\nA PDTQ policy consists of a recommended time window for the traffic transfer for each of the AF sessions for each of the UEs involved.\nFinally, the PCF shall provide the candidate list of PDTQ policies to the AF via NEF together with the PDTQ Reference ID. If the AF received more than one PDTQ policy, the AF shall select one of them and inform the PCF about the selected PDTQ policy and corresponding PDTQ Reference ID. The selected PDTQ policy together with the PDTQ Reference ID, the Network Area Information (if provided by the AF), ASP identifier, the list of desired time windows, the QoS Reference or individual QoS parameters, the Alternative Service Requirements in a prioritized order (if provided by the AF), the Number of UEs and the Request for notification of PDTQ policy re-negotiation (if provided by the AF) are stored by the PCF in the UDR as Data Set \"Policy Data\" and Data Subset \"Planned Data Transfer with QoS requirements data\". The same or a different PCF can retrieve this PDTQ policy and the corresponding related information from the UDR and take them into account for future decisions about PDTQ policies related to the same or other ASPs.\nWhen the recommended time window in the selected PDTQ policy is about to start, and the AF needs to make use of the PDTQ policy for existing or new sessions, the AF invokes the Nnef_AFsessionWithQoS_Create/Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create in order to set up the AF session with the required QoS.\nNOTE 4:\tIt is expected that the AF requests the same QoS (or at least a similar one) that has been provided during the PDTQ policy negotiation as otherwise, the time window recommendation in the negotiated PDTQ policy loses the baseline on which it has been derived.\nThe PCF may subscribe to analytics on \"Network Performance\" or \"DN Performance\" from NWDAF for the area of interest and time window of a PDTQ policy following the procedure and services described in TS 23.288 [24] indicating a Reporting Threshold or periodic reporting in the Analytics Reporting information. The value for the Reporting Threshold is set by the PCF based on operator configuration. When the NWDAF determines that the Network Performance or DN Performance reaches the Reporting Threshold, the NWDAF notifies the PCF with the Network Performance analytics or DN Performance analytics for the requested area of interest and time window. When the PCF gets the notification from the NWDAF, the PCF may try to re-negotiate the affected PDTQ policies with AFs that accept PDTQ policy re-negotiation. If periodic reporting is received, the PCF shall determine, based on the latest analytics information and previously selected PDTQ policy, whether the PDTQ policy should be updated or not. If the PCF determines to update the PDTQ policy, the PCF may try to re-negotiate the affected PDTQ policies with AFs that accepted PDTQ policy re-negotiation. To do this, the PCF retrieves all the PDTQ policies together with the corresponding AF provided information (e.g. the corresponding list of Desired time windows) from the UDR, identifies the PDTQ policies that are not desirable anymore due to the degradation of the Network Performance or DN Performance and calculates new candidate PDTQ policies for the ASP(s). If the PCF cannot determine any new candidate PDTQ policy or the related AF has indicated it does not accept PDTQ policy re-negotiation, the previously negotiated PDTQ policy shall be kept and no interaction with the ASP shall occur. If the PCF determines one or more new candidate PDTQ policies, the PCF notifies the related ASP(s) of the candidate PDTQ policies and corresponding PDTQ reference ID via NEF.\nWhen the AF receives the notification, the AF may select one of the PDTQ policies included in the candidate list, and then inform the PCF about the selected PDTQ policy and corresponding PDTQ Reference ID. The PCF stores the newly selected PDTQ policy into the UDR for the corresponding PDTQ Reference ID and removes the PDTQ policy that is no longer valid.\nIf the AF does not select any of the PDTQ policies included in the candidate list, the previously negotiated PDTQ policy shall be kept.",

When the PCF removes the association of a PCC rule to the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule, a new binding may need to be created between this PCC rule and a QoS Flow based on the binding mechanism described above.\nThe binding created between a PCC Rule and a QoS Flow causes the downlink part of the service data flow to be directed to the associated QoS Flow at the UPF (as described in clause 5.7.1 of TS 23.501 [2]). In the UE, the QoS rule associated with the QoS Flow (which is generated by the SMF and explicitly signalled to the UE as described in clause 5.7.1 of TS 23.501 [2]) instructs the UE to direct the uplink part of the service data flow to the QoS Flow in the binding.\nWhenever the binding parameters of a PCC rule changes, the binding of this PCC rule shall be re-evaluated, i.e. the binding mechanism described above is performed again. The re-evaluation may, for a PCC rule, result in a new binding with another QoS Flow. If the PCF requests the same change of the binding parameter value(s) for all PCC rules that are bound to the same QoS Flow, the SMF should not re-evaluate the binding of these PCC rules and instead, modify the QoS parameter value(s) of the QoS Flow accordingly.\nNOTE 3:\tA QoS change of the PDU Session related information Authorized default 5QI/ARP values doesn't cause the QoS Flow rebinding for PCC rules with the Bind to QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule Indication set.\nWhen the PCF removes a PCC Rule, the SMF shall remove the association of the PCC Rule to the QoS Flow. If the last PCC rule that is bound to a QoS Flow is removed, the SMF shall delete the QoS Flow.\nWhen a QoS Flow is removed, the SMF shall remove the PCC rules bound to this QoS Flow and report to the PCF that the PCC Rules bound to a QoS Flow are removed.\nThe QoS Flow binding shall also ensure that:\n-\twhen the PCF provisions a PCC rule, and if the PCC rule contains a TSC Assistance Container, the PCC rule is bound to a new QoS Flow and no other PCC rule is bound to this QoS Flow. Whenever the TSC Assistance Container of an existing PCC rule is changed, the binding of this PCC rule shall not be re-evaluated.\n-\tif a dynamic value for the Core Network Packet Delay Budget (defined in clause 5.7.3.4 of TS 23.501 [2]) is used, PCC rules with the same above binding parameters but different PDU Session anchors (i.e. the corresponding service data flows which have different CN PDBs) are not bound to the same QoS Flow.\nNOTE 4:\tDifferent PDU Session anchors can exist if the DNAI parameter of PCC rules contains multiple DNAIs.\n-\tFor MA PDU Session, PCC rules for GBR or delay critical GBR service data flows allowed on different access are not bound to the same QoS Flow even if the PCC rules contain the same binding parameters.\nNOTE 5:\tFor MA PDU Session, the GBR or delay critical GBR resource for a service data flow is allocated only in one access (as described in clause 5.32.4 of TS 23.501 [2]).\n-\tWhen the PCF provisions a PCC rule with Alternative QoS parameter Set(s), the PCC rule is bound to a new QoS Flow and no other PCC rule is bound to this QoS Flow.\n-\tThe SMF should not bind the PCC rule(s) for the service data flow(s) with enabled ECN marking for L4S and the PCC rule(s) for the service data flow(s) without enabled ECN marking for L4S to the same QoS Flow.\nNOTE 6:\tThe SMF can also, based on local configuration in the PCF and the SMF, bind a PCC Rule that does not include Indication of ECN marking for L4S to a new QoS Flow that supports ECN marking for L4S.\n-\tWhen the PCF provisions a PCC rule with QoS Monitoring Policy, the PCC rule is bound to a new QoS Flow and no other PCC rule is bound to this QoS Flow.\nNOTE 7:\tThe binding of PCC rule with QoS Monitoring policy to a new QoS Flow is only applicable to the Per QoS Flow per UE QoS Monitoring (as described in clause 5.33.3.2 of TS 23.501 [2]).\n-\tWhen the PCF provisions a PCC rule with Traffic Parameter Information, the PCC rule is bound to a new QoS Flow and no other PCC rule is bound to this QoS Flow.\n-\tWhen the PCF provisions a PCC rule with PDU Set Control Information, the PCC rule is bound to a new QoS Flow and no other PCC rule is bound to this QoS Flow. Whenever the PDU Set Control Information of an existing PCC rule is changed, the binding of this PCC rule shall not be re-evaluated.\n-\tWhen the PCF provisions a PCC rule with Data Burst Handling Information, the PCC rule is bound to a new QoS Flow and no other PCC rule is bound to this QoS Flow.",

If credit-authorization triggers and Policy Control Request Triggers require different levels of reporting of location change for a single UE, the location to be reported should be changed to the highest level of detail required. However, there should be no request being triggered for PCC rules update to the PCF if the report received is more detailed than requested by the PCF.\nNOTE 2:\tThe access network may be configured to report location changes only when transmission resources are established in the radio access network.\nThe Resource modification request trigger shall trigger the PCF interaction for all resource modification requests not tied to a specific QoS Flow received by SMF. The resource modification request received by SMF may include request for guaranteed bit rate changes for a traffic aggregate and/or the association/disassociation of the traffic aggregate with a 5QI and/or a modification of the traffic aggregate.\nThe enforced PCC rule request trigger shall trigger a SMF interaction to request PCC rules from the PCF for an established PDU Session. This SMF interaction shall take place within the Revalidation time limit set by the PCF in the PDU Session related policy information. The SMF reports that the enforced PCC rule request trigger was met and the enforced PCC Rules.\nNOTE 3:\tThe enforced PCC rule request trigger can be used to avoid signalling overload situations e.g. due to time of day based PCC rule changes.\nThe UE IP address change trigger shall trigger a SMF interaction with the PCF if a UE IP address is allocated or released during the lifetime of the PDU Session. The SMF reports that the UE IP address change trigger was met and the new or released UE IP address.\nThe UE MAC address change trigger shall trigger a SMF interaction with the PCF if a new UE MAC address is detected or a used UE MAC address is inactive for a specific period during the lifetime of the Ethernet type PDU Session. The SMF reports that the UE MAC address change trigger was met and the new or released UE MAC address.\nNOTE 4:\tThe SMF instructs the UPF to detect new UE MAC addresses or used UE MAC address is inactive for a specific period as described in TS 23.501 [2].\nThe Access Network Charging Correlation Information trigger shall trigger the SMF to report the assigned access network charging identifier for the PCC rules that are accompanied with a request for this trigger at activation. The SMF reports that the Access Network Charging Correlation Information trigger was met and the Access Network Charging Correlation Information.\nIf the Usage report trigger is set and the volume or the time thresholds, earlier provided by the PCF, are reached, the SMF shall report this situation to the PCF. If both volume and time thresholds were provided and the thresholds, for one of the measurements, are reached, the SMF shall report this situation to the PCF and the accumulated usage since last report shall be reported for both measurements.\nThe management of the Presence Reporting Area (PRA) functionality enables the PCF to subscribe to reporting change of UE presence in a particular Presence Reporting Area.\nNOTE 5:\tPCF decides whether to subscribe to AMF or to SMF for those triggers that are present in both tables 6.1.2.5-2 and 6.1.3.5-1. If the Change of UE presence in Presence Reporting Area trigger is available on both AMF and SMF, PCF should not subscribe to both AMF and SMF simultaneously.\nUpon every interaction with the SMF, the PCF may activate / deactivate reporting changes of UE presence in Presence Reporting Area by setting / unsetting the corresponding trigger by providing the PRA Identifier(s) and additionally the list(s) of elements comprising the Presence Reporting Area for UE-dedicated Presence Reporting Area(s).\nThe SMF shall subscribe to the UE Location Change notification from the AMF by providing an area of interest containing the PRA Identifier(s) and additionally the list(s) of elements provided by the PCF as specified in clause 5.6.11 of TS 23.501 [2] and in clause 5.2.2.3.1 of TS 23.502 [3].\nWhen the Change of UE presence in Presence Reporting Area trigger is armed, i.e. when the PCF subscribes to reporting change of UE presence in a particular Presence Reporting Area and the reporting change of UE presence in this Presence Reporting Area was not activated before, the SMF subscribes to the UE mobility event notification service provided by the AMF for reporting of UE presence in Area of Interest which reports when the UE enters or leaves a Presence Reporting Area (an initial report is received when the PDU Session specific procedure is activated). The SMF reports the PRA Identifier(s) and indication(s) whether the UE is inside or outside the Presence Reporting Area(s), and indication(s) if the corresponding Presence Reporting Area(s) is set to inactive by the AMF to the PCF.\nNOTE 6:\tThe serving node (i.e. AMF in 5GC or MME in EPC/EUTRAN) can activate the reporting for the PRAs which are inactive as described in the TS 23.501 [2].\nWhen PCF modifies the list of PRA id(s) to change of UE presence in Presence Reporting Area for a particular Presence Reporting Area(s), the SMF removes or adds the PRA id(s) provided in the UE mobility event notification service provided by AMF for reporting of UE presence in Area Of Interest. When the PCF unsubscribes to reporting change of UE presence in Presence reporting Area, the SMF unsubscribes to the UE mobility event notification service provided by AMF for reporting of UE presence in Area Of Interest, unless subscriptions to AMF remains due to other triggers.\nThe SMF stores PCF subscription to reporting for changes of UE presence in Presence Reporting Area and notifies the PCF with the PRA Identifier(s) and indication(s) whether the UE is inside or outside the Presence Reporting Area(s) based on UE location change notification in area of interest received from the serving node according to the corresponding subscription.\nNOTE 7:\tThe SMF can also be triggered by the CHF to subscribe to notification of UE presence in PRA from the AMF, and notifies the CHF when receiving reporting of UE presence in PRA from the AMF, referring to TS 32.291 [20].\nIf PCF is configured with a PRA identifier referring to the list of PRA Identifier(s) within a Set of Core Network predefined Presence Reporting Areas as defined in TS 23.501 [2], it activates the reporting of UE entering/leaving each individual PRA in the Set of Core Network predefined Presence Reporting Areas, without providing the complete set of individual PRAs.\nWhen a PRA set identified by a PRA Identifier was subscribed to report changes of UE presence in Presence Reporting Area by the PCF, the SMF additionally receives the PRA Identifier of the PRA set from the AMF, along with the individual PRA Identifier(s) belonging to the PRA set and indication(s) of whether the UE is inside or outside the individual Presence Reporting Area(s), as described in TS 23.501 [2].\nWhen the Out of credit detection trigger is set, the SMF shall inform the PCF about the PCC rules for which credit is no longer available together with the applied termination action.\nWhen the Reallocation of credit detection trigger is set, the SMF shall inform the PCF about the PCC rules for which credit has been reallocated after credit was no longer available and the termination action was applied.\nThe Start of application traffic detection and Stop of application traffic detection triggers shall trigger an interaction with PCF once the requested application traffic is detected (i.e. Start of application traffic detection) or the end of the requested application traffic is detected (i.e. Stop of application traffic detection) unless it is requested within a specific PCC Rule to mute such interaction for solicited application reporting or unconditionally in the case of unsolicited application reporting. The application identifier and service data flow descriptions, if deducible, shall also be included in the report. An application instance identifier shall be included in the report both for Start and for Stop of application traffic detection when service data flow descriptions are deducible. This is done to unambiguously match the Start and the Stop events.\nAt PCC rule activation, modification and deactivation the SMF shall send, as specified in the PCC rule, the User Location Report and/or UE Timezone Report to the PCF.\nNOTE 8:\tAt PCC rule deactivation the User Location Report includes information on when the UE was last known to be in that location.\nIf the trigger for Access Network Information reporting is set, the SMF shall check the need for access network information reporting after successful installation/modification or removal of a PCC rule or upon termination of the PDU Session. The SMF shall check the Access Network Information report parameters (User Location Report, UE Timezone Report) of the PCC rules and report the access network information to the PCF. The SMF shall not report any subsequent access network information updates received from the PDU Session without any previous updates of related PCC rule unless the associated QoS Flow or PDU Session has been released.\nIf the SMF receives a request to install/modify or remove a PCC rule with Access Network Information report parameters (User Location Report, UE Timezone Report) set the SMF shall initiate a PDU Session modification to retrieve the current access network information of the UE and forward it to the PCF afterwards.\nIf the Access Network Information report parameter for the User Location Report is set and the user location (e.g. cell) is not available to the SMF, the SMF shall provide the serving PLMN identifier to the PCF.\nThe Credit management session failure trigger shall trigger a SMF interaction with the PCF to inform about a credit management session failure and to indicate the failure reason, and the affected PCC rules.\nNOTE 9:\tAs a result, the PCF may decide about e.g. PDU Session termination, perform gating of services, switch to offline charging, change rating group, etc.\nNOTE 10:\tThe Credit management session failure trigger applies to situations wherein the PDU Session is not terminated by the SMF due to the credit management session failure.\nThe default QoS change triggers shall trigger the PCF interaction for all changes in the default QoS data received in SMF from the UDM.\nThe Session AMBR change trigger shall trigger the SMF to provide the Session-AMBR to the PCF containing the DN authorised Session AMBR if received from the DN-AAA, or the Subscribed Session-AMBR received from the UDM as described in clause 5.6.6 of TS 23.501 [2].\nThe default QoS change trigger reports a change in the default 5QI/ARP retrieved by SMF from UDM, as explained in clause 5.7.2.7 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf the PCC Rules bound to a QoS Flow are removed when the corresponding QoS Flow is removed or the PCC rules are failed to be enforced, the SMF shall report this situation to the PCF and may provide the reason for failure, if the reason for failure is that the UE is temporarily unreachable, the SMF may also provide the maximum waiting time to the PCF, in this case the PCF does not provide the same or updated PCC Rules for the established PDU Session before the maximum waiting time expires, the PCF may also subscribe to PCRT on change of UE reachability. In other failure scenarios, the PCF may then provide the same or updated PCC rules for the established PDU Session.\nNOTE 11:\tThe PCF can decide to provide PCC Rules when the maximum waiting time expires or send them later depending on implementation.\nIf the trigger for successful resource allocation is set and the PCF has also provided an indication that a specific PCC rule is subject to this trigger, the SMF shall report to the PCF when the resources associated to this PCC rule have been successfully allocated. The SMF shall report resource allocation failure always to the PCF, independently of this trigger. If the SMF reports resource allocation failure for a PCC rule containing MA PDU Session Control information with Redundant as Steering Mode (see clause 5.32.4 of TS 23.501 [2]), the SMF shall also indicate the respective Access Type.\nIf the GFBR of the QoS Flow can no longer (or can again) be guaranteed trigger is armed, the SMF shall check the need for reporting to the PCF when the SMF receives an explicit notification from (R)AN indicating that GFBR of the QoS Flow can no longer (or can again) be guaranteed or when the condition described in clause 5.7.2.4 of TS 23.501 [2] is met during the handover. The SMF shall report that GFBR of the QoS Flow can no longer (or can again) be guaranteed accordingly to the PCF for those PCC rules which are bound to the affected QoS Flow and have the QoS Notification Control (QNC) parameter set. If additional information is received with the notification from NG-RAN (see clause 5.7.2.4 of TS 23.501 [2]), the SMF shall also provide to the PCF the reference to the Alternative QoS parameter set corresponding to the Alternative QoS Profile referenced by NG-RAN. If NG-RAN has indicated that the lowest priority Alternative QoS Profile cannot be fulfilled, the SMF shall indicate to the PCF that the lowest priority Alternative QoS parameter set cannot be fulfilled.\nIn an interworking scenario between 5GS and EPC/E-UTRAN, as explained in clause 4.3 of TS 23.501 [2], the PCF may subscribe via the SMF also to the Policy Control Request Triggers described in clause 6.1.2.5 when the UE is served by the EPC/E-UTRAN.\nThe change of DN Authorization Profile Index shall trigger a SMF interaction to send DN Authorization Profile Index to retrieve a list of PCC Rules (as defined in clause 6.3) and/or PDU Session related policy (as defined in clause 6.4) for an established PDU Session.\nIf the trigger for 5GS Bridge/Router information available is armed, the SMF shall report the 5GS Bridge/Router information when the SMF has determined or updated the 5GS Bridge/Router information, e.g. when SMF has detected an Ethernet port which supports exchange of Ethernet Port Management Information Containers or received User plane node Management Information Container or Port Management Information Container. If a new manageable Ethernet DS-TT port is detected, the SMF provides User plane node ID, the port number and optionally MAC address of the related port of the related PDU Session to the PCF. If the SMF has received UE-DS-TT Residence Time then the SMF also provides UE-DS-TT Residence Time to the PCF. If the SMF has received the User plane node Management Information Container from NW-TT or Port Management Information Container from NW-TT or DS-TT, the SMF also provides User plane node Management Information Container or Port Management Information Container and related port number to the PCF. In the case of Deterministic Networking, the SMF may also provide the MTU size for IPv4 or the MTU size for IPv6.\nWhen the QoS Monitoring trigger is set, the SMF shall, upon receiving the QoS Monitoring report from the UPF, send the measurement report to the PCF.\nIf the Policy Control Request Trigger \"DDN Failure event subscription with Traffic Descriptor\" or \"DDD Status event subscription with Traffic Descriptor\" is set, the SMF shall request policies if it received a subscription or cancellation of notifications for availability after DDN Failure event with traffic descriptor or DDD Status event with traffic descriptor, respectively. The SMF indicates whether it is a subscription or cancellation event and provides the received Traffic Descriptor as well as the requested type(s) of notifications (notifications about downlink packets being buffered, and/or discarded) to the PCF. When the SMF indicates a subscription event, the PCF checks whether an installed PCC rule exists for the received Traffic Descriptor and if so, the PCF sets the Downlink Data Notification Control information of that PCC rule according to the requested type(s) of notifications. Otherwise, the PCF provides a new PCC Rule with the received Traffic Descriptor in the SDF Template, the Downlink Data Notification Control information set according to the requested type(s) of notifications and other PCC Rule information set to the same values as in the existing PCC rule that previously matched the traffic. When the new PCC has to be bound to the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rules, the PCF sets the \"Bind to QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule\" parameter. From now on, the PCF needs to keep the PCC rule for the DDD event detection fully synchronized with the existing PCC rule that previously matched the traffic for all other policy and charging control settings to ensure the same user experience and traffic treatment according to the operator policy. When the SMF indicates a cancellation event, the PCF removes the Downlink Data Notification Control information in the installed PCC Rule or removes the PCC Rule if a new PCC rule has been provided during the subscription event and this PCC rule is no longer necessary for any other policy enforcement.\nNOTE 12:\tDownlink Data Delivery (DDD) status event and DDN Failure event are specified in clause 4.15.3 of TS 23.502 [3].\nThe QoS constraints change trigger shall trigger a SMF interaction with the PCF if QoS constraints are received by the SMF during the lifetime of the PDU Session. The SMF reports that the QoS constraints change trigger was met and the new QoS constraints.\nWhen the Satellite backhaul category change trigger is armed, the SMF reports to the PCF that the Satellite backhaul category change was met and the new Satellite backhaul category (including satellite backhaul is no longer used) when it becomes aware that there is a change of the backhaul which is used for the PDU Session between different types of satellite backhaul, or between satellite backhaul and a non-satellite backhaul. The SMF determines whether or not a satellite backhaul is used and whether there is a change of backhaul based on signalling from the AMF as specified in TS 23.501 [2].\nNOTE 13:\tAs specified in clause 5.43.4 of TS 23.501 [2], Satellite backhaul category refers to the type of the satellite (or non-satellite) used in the backhaul. Only a single backhaul category can be indicated.\nThe NWDAF info change trigger shall trigger the SMF to interact with the PCF when the list of NWDAF Instance IDs used for the PDU Session or associated Analytics IDs used for the PDU Session are changed in the SMF.\nThe Request for reporting the PCF binding information indicates to the SMF to report to the PCF both the updated PCF binding information (of the PCF for the UE) and the Request for notification of SM Policy Association establishment and termination if both are received from the AMF.\nWhen the Notification on BAT offset trigger is set, the SMF shall, upon receiving a BAT offset and optionally an adjusted periodicity from the RAN (in a notification that GFBR of the QoS Flow can no longer be guaranteed as defined in clause 5.27.2.5.3 of TS 23.501 [2]), report the BAT offset and optionally the adjusted periodicity to the PCF for the PCC rule which is bound to the QoS Flow for which the notification from RAN was received.\nThe UE reporting Connection Capabilities from associated URSP rule trigger indicates to the SMF that when a UE includes Connection Capabilities in the PDU Session Establishment Request or PDU Session Modification Request, the SMF shall forward this information to the PCF as described in clause 6.6.2.4.\nThe UE Policy Container received or delivery failure for UE Policy Container delivery via EPS trigger shall trigger a SMF interaction with the PCF, if a UE Policy Container is received from the UE via EPS or in case of a delivery failure for UE Policy Container delivery via EPS (with appropriate reason, e.g. UE is not reachable), as described in clause 4.11.0a.2a.10 of TS 23.502 [3].\nNOTE 14:\tThe UE Policy Container can include a list of provisioned PSIs and/or UE capabilities (e.g. indication of supporting URSP rules over EPS) or the result of the delivery of the UE Policy Container as well as the result of processing the content of the UE Policy Container by the UE.\nWhen the Change of HR-SBO support indication trigger is armed, the H-SMF reports to the H-PCF that the HR-SBO support indication change was met. The H-SMF determines whether there is a change of HR-SBO support indication based on HR-SBO Request Indication from the V-SMF and/or the SM subscription data from UDM as described in clause 6.7.2.2 of TS 23.548 [33].\nThe Network Slice Replacement trigger shall trigger a SMF interaction with the PCF to notify change between S-NSSAI and Alternative S-NSSAI when the SMF determines that the existing PDU Session and existing SM Policy Association can be retained as described in clause 5.15.19 of TS 23.501 [2]. The SMF provides Alternative S-NSSAI if the PDU Session is transferred from a S-NSSAI to its Alternative S-NSSAI. The SMF indicates to the PCF that the PDU Session is transferred from the Alternative S-NSSAI to the replaced S-NSSAI, when the replaced S-NSSAI is available again and the PDU Session is transferred to the replaced S-NSSAI.\nNOTE 15:\tThe SMF reports to the PCF a PDU session transfer anytime when the PDU Session is transferred from one S-NSSAI to another S-NSSA.\nIf the 'ECN marking for L4S can no longer (or can again) be performed trigger' is armed, the SMF shall report to the PCF for those PCC rules which have enabled ECN marking for L4S (explicitly or implicitly as described in clause 6.1.3.22) if neither RAN nor UPF PSA ECN marking for L4S can be enabled on the affected QoS Flows, and when ECN marking for L4S can be enabled on the affected QoS Flows (again).\nWhen the UE reachability status change is armed, the SMF subscribes to event of \"UE reachability status\" by using the Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe defined in clause 5.2.2.3.1 of TS 23.502 [3]. The SMF reports a change of the UE reachability status to the PCF.",

      "content": "QoS control refers to the authorization and enforcement of the maximum QoS that is authorized for a service data flow, for a QoS Flow or for the PDU Session. A service data flow may be either of IP type or of Ethernet type. PDU Sessions may be of IP type or Ethernet type or unstructured.\nThe PCF, in a dynamic PCC Rule, associates a service data flow template to an authorized QoS that is provided in a PCC Rule to the SMF. The PCF may also activate a pre-defined PCC Rule that contains that association.\nThe authorized QoS for a service data flow template shall include a 5QI and the ARP and may include a 5QI Priority Level. For a 5QI of GBR or Delay-critical GBR resource type, the authorized QoS shall also include the MBR, GBR and may include the QoS Notification Control parameter (for notifications when authorized GFBR can no longer ( or can again) be fulfilled). For 5QI of Non-GBR resource type, the authorized QoS may include the MBR and the Reflective QoS Control parameter. The 5QI value can be standardized (i.e. referring to QoS characteristics as defined in clause 5.7.3 of TS 23.501 [2]), pre-configured (i.e. referring to QoS characteristics configured in the RAN) or dynamically assigned (i.e. referring to QoS characteristics provided by the PCF as Explicitly signalled QoS Characteristics in the PDU Session related policy information described in clause 6.4).\nNOTE 1:\tFurther details, special cases and additional parameters are described in clause 6.3.1.\nQoS control also refers to the authorization and enforcement of the Session-AMBR, default 5QI/ARP combination and 5QI Priority Level, if applicable. The PCF may provide the Authorized Session-AMBR, the Authorized default 5QI and ARP combination and the 5QI Priority Level as part of the PDU Session information for the PDU Session to the SMF. The Authorized Session-AMBR, Authorized default 5QI/ARP and if available, 5QI Priority Level values take precedence over other values locally configured or received at the SMF.\nIn home routed roaming, the H-SMF may provide the QoS constraints (defined in clause 5.7.1.11 of TS 23.501 [2]) received from the VPLMN (according to clause 4.3.2.2.2 of TS 23.502 [3]) to the H-PCF. The H-PCF ensures that the Authorized Session-AMBR value does not exceed the Session-AMBR value provided by the VPLMN, that the Authorized default 5QI/ARP contains a 5QI and ARP value supported by the VPLMN and if available, the applicable 5QI Priority Level is supported by the VPLMN. If no QoS constraints are provided the H-PCF considers that no QoS constraints apply unless operator policies define any. The PCF shall also consider the QoS constraints for the setting of the Subsequent Authorized default 5QI/ARP, if available, the applicable 5QI Priority Level and Subsequent Authorized Session-AMBR.\nFor policy control, the AF interacts with the PCF and the PCF interacts with the SMF as instructed by the AF. For certain events related to policy control, the AF shall be able to give instructions to the PCF to act on its own, i.e. based on the service information currently available. The following events are subject to instructions from the AF:\n-\tThe authorization of the service based on incomplete service information;\nNOTE 2:\tThe QoS authorization based on incomplete service information is required for e.g. IMS session setup scenarios with available resources on originating side and a need for resource reservation on terminating side.\n-\tThe immediate authorization of the service;\n-\tThe gate control (i.e. whether there is a common gate handling per AF session or an individual gate handling per AF session component required);\n-\tThe forwarding of QoS Flow level information or events (see clause 6.1.3.18).\nThe UE and the AF shall provide all available Flow Description information (e.g. source and destination IP address and port numbers and the protocol information) to enable the binding functionality and the generation or selection of the service data flow filter(s) in the PCC rules. The AF may also provide a ToS (IPv4) or TC (IPv6) value that is set by the application as part of the Flow Description information. The PCF generates a PCC Rule with service data flow filter(s) (either as IP Packet Filter set as defined in clause 5.7.6.2 of TS 23.501 [2] or as Ethernet Packet Filter set as defined in clause 5.7.6.3 of TS 23.501 [2]) derived from the Flow Description information.\nNOTE 3:\tA ToS/TC value can be useful when another packet filter attribute is needed to differentiate between packet flows. For example, packet flows encapsulated and encrypted by a tunnelling protocol can be differentiated by the ToS/TC value of the outer header if appropriately set by the application. To use ToS/TC for service data flow detection, network configuration by the operator (and additionally by the 3rd party Service Provider when the transport network is not fully within the operator control) needs to ensure there is no ToS/TC re-marking applied along the path from the application to the PSA UPF and the specific ToS/TC values are managed properly to avoid potential collision with other usage (e.g. paging policy differentiation). An example that the transport network is not fully within operator control is the Edge Hosting Environment according to TS 23.548 [33].\nIf SMF indicates that a PDU Session is carried over NR satellite access or satellite backhaul, the PCF may take this information into account for the policy decision, e.g. together with any delay requirements provided by the AF.\nWhen SMF indicates that the dynamic satellite backhaul is used to serve the PDU Session, the PCF, based on local policy, may use QoS monitoring (as described in clause 6.1.3.21) to get reports for the packet delay (defined in clause 5.45.2 of TS 23.501 [2]). The PCF may take this reported packet delay information into account for the policy decision along with other criteria, such as the AF requested QoS requirements.",

The PCC rules may restrict what traffic is allowed compared to what is explicitly signalled to the UE. The PCF may, per service data flow filter, indicate that the SMF is required to explicitly signal the corresponding traffic mapping information to the UE, e.g. for the purpose of IMS precondition handling at the UE. In absence of that indication, it is an SMF decision whether to signal the traffic mapping information that is redundant from a traffic mapping point of view.\nFor QoS Flow for services with no uplink IP flows, there is no need to provide any UL filter to the UE that effectively disallows any useful packet flows in uplink direction.\nThe default QoS rule will either contain a Packet Filter Set that allows all UL packets or a Packet Filter Set that is generated from the UL SDF filters (and from the DL SDF filters if they are available) which have an indication to signal corresponding traffic mapping information to the UE.\nNOTE:\tIf multiple PCC rules with an indication to signal corresponding traffic mapping information to the UE are bound to the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule, it is up to SMF implementation which one will be chosen to generate the default QoS rule.

The serving network may be either a PLMN or a SNPN. Emergency services are network services provided through an Emergency DNN and may not require a subscription depending on operator policies and local regulatory requirements. For emergency services, the architecture for the non-roaming case is the only applicable architecture model.\nFor emergency services, the N36 reference point does not apply. Emergency services are handled locally in the serving network.\nFor a PDU Session serving an IMS emergency session, the PCF makes authorization and policy decisions that restrict the traffic to emergency destinations, IMS signalling and the traffic to retrieve user location information (in the user plane) for emergency services. A PDU Session serving an IMS emergency session shall not serve any other service and shall not be converted to/from any PDU Session serving other services. The PCF shall determine based on the DNN if a PDU Session concerns an IMS emergency session.\nThe PCC Rule Authorization function selects QoS parameters that allow prioritization of IMS Emergency sessions. If an IMS Emergency session is prioritized the QoS parameters in the PCC Rule shall contain an ARP value that is reserved for intra-operator use of IMS Emergency services. The PCF does not perform subscription check; instead it utilizes the locally configured operator policies to make authorization and policy decisions.\nNOTE 1: Reserved value range for intra-operator use is defined in TS 23.501 [2].\nFor an emergency DNN, the PCF does not perform subscription check; instead it utilizes the locally configured operator policies to make authorization and policy decisions.\nIt shall be possible for the PCF to verify that the IMS service information is associated with a UE IP address belonging to an emergency DNN.

Dynamic invocation for MPS provided from an AF using the Priority indicator over N5/Npcf takes precedence over the MPS subscription.\nARP and/or 5QI may be modified. It shall be possible to override the default Priority Level associated with the standardized 5QI.\nFor dynamic invocation of MPS service, the PCF shall generate the corresponding PCC rule(s) with the ARP and 5QI parameters as appropriate for the prioritized service, as defined in TS 23.501 [2].\nWhenever one or more AF sessions of an MPS service are active within the same PDU Session, the PCF shall ensure that the ARP priority level of the QoS Flow for signalling as well as the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule is at least as high as the highest ARP priority level used by any authorized PCC rule belonging to an MPS service. If the ARP pre-emption capability is enabled for any of the authorized PCC rules belonging to an MPS service, the PCF shall also enable the ARP pre-emption capability for the QoS Flow for signalling as well as the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule.\nIn the case of IMS MPS, in addition to the above, the following QoS Flow handling applies:\n-\tAt reception of the indication from subscription information that the IMS Signalling Priority is set for the PDU Session or at reception of service authorization from the P-CSCF (AF) including an MPS session indication and the service priority level as defined in TS 23.228 [5], the PCF shall (under consideration of the requirement described in clauses 5.16.5 and 5.22.3 in TS 23.501 [2]) modify the ARP in all the PCC rules that describe the IMS signalling traffic to the value appropriate for IMS Multimedia Priority Services, if upgrade of the QoS Flow carrying IMS Signalling is required. To modify the ARP of the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule the PCF shall modify the Authorized default 5QI/ARP.\n-\tWhen the PCF detects that the P-CSCF (AF) released all the MPS sessions and the IMS Signalling Priority is not set for the PDU Session the PCF shall consider changes of the requirement described in clauses 5.16.5 and 5.22.3 in TS 23.501 [2] and modify the ARP in all PCC rules that describe the IMS signalling traffic to an appropriate value according to PCF decision. The PCC rules bound to the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule have to be changed accordingly.\nNOTE 1:\tTo keep the PCC rules bound to this QoS Flow, the PCF can either modify the ARP of these PCC rules accordingly or set the Bind to QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule.\nThe Priority PDU connectivity service targets the ARP and/or 5QI of the QoS Flows, enabling the prioritization of all traffic on the same QoS Flow.\nFor non-MPS service, the PCF shall generate the corresponding PCC rule(s) as per normal procedures (i.e. without consideration whether the MPS Priority PDU connectivity service is active or not), and shall upgrade the ARP/5QI values suitable for MPS when the Priority PDU connectivity service is invoked. When the Priority PDU connectivity service is revoked, the PCF shall change the ARP/5QI values modified for the Priority PDU connectivity service to appropriate values according to PCF decision.\nThe PCF shall, at the activation of the Priority PDU connectivity service:\n-\tmodify the ARP of PCC rules installed before the activation of the Priority PDU connectivity service to the ARP as appropriate for the Priority PDU connectivity service under consideration of the requirement described in clause 5.16.5 of TS 23.501 [2]; and\n-\tif modification of the 5QI of the PCC rule(s) is required, modify the 5QI of the PCC rules installed before the activation of the Priority PDU connectivity service to the 5QI as appropriate for this service.\nThe PCF shall, at the deactivation of the Priority PDU connectivity service modify any 5QI and ARP value to the value according to the PCF policy decision.\nFor PCC rules modified due to the activation of Priority PDU connectivity service:\n-\tmodify the ARP to an appropriate value according to PCF decision under consideration of the requirement described in clauses 5.16.5 and 5.22.3 in TS 23.501 [2]; and\n-\tif modification of the 5QI of PCC rule(s) is required, modify the 5QI to an appropriate value according to PCF decision.\nMPS for Data Transport Service enables the prioritization of all traffic on the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule and other QoS Flows upon AF request. The QoS modification to the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule and other QoS Flows is done based on operator policy and regulatory rules by means of local PCF configuration.\nNOTE 2:\tIf no configuration is provided, MPS for Data Transport Service applies only to the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule.\nUpon receipt of an MPS for Data Transport Service invocation/revocation request from the UE, the AF or the PCF authorizes the request. If the UE has an MPS subscription, MPS for Data Transport Service is authorized by the AF or the PCF, based on AF decision. If the Service User is using a UE that does not have an MPS subscription, the AF authorizes MPS for Data Transport Service:\n-\tIn the case that the AF authorizes the MPS for Data Transport Service request, after successful authorization, the AF sends the MPS for Data Transport Service request to the PCF over N5/Npcf for QoS Flow modifications, including an indication that PCF authorization is not needed. In this case, the PCF shall not perform any MPS subscription check for the MPS for Data Transport Service request. The AF also indicates to the PCF whether the request is for invoking or revoking MPS for Data Transport Service.\n-\tIn the case that the AF does not authorize the MPS for Data Transport Service request, the AF sends the request to the PCF over N5/Npcf for authorization and QoS Flow modifications, including an indication that PCF authorization is needed. In this case, the PCF shall perform an MPS subscription check for the MPS for Data Transport Service request. The AF also indicates whether the request is for invoking or revoking MPS for Data Transport Service. The PCF will inform the AF when the UE does not have an MPS subscription associated with the request.\nAfter successful authorization by either AF or PCF as described above, the PCF shall, at the invocation/revocation of MPS for Data Transport Service, perform the same steps for QoS modifications as described above for the activation/deactivation of the Priority PDU connectivity service.\nNOTE 3:\tTo keep the PCC rules bound to the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS Rule, the PCF can either modify the ARP/QCI of these PCC rules accordingly or set the PCC rule attribute Bind to QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule.\nThe PCF shall inform the AF of the success or failure of the MPS for Data Transport Service invocation/revocation request. If the PDU Session is deactivated for other reasons that an AF request, the PCF shall notify the AF by deleting the N5 session context.\nFor MPS for Data Transport Service, the AF may also request an SDF for priority signalling between the UE and the AF, where the AF includes the Priority indicator over N5/Npcf, in order to enable the PCF to set appropriate QoS values for the QoS Flow.",

For MCPTT, the service priority and the priority sharing indicator are defined in TS 23.179 [6]. The priority sharing indicator is used to indicate what media flows are allowed to share priority.\nThe PCF makes authorization and policy decisions for the affected AF sessions individually and generates a PCC rule for every media flow as specified in clause 6.1.1.3.

      "content": "This feature, when activated by the user, prevents traffics via 3GPP access except for 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services. The 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services are a set of operator services, defined in TS 22.011 [15] and TS 23.221 [16], that are the only allowed services in both downlink and uplink direction when the 3GPP PS Data Off feature has been activated by the user.\nWhen PCF is deployed, it shall be able to configure the list(s) of 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services for 3GPP access, and the Policy Control Request Trigger of 3GPP PS Data Off status change used to inform the PCF from SMF about every change of the 3GPP PS Data Off status.\nNOTE 1:\tThe PCF can be configured with a list(s) of 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services per DNN. The list(s) of 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services for an DNN can also be empty, or can allow for any service within that DNN, according to operator policy.\nNOTE 2:\tFor the PDU Session used for IMS services, the 3GPP Data Off Exempt Services are enforced in the IMS domain as specified TS 23.228 [5]. Policies configured in the PCF need to ensure that IMS services are allowed when the 3GPP Data Off status of the UE is set to \"activated\", e.g. by treating any service within a well-known IMS DNN as 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services.\nWhen the PCF is informed about the activation of 3GPP PS Data Off, it shall update the PCC rules in such a way that for 3GPP access only packets for services belonging to the list(s) of 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services are forwarded while all other packets are discarded. Packets sent over non-3GPP access are not affected, and in the case of MA PDU Session, this is ensured by the MA PDU Session Control policy, e.g. for packets not belonging to the 3GPP Data Off Exempt Services, PCF provides PCC rule containing Steering Mode \"Active-Standby\" with active access as non-3GPP access and no standby access for downlink and uplink direction.\nNOTE 3:\tFor non MA PDU Sessions, in order for the SMF/UPF to prevent the services that do not belong to the list(s) of 3GPP PS Data Off Exempted Services, if the services are controlled by dynamic PCC rules, the PCF could modify the PCC rules by setting the gate status to \"closed\" for downlink and optionally uplink direction in all active dynamic PCC rules or remove those dynamic PCC rules. If the services are controlled by predefined PCC rules, the PCF can deactivate those predefined PCC rules. PCC rule with wild-carded service data flow filters can be among the PCC rules that are modified, removed or deactivated in that manner. In this case, it can be necessary that the PCF at the same time installs or activates PCC rules for data-off exempt services.\nNOTE 4:\tFor example, for non MA PDU Sessions, four PCC rules (A, B, C, D) are active for a PDU Session with PCC rule A representing a 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Service. When 3GPP PS Data Off is activated, the PCF could either modify PCC rules B, C and D if they are dynamic PCC rules by closing the gate in downlink and optionally uplink direction or remove/deactivate PCC rules B, C and D if they are predefined PCC rules. PCC rule A does not need to be changed as it represents 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Service. Assuming that PCC rule B contained wild-carded service data flow filters which has enabled some 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Service is removed or deactivated, an additional PCC rule E can be installed or activated as well to enable downlink and optionally uplink traffic for that 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Service.\nNOTE 5:\tThe network configuration can ensure that at least one PCC Rule is activated for the PDU Session when Data Off is activated in order to avoid deletion of an existing PDU Session or in order not to fail a PDU Session establishment.\nWhen the PCF receives service information from the AF, in addition to what is specified in clause 6.2.1, PCF shall check if the requested service information belongs to the 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services. If the requested service belongs to 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services or if the service traffic can be sent over non-3GPP access, PCF shall continue as specified in clause 6.2.1. If the requested service doesn't belong to the 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services and the PDU Session is established only over 3GPP access, PCF shall reject the service request.\nWhen the PCF is informed about the deactivation of 3GPP PS Data Off, it shall perform policy control decision as specified in clause 6.2.1 and perform PCC rule operations as specified in clause 6.3.2 to make sure that the services are allowed according to user's subscription and operator policy (irrespective of whether they belong to the list(s) of 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services).\nWhen PCF is not deployed, predefined PCC rules, can be configured in the SMF, on a per DNN basis, to ensure the following:\n-\twhen the SMF is informed about activation of 3GPP PS Data Off, the SMF shall update the predefined PCC rule in a way that for 3GPP access only downlink and optionally uplink packets for services belonging to the list(s) of 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services are forwarded while all other downlink and uplink packets are discarded. Packets sent over non-3GPP access are not affected, and in the case of MA PDU Session, this is ensured by the MA PDU Session Control policy, e.g. for packets not belonging to the 3GPP Data Off Exempt Services, the SMF applies predefined PCC rule containing Steering Mode \"Active-Standby\" with active access as non-3GPP access and no standby access for downlink and uplink direction; and\n-\tWhen SMF is informed about deactivation of 3GPP PS Data Off, the SMF ensures in UPF downlink and uplink packets are forwarded according to the operator policy for the subscriber.\nNOTE 6:\tFor example, for non MA PDU Sessions the SMF can be configured with two sets of predefined PCC rules: one set for UE 3GPP PS Data Off status \"inactive\" and another set for UE 3GPP PS Data Off status \"active\". The set of predefined PCC rules for UE 3GPP PS Data Off status \"active\" can be equivalent to the set of predefined PCC rules for UE with 3GPP PS Data Off status \"inactive\" with the following two differences: All services belonging to the list(s) of 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services can be represented by PCC rule(s) which allows the traffic to pass while in all other PCC rules (not belonging to the list(s) of 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services) the gate status can be \"closed\" for downlink and optionally uplink direction. When the SMF is informed about the change of UE 3GPP PS Data Off status, it can replace the currently active set of predefined PCC rules with the other set of predefined PCC rules.\nWhen the UE 3GPP PS Data Off status is \"active\" and a handover from one access-system to another occurs, the PCF or the SMF when PCF is not deployed performs the above operations so that the downlink and optionally uplink traffic for services not belonging to the list(s) of 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services is only prevented via the 3GPP access.",

The Conditions for reporting column indicates the respective consumer.\nNOTE 7:\tThe PCF for the UE subscribes to this Event indirectly via AMF and SMF.\nNOTE 8:\tSubscription to this event is performed implicitly when AF provides the ECN marking for L4S support indication.\nNOTE 9:\tThe PCF for the UE subscribes to this Event to PCF for the PDU Session.\nIf an AF requests the PCF to report the PLMN identifier where the UE is currently located, then the PCF shall provide the PLMN identifier or the SNPN identifier to the AF if available. Otherwise, the PCF shall provision the corresponding PCC rules, and the Policy Control Request Trigger to report PLMN change to the SMF. The PCF shall, upon receiving the PLMN identifier or the SNPN identifier from the SMF forward this information to the AF, including the PLMN Id and if available the NID. If the H-PCF requests to report the PLMN identifier where the UE is currently located, the V-PCF provisions the PCRT on \"PLMN change\" to the AMF as described in clause 6.1.2.5 and then forwards the PLMN ID received from the AMF to the H-PCF.\nIf an AF requests the PCF to report on the change of Access Type, the PCF shall provide the corresponding Policy Control Request Trigger to the SMF to enable the report of the Change in Access Type to the PCF. The PCF shall, upon reception of information about the Access Type the user is currently using and upon indication of change of Access Type, notify the AF on changes of the Access Type and forward the information received from the SMF to the AF. The change of the RAT Type shall also be reported to the AF, even if the Access Type is unchanged. For MA PDU Session the Access Type information may include two Access Type information that the user is currently using.\nIf an AF requests the PCF to report on the signalling path status, for the AF session, the PCF shall, upon indication of removal of PCC Rules identifying signalling traffic from the SMF report it to the AF.\nIf an AF requests the PCF to report Access Network Charging Correlation Information, the PCF shall provide to the AF the Access Network Charging Correlation Information, which allows to identify the usage reports that include measurements for the Service Data Flow(s), once the Access Network Charging Correlation Information is known at the PCF.\nIf an AF requests the PCF to report Access Network Information (i.e. the User Location Report and/or the UE Timezone Report) at AF session establishment, modification or termination, the PCF shall set the Access Network Information report parameters in the corresponding PCC rule(s) and provision them together with the corresponding Policy Control Request Trigger to the SMF. For those PCC rule(s) based on preliminary service information the PCF may assign the 5QI and ARP of the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule to avoid signalling to the UE.\nNOTE 1:\tThe PCF can also use the dynamic or pre-defined PCC Rules related to the IMS signalling to request Access Network Information reporting. This can be used to support e.g. regulatory requirements for SMS over IP, where the IMS network (i.e. P‑CSCF) needs to retrieve the user location and/or UE Time Zone information. Note that due to regulatory requirements, the Access Network Information can be requested for SMS over IP, impacting a large number of PDU Sessions, that can lead to significant increase in signalling load when the Access Network Information is requested from AMF.\nThe PCF shall, upon receiving an Access Network Information report corresponding to the AF session from the SMF, forward the Access Network Information as requested by the AF (if the SMF only reported the serving PLMN identifier or the SNPN identifier to the PCF, as described in clause 6.1.3.5, the PCF shall forward it to the AF). For AF session termination the communication between the AF and the PCF shall be kept alive until the PCF report is received.\nIf an AF requests the PCF to report the Usage for Sponsored Data Connectivity, the PCF shall provision the corresponding PCC rules, and the Policy Control Request Trigger to the SMF. If the usage threshold provided by the AF has been reached or the AF session is terminated, the PCF forwards such information to the AF.\nIf an AF or TSCTSF requests the PCF to report the Service Data Flow deactivation, the PCF shall report the release of resources corresponding to the AF session. The PCF shall, upon being notified of the removal of PCC Rules corresponding to the AF session from the SMF, forward this information to the AF. The PCF shall also forward, if available, the reason why the resources are released, the user location information and the UE Timezone.\nIf an AF or TSCTSF requests the PCF to report the Resource allocation outcome, the PCF shall report the outcome of the resource allocation of the Service Data Flow(s) related to the AF session. The AF or TSCTSF may request to be notified about successful or failed resource allocation. In this case, the PCF shall instruct the SMF to report the successful resource allocation trigger (see clause 6.1.3.5). If the SMF has notified the PCF that the resource allocation of a Service Data Flow is successful and the currently fulfilled QoS matches an Alternative QoS parameter set (as described in clause 6.2.2.1), the PCF shall also provide to the AF the QoS Reference parameter or the Requested Alternative QoS Parameter Set which corresponds to the Alternative QoS parameter set referenced by the SMF. If the SMF has notified the PCF about resource allocation failure together with an Access Type (as described in clause 6.1.3.5), the PCF shall only notify the AF when the PCC rule is removed and without forwarding any Access Type information. If the SMF has notified the PCF about resource allocation failure due to UE temporary unreachable together with a maximum waiting time, if available, (as described in clause 6.1.3.5), the PCF shall notify the AF on resource allocation failure and provide the UE temporary unreachable and the maximum waiting time, if available.\nIf an AF requests the PCF to report when the QoS targets can no longer (or can again) be fulfilled for a particular media flow, the PCF shall set the QNC indication in the corresponding PCC rule(s) that includes a GBR or delay critical GBR 5QI value and provision them together with the corresponding Policy Control Request Trigger to the SMF. At the time, the SMF notifies that GFBR can no longer (or can again) be guaranteed for a QoS Flow to which those PCC Rule(s) are bound, the PCF shall report to the AF the affected media flow and provides the indication that QoS targets can no longer (or can again) be fulfilled. If additional information is received with the notification from SMF (see clause 5.7.2.4 of TS 23.501 [2]), the PCF shall also provide to the AF the QoS Reference parameter or the Requested Alternative QoS Parameter Set which corresponds to the Alternative QoS parameter set referenced by the SMF. If the SMF has indicated that the lowest priority Alternative QoS parameter set cannot be fulfilled, the PCF shall indicate to the AF that the lowest priority QoS Reference or the lowest priority set of Requested Alternative QoS Parameters of the Alternative Service Requirements cannot be fulfilled.\nIf the AF subscribes to be notified of the QoS Monitoring reports, the PCF decides about the path for the QoS Monitoring reports and sets the QoS Monitoring Policy Control Request Trigger accordingly, as described in clause 6.1.3.21. The PCF sends the QoS Monitoring reports to AF based on the QoS Monitoring reports that it receives from the SMF, according to AF subscription and PCF selected notification path e.g. PCF does not report to AF if AF will receive the QoS Monitoring reports directly from the UPF.\nNOTE 2:\tThe QoS Monitoring report received by the PCF and the information sent to the AF can be different. The QoS Monitoring report (e.g. packer delay) may be used by PCF to calculate the requested QoS parameter (e.g. packet delay variation).\nNOTE 3:\tThis event can only be subscribed as part of an AF session with required QoS (described in clause 6.1.3.22) and as part of AF requested QoS for a UE or group of UEs not identified by a UE address (described in clause 6.1.3.28).\nNOTE 4:\tIf the service data flow is mapped to two QoS Flows (i.e. the UL traffic and DL traffic of the service data flow are separated into two QoS Flows respectively) in the same PDU Session, the PCF triggers QoS Monitoring for each direction packet delay of the individual QoS Flows respectively and generates the QoS Monitoring reports for the AF based on the packet delay monitored on the QoS Flow for each direction (as described in clause 5.37.4 of TS 23.501 [2]).\nIf the AF subscribes to be notified of Packet Delay Variation reports (the variation of UL/DL packet delay between UE and PSA UPF), the PCF triggers the QoS monitoring procedure, derives the 5GS Packet Delay Variation and reports the value to the AF, as described in clause 6.1.3.26.\nNOTE 5:\tThis event can only be subscribed as part of an AF session with required QoS (described in clause 6.1.3.22).\nIf the AF subscribes to Round-trip delay measurement over two service data flows considering the UL direction of a service data flows and the DL direction of another service data flow, PCF triggers the QoS monitoring procedure to derive the Round-Trip delay measurement for delay measurements on the individual QoS Flows respectively (as described in clause 6.1.3.27.1 and in clause 5.37.4 of TS 23.501 [2]. The PCF derives the Round-Trip delay based on the packet delay measurement reports of the QoS Flows of each direction and reports the results to the AF. PCF sets QoS Monitoring Policies for each of the individual service data flows and QoS Monitoring Policy Control Request Trigger as described in clause 6.1.3.21.\nNOTE 6:\tThis event can only be subscribed as part of an AF session with required QoS (described in clause 6.1.3.22).\nIf the AF indicates ECN marking for L4S support by the application, PCF authorizes the request and sets the ECN marking for L4S can no longer (or can again) be performed trigger accordingly. PCF shall further send the notification it receives from the SMF to AF on whether the network can not (or can again) perform ECN marking for L4S, for example, if due to user mobility neither target RAN nor UPF PSA support ECN marking for L4S.\nIf an AF requests the PCF to report on the Out of credit event for the associated service data flow(s), the PCF shall inform the AF (when it gets informed by the SMF) that credit is no longer available for the services data flow(s) related to the AF session together with the applied termination action.\nIf an AF requests the PCF to report on the Reallocation of credit event for the associated service data flow(s), the PCF shall inform the AF (when it gets informed by the SMF) that credit has been reallocated after credit was no longer available and the termination action was applied for the service data flow(s) related to the AF session.\nThe PCF can arm the trigger of 5GS Bridge/Router information available to SMF based on local policy (i.e. without an AF request) or based on subscription request from TSCTSF. The PCF shall, upon reception of the 5GS Bridge/Router information (refer to clauses 6.1.3.23, 6.1.3.23a, 6.1.3.23b) from the SMF, forward this information to the TSN AF or the TSCTSF. When the PCF has received the User plane node Management Information Container or Port Management Information Container and related port number from SMF, the PCF also provides User plane node Management Information Container or Port Management Information Container and related port number to the TSN AF or TSCTSF. When SMF has reported the 5GS Bridge/Router information and no AF session exists, the PCF forward this information to a pre-configured TSN AF, or to a pre-configured TSCTSF or a TSCTSF discovered and selected via NRF. In the case of private IPv4 address being used for IP type PDU Session, the PCF shall additionally report DNN and S-NSSAI of the PDU Session to TSCTSF.\nIf the AF requests the PCF to report on the outcome of the service area coverage change, the PCF reports the outcome of the service area coverage change to the AF and notifies the current service area coverage to the AF. The outcome is the result of the execution of the request of service coverage change at the PCF; the outcome is successful if the request was executed, and includes the current service area coverage that may be the same or different from the service area coverage provided by the AF. The subscription may also be implicit. In this case there may be bulk subscription, either for an Internal-Group-Id or for any UE. In order to prevent massive notifications to the AF, the request for any UE is associated to a specific Application Identifier or DNN, S-NSSAI. For bulk subscription, when the AF request includes an expiration time, the PCF stops reporting to the AF when the expiration time is reached.\nIf the AF requests the (H-)PCF, via V-PCF when roaming, to report on the outcome of the UE Policies delivery due to service specific parameter provisioning procedure, the (H-)PCF reports the outcome of the related UE Policies provisioning procedure for the related traffic descriptor for the UE to the AF, via V-PCF when roaming. The outcome of the UE Policies provisioning procedure includes the success, the failure with an appropriate cause or the interim status report such as the UE is temporarily unreachable or that URSP Rules have not yet been delivered by the H-PCF (see clauses 4.15.6.7 and 5.2.5.7 of TS 23.502 [3]). The PCF reports the outcome of the UE Policy provisioning procedure for each of the UEs that were included as Target UEs in the service specific information Data Subset in UDR. When the AF requested the PCF for the UE to report on the outcome of the UE Policies delivery due to service specific parameter provisioning procedure targeting a single UE, the Result of UE Policy Container delivery via EPS event trigger shall be subscribed.\nNOTE 7:\tAn example reason for sending an interim status report that indicates that \"URSP Rules have not yet been delivered by the H-PCF\" may be that the UE does not support the VPLMN Specific URSP Rules feature and is not registered in the PLMN where the service parameters apply.\nA request to report Start of application traffic detection and Stop of application traffic detection triggers the reporting when the PCF receives start of application traffic detection event or stop of application traffic detection event from SMF. The reception of a subscription to this event triggers the setting of the corresponding Policy Control Request Trigger to SMF, if not already subscribed.\nA request to forward UE reporting Connection Capabilities from an associated URSP rule triggers the reporting when the PCF receives UE reporting of URSP rule enforcement information from the SMF matching specific Connection Capabilities (see clause 6.6.2.4). The request may include SUPI(s), DNN(s) and/or S-NSSAI(s) to which the request applies. The PCF reports the received Connection Capabilities and PDU Session information including the SUPI, UE requested DNN, Selected DNN, S-NSSAI, SSC Mode, PDU Session Type.\nIf an AF requests the PCF to report Start of application traffic detection and Stop of application traffic detection via bulk subscription, the AF shall provide the application identifier together with the S-NSSAI and DNN. The PCF provides a PCC rule for the application identifier together with the corresponding Policy Control Request Trigger to the SMF for every PDU Session to this S-NSSAI and DNN. When the PCF receives start of application traffic detection event or stop of application traffic detection event for the PCC rule in a PDU Session, the PCF forwards the event to the AF together with the UE identifier and optionally the IP address of the PDU Session corresponding to this PCC rule. When the AF removes bulk subscription for this application identifier, then the PCF removes the Policy Control Request Trigger from the SMF for every PDU Session to this S-NSSAN and DNN, if it is not used for other purpose.\nNOTE 8:\tThe restriction of the bulk subscription to a specific combination of S-NSSAI and DNN avoids excessive signalling load.\nIf an AF requests the PCF to report on the change between different types of satellite backhaul or the change between satellite backhaul and non-satellite backhaul (as specified in clause 5.43.4 of TS 23.501 [2]), the PCF shall provide the corresponding Policy Control Request Trigger to the SMF to enable the report of satellite backhaul category change (see clause 6.1.3.5) to the PCF. The PCF shall, upon reception of information about the change of Satellite backhaul category, notify the AF on the Satellite backhaul category change event was met and forward the current Satellite backhaul category received from the SMF to the AF. When the satellite backhaul is no longer used, the Satellite backhaul category indicates that a non-satellite backhaul is used.\nIf 5G DDNMF requests the PCF to report on the Change of PDUID, the PCF shall notify whenever a new PDUID is allocated. Further details on how the 5G DDNMF retrieves and subscribes to notifications on Change of PDUID are defined in TS 23.304 [34].\nA request to report SM Policy Association established or terminated triggers an implicit subscription and the reporting to the PCF for the UE when the PCF for the PDU Session receives PCF binding information together with Request for notification of SM Policy Association establishment and termination from the SMF. The PCF for the PDU Session derives the PCF for the UE from the PCF binding information and then notifies the PCF for the UE on this event including the PCF binding information of the PCF for the PDU Session.\nIf the TSCTSF requests the PCF notifications for reporting of extra UE addresses, the PCF shall provide the extra UE addresses allocated to the PDU Session due to Framed Routes or IPv6 prefix delegation. The report shall include the actual list of IPv4 address masks or a list of IPv6 prefixes as currently allocated.\nIf the AF provides the Capability for BAT adaptation or BAT Window and subscribes to PCF for Notification on BAT offset, the PCF will trigger the subscription to SMF for Notification on BAT offset defined in clause 6.1.3.5. When the Notification on BAT offset trigger is set and the PCF receives a BAT offset and optionally an adjusted periodicity from the SMF, the PCF identifies the affected AF session (based on the PCC rule indicated by the SMF) and forwards the BAT offset and optionally the adjusted periodicity for this AF session to the TSCTSF.\nA request to report Result of UE Policy Container delivery via EPS triggers the reporting when the PCF for the PDU Session receives the UE Policy Container from the UE during UE Policy Container delivery via EPS, or a delivery failure result for UE Policy Container delivery via EPS with appropriate reason from the SMF. The reception of a subscription to this event triggers the setting of the corresponding Policy Control Request Trigger to SMF, if not already subscribed.\nIf an AF requests the PCF to report on the UE reachability status change, the PCF shall provide the corresponding Policy Control Request Trigger to the SMF to enable the report of the UE reachability status change to the PCF, if not already subscribed. The PCF shall, upon indication of change of reachability status, notify the AF and forward the information received from the SMF to the AF.",

      "content": "As specified in TS 23.501 [2], the Access Traffic Steering, Switching and Splitting (ATSSS) feature is an optional feature that may be supported by the UE and the 5GC network.\nThe ATSSS feature enables a multi-access PDU Connectivity Service, which can exchange PDUs between the UE and a data network by simultaneously using one 3GPP access network and one non-3GPP access network (both connected to 5GC) when both accesses are allowed for the same S-NSSAI. The multi-access PDU Connectivity Service also supports the exchange of PDUs between the UE and a data network by simultaneously using one 3GPP access network in EPC and one non-3GPP access network in 5GC, or one 3GPP access network in 5GC and one non-3GPP access network in EPC, as described in TS 23.501 [2]. This enables a scenario where a MA PDU Session can simultaneously be associated with user-plane resources on 3GPP access network connected to 5GC or EPC and non-3GPP access connected to 5GC, or with user-plane resources on 3GPP access network connected to 5GC and non-3GPP access connected to EPC.\nThe PCF is informed of the ATSSS capabilities of a MA PDU Session by the SMF, as defined in clause 5.32.2 of TS 23.501 [2]. The ATSSS capabilities are both the Steering Mode and the Steering Functionality.\nThe PCF control of Access Traffic Steering, Switching and Splitting for a detected service data flow (SDF) is enabled by including Multi-Access PDU (MA PDU) Session Control information in the PCC rule. This allows the PCF to control:\n-\tThe Steering Mode that is used to steer/switch/split the detected SDF. The available Steering Modes are defined in TS 23.501 [2].\n-\tThe Steering Functionality that is used for the detected SDF, e.g. the MPTCP functionality or the ATSSS-LL functionality or the MPQUIC functionality defined in TS 23.501 [2].\n-\tThe Steering Mode Indicator authorized for the detected SDF.\n-\tThe Threshold values for RTT and Packet Loss Rate authorized for the detected SDF.\n-\tThe Charging information depending on what Access Type is used for a detected SDF.\n-\tThe Usage Monitoring information depending on what Access Type is used for a detected SDF.\n-\tTransport Mode that is used for the detected SDF. The available Transport Modes are defined in TS 23.501 [2].\nThe rest of the information in the PCC Rule apply to the SDF as such and are not dependent on what Access Type is used for a packet.\nThe MA PDU Session Control information in the PCC rules is used by the SMF in order to create applicable N4 rules for the UPF and ATSSS rules for the UE, as described in TS 23.501 [2]. The ATSSS rules are sent to UE via NAS when the MA PDU Session is created or updated by the SMF/PCF, as described in TS 23.501 [2] and TS 23.502 [3].\nWhen MA PDU Session Control Information is provided to the SMF within a PCC Rule, the (H-)PCF provides both the Service Data Flow templates to identify a Service Data Flow in the UPF and if the Service Data Flow template includes an application identifier, then the corresponding Application descriptors to identify the application traffic in the UE is also included.\nThe (H-) PCF may use the OSid stored in the UDR as DataSet \"Policy Data\" and Data Subset \"UE context policy control data\" to determine the OSAppId supported by the OSid. The (H-)PCF may also provide multiple Application descriptors to identify application traffic in the UE, this is determined by the (H-)PCF local policies that indicates e.g. the operating system supported by the UE. If no OSid is available in the UDR, the (H-)PCF may use the PEI to determine the OSid supported by the UE.\nNOTE 1:\tIf the (H-)PCF does not take into account the received PEI and/or OSId then the (H-)PCF can send PCC rules containing application traffic descriptors associated to multiple operating systems.\nThe Traffic Descriptor in the ATSSS rule is generated by the SMF from the SDF template of the PCC rule. If the SDF template contains SDF filters, the SMF uses the UL SDF filters for the generation of the IP descriptors or Non-IP descriptors, respectively. If the SDF template contains an application identifier, the SMF includes the Application descriptors received from the PCF as part of the MA PDU Session information in the PCC Rule within the Traffic Descriptors in the ATSSS rule.\nFor the Load-Balancing steering mode with fixed split percentages (i.e. without the Autonomous load-balance indicator or UE-assistance indicator), the PCF may provide one or more threshold values together with the split percentages. For the Priority-based steering mode, the PCF may provide one or more threshold values together with the priority of the accesses. For the Redundant steering mode, the PCF may provide one threshold value and/or a primary access. For the Load-Balancing and the Priority-based steering mode, one threshold value for the Round Trip Time (RTT) and/or one threshold value for the Packet Loss Rate (PLR) may be included in a PCC Rule. For the Redundant steering mode, either one threshold value for the Round Trip Time (RTT) or one threshold value for the Packet Loss Rate (PLR) may be included in a PCC Rule based on local configuration or QoS requirements received from AF as specified in clause 4.15.6.6 or clause 4.15.6.6a of TS 23.502 [3]. The threshold values are not dependent on what Access Type is used for a packet, i.e. a given threshold value is applicable to both accesses. The threshold values are applied by the UE and UPF as described in TS 23.501 [2].\nNOTE 2:\tThe Round Trip Time (RTT) threshold value can be determined based on the PDB of the 5QI authorized for the SDF, and the Packet Loss Rate (PLR) threshold value can be determined based on the PER of the 5QI authorized for the SDF.\nThe MA PDU Session Control information in a PCC rule may contain only one of the following Steering Mode Indicators:\n-\tAutonomous load-balance indicator: This indicator may be included only when the Steering Mode is Load-Balancing and indicates whether autonomous load-balance operation is allowed. Further details are specified in clause 5.32.8 of TS 23.501 [2].\n-\tUE-assistance indicator: It indicates that the UE can decide how to distribute the UL traffic based on its internal state (e.g. battery level), and that the UE can request from UPF to apply the same distribution for the DL traffic. Further details are specified in clause 5.32.8 of TS 23.501 [2].\nThe PCF may also provide URSP rules to the UE for instructing the UE to establish a MA PDU Session, as described in clause 6.6.2.\nThe PCF control of PDU Session level Usage Monitoring depending on what access type is used to carry the traffic is enabled by providing Usage Monitoring control related information per access in the PDU Session related policy control information (as described in clause 6.4).\nThe Transport Mode may be included in a PCC rule that is used for the detected SDF only when the Steering functionality is the MPQUIC functionality.\nIf the MA PDU Session is capable of supporting one of the following:\n-\tMPTCP and ATSSS-LL with any Steering Mode (i.e. any Steering Mode allowed for ATSSS-LL) in the downlink and MPTCP and ATSSS-LL with Active-Standby in the uplink;\n-\tMPQUIC and ATSSS-LL with any Steering Mode (i.e. any Steering Mode allowed for ATSSS-LL) in the downlink and MPQUIC and ATSSS-LL with Active-Standby in the uplink;\n-\tMPTCP, MPQUIC and ATSSS-LL with any Steering Mode (i.e. any Steering Mode allowed for ATSSS-LL) in the downlink and MPTCP, MPQUIC and ATSSS-LL with Active-Standby in the uplink,\nthen the PCF shall provide a PCC Rule for \"match all\" traffic. This PCC Rule contains a \"match all\" SDF template, the lowest precedence, the Steering Functionality set to \"ATSSS-LL\" and the Steering Mode set to \"Active-Standby\" for the uplink direction, and the Steering Functionality set to \"ATSSS-LL\" and the Steering Mode set to any supported steering mode (i.e. any Steering Mode allowed for ATSSS-LL) for the downlink direction.\nIf the MA PDU Session is capable of supporting one of the following:\n-\tMPTCP with any Steering Mode in the downlink, ATSSS-LL with any steering mode except Smallest Delay steering mode and Redundant steering mode in the downlink, and MPTCP and ATSSS-LL with Active-Standby in the uplink;\n-\tMPQUIC with any Steering Mode in the downlink, ATSSS-LL with any steering mode except Smallest Delay steering mode and Redundant steering mode in the downlink, and MPQUIC and ATSSS-LL with Active-Standby in the uplink;\n-\tBoth MPTCP and MPQUIC with any Steering Mode in the downlink, ATSSS-LL with any steering mode except Smallest Delay steering mode and Redundant steering mode in the downlink, and MPTCP, MPQUIC and ATSSS-LL with Active-Standby in the uplink,\nthen the PCF shall provide a PCC Rule for \"match all\" traffic. This PCC Rule contains a \"match all\" SDF template, the lowest precedence, the Steering Functionality set to \"ATSSS-LL\" and the Steering Mode set to \"Active-Standby\" for the uplink direction, and the Steering Functionality set to \"ATSSS-LL\" and the Steering Mode set to any supported steering mode except Smallest Delay steering mode and Redundant steering mode for the downlink direction.\nIf the MA PDU Session is capable of supporting one of the following:\n-\tMPTCP and ATSSS-LL with Active-Standby in the uplink and downlink;\n-\tMPQUIC and ATSSS-LL with Active-Standby in the uplink and downlink;\n-\tMPTCP, MPQUIC and ATSSS-LL with Active-Standby in the uplink and downlink,\nthen the PCF shall provide a PCC Rule for \"match all\" traffic. This PCC Rule contains a \"match all\" SDF template, the lowest precedence, the Steering Functionality set to \"ATSSS-LL\" and the Steering Mode set to \"Active-Standby\" for the uplink direction and the downlink direction.\nIf the MA PDU Session is capable of supporting one of the following:\n-\tMPTCP and ATSSS-LL with any Steering Mode (i.e. any Steering Mode allowed for ATSSS-LL) in the uplink and downlink;\n-\tMPQUIC and ATSSS-LL with any Steering Mode (i.e. any Steering Mode allowed for ATSSS-LL) in the uplink and downlink;\n-\tMPTCP, MPQUIC and ATSSS-LL with any Steering Mode (i.e. any Steering Mode allowed for ATSSS-LL) in the uplink and downlink,\nthen the PCF shall provide a PCC Rule for \"match all\" traffic. This PCC Rule may contain a \"match all\" SDF template, the lowest precedence, the Steering Functionality set to \"ATSSS-LL\" and the Steering Mode set to any supported steering mode for the uplink direction and for the downlink direction (i.e. any Steering Mode allowed for ATSSS-LL).\nThe Steering functionality \"ATSSS-LL\" shall not be provided together with Steering Mode \"Redundant\".\nThese PCC Rules are used by the SMF to generate an ATSSS rule for the UE and an N4 rule for the UPF to route the \"match all\" traffic of the MA PDU Session in the uplink and downlink direction respectively.\nNOTE 3:\tThe PCF can also use the ATSSS capability of the MA PDU Session to provide PCC Rules containing SDF template for some specific non-MPTCP traffic or non-MPQUIC traffic other than the PCC Rule containing a \"match all\" SDF template. This allows the operator to apply different policies e.g. charging key to non-MPTCP traffic or non-MPQUIC traffic other than the non-MPTCP traffic or non-MPQUIC matching the \"match all\" PCC Rule.\nWhen the Redundant steering mode is used and resources are not available in one access, the SMF will notify the PCF about the resource allocation failure and indicate the respective Access Type (as described in clause 6.1.3.5). The PCF can then determine by implementation specific means how to proceed with such a GBR SDF for which redundant traffic transmission is no longer possible.\nNOTE 4:\tThe PCF can e.g. provide the PCC rule again in order to trigger another resource allocation, modify the MA PDU Session Control information in the PCC rule or remove the PCC rule (and inform the AF accordingly).",

At a given time, the PCC Rule only has one authorized QoS Monitoring policy enabling the measurement of each QoS Monitoring parameter.\nNOTE 2:\tWithin a PCC rule, each QoS Monitoring parameter can only be requested in one QoS Monitoring Policy. As an example, if a new QoS Monitoring Policy is provided for a QoS Monitoring parameter, the existing QoS Monitoring Policy for same QoS Monitoring parameter (if any) will be replaced.\nNOTE 3:\tThe AF requested QoS Monitoring parameters and the PCF requested QoS Monitoring parameters based on the AF request can be different, e.g. Packet Delay Variation and packet delay, as described in clause 6.1.3.26.\nIf the AF did not provide an indication of direct event notification in the request and the PCF may decide that it does not want to receive the QoS Monitoring reports. If so, the PCF forwards the Target of reporting parameter in the QoS Monitoring policy and the SMF shall then send the QoS Monitoring reports directly to the NF indicated by the Target of reporting parameter. If the PCF decides that it wants to receive the QoS Monitoring reports, e.g. when the AF request includes measurements that are derived by PCF, the PCF shall not forward the Target of reporting parameter in the QoS Monitoring policy and instead subscribe to receive QoS Monitoring reports from SMF by setting the QoS Monitoring Policy Control Request Trigger.\nIf the AF provided an indication of direct event notification in the request and PCF determines that the QoS Monitoring reports can be notified directly (i.e. the AF request does not include QoS Monitoring parameter measurements that are derived by PCF), the PCF forwards the Target of reporting parameter in the QoS Monitoring policy and sets the indication of direct event notification to indicate that QoS Monitoring reports have to be sent by the UPF directly to the NF indicated by the Target of reporting. The PCF may also subscribe to receive QoS Monitoring reports, by setting the QoS Monitoring Policy Control Request Trigger. In that case, the UPF is asked to duplicate the reports and the QoS Monitoring reports will be sent by the UPF to both, the NF indicated by the Target of reporting and to the SMF (which then forwards the report to the PCF).\nIf the AF provided an indication of direct event notification and PCF determines that the QoS Monitoring reports cannot be notified directly (i.e. the AF request includes QoS Monitoring parameter measurements that are derived by PCF), the PCF generates a successful response to AF and indicates that direct event notification is not possible. The PCF shall neither forward the Target of reporting parameter nor the indication of direct event notification in the QoS Monitoring policy and instead subscribe to receive QoS Monitoring reports from SMF by setting the QoS Monitoring Policy Control Request Trigger.\nNOTE 4:\tIf there are multiple QoS rules containing a QoS Monitoring policy, the PCF will receive the QoS Monitoring reports for all of them when the QoS Monitoring Policy Control Request Trigger is set.\nThe PCF includes the authorized QoS Monitoring policy in the PCC rule and provides it to the SMF. The SMF determines the configuration for the measurement of the QoS Monitoring parameters (e.g. the QoS Monitoring parameter(s) requested) from the QoS Monitoring policy in the PCC rule and requests the RAN (if necessary) and the UPF to perform the measurement of the QoS Monitoring parameters defined in clause 5.45 of TS 23.501 [2] as needed and as defined in clause 5.8.2.18 of TS 23.501 [2] and in clause 4.3.3.2 of TS 23.502 [3].\nThe PCF can be configured to include in the QoS Monitoring policy of the PCC rule a DataCollection_ApplicationIdentifier determined based on the AF request or local configuration.

If no 5QI exists that matches the individual QoS parameters, the PCF generates a new dynamically assigned 5QI based on the individual QoS parameters.\n-\tThe AF may change the QoS by providing different values for the individual QoS parameters while the AF session is ongoing. If this happens, the PCF shall update the related QoS parameter sets in the PCC rule accordingly.\n-\tThe PCF may reject the individual QoS parameters received from the AF based on operator policy or impossibility to support the requested values of the individual QoS parameters. If this happens, the PCF may provide in the response to the AF one or more combinations of individual QoS parameters that can be supported. The PCF may indicate in the response to the AF that the request is not authorized because the applicable QoS parameters are not supported in the PLMN where the UE is registered, then the AF may retry the request when the UE moves to a different PLMN.\nIn addition to the QoS Reference or the individual QoS parameters described above, the AF may provide further parameters associated with the Flow Description, e.g. parameters that describe traffic characteristics as described in clause 6.1.3.23 or 6.1.3.23a and Indication of ECN marking for L4S.\nThe PCF generates a PCC Rule with service data flow filter (including IP Packet Filter set as in clause 5.7.6.2 of TS 23.501 [2]) or Ethernet Packet Filter set as in clause 5.7.6.3 of TS 23.501 [2]) derived from the Flow Descriptions provided by the AF, the derived PCC rule QoS parameters such a 5QI, ARP, GBR and MBR (see clause 6.3.1 for all possible PCC rule QoS parameters) and the associated TSC Assistance Container as received from the TSN AF or TSCTSF.\nFor TSC QoS, the PCF derives the 5QI value as defined in clause 5.27.3 of TS 23.501 [2], the PCF derives the MBR using the Requested Maximum Bitrate provided by the AF and sets the GBR equal to the MBR unless the AF provides a Requested Guaranteed Bitrate, in which case the MBR and GBR are set separately.\nIf the PCF gets informed about Policy Control Request Triggers relevant for the AF session, the PCF shall inform the AF about it as defined in clause 6.1.3.18.\nIf an AF session can adjust to different QoS parameter combinations, the AF may provide Alternative Service Requirements in a prioritized order (indicating the preference of the QoS requirements with which the service can operate) in addition to the QoS Reference or individual QoS parameters. Alternative Service Requirements contain:\n-\tWhen the AF requests the network to provide QoS with a QoS Reference, one or more QoS Reference parameters in a prioritized order.\n-\tWhen the AF requests the network to provide QoS with individual QoS parameters, one or more Requested Alternative QoS Parameter Set(s) in a prioritized order. Each Requested Alternative QoS Parameter Set is comprised of the following individual parameters: Requested 5GS Delay, Requested Guaranteed Flow Bitrate Requested Packet Error Rate and optionally, a Requested Averaging Window. Each requested Alternative QoS Parameter Set may also include a Maximum Burst Size parameter.\nIf the AF request is sent via the TSCTSF, the TSCTSF determines a Requested PDB considering the Requested 5GS Delay and the UE-DS-TT Residence Time.\nAn AF that provides Alternative Service Requirements shall also subscribe to receive notifications from the PCF for successful resource allocation and when the QoS targets can no longer (or can again) be fulfilled as described in clause 6.1.3.18.\nWhen the PCF authorizes the service information from the AF and generates a PCC rule, it shall also derive Alternative QoS Parameter Sets for this PCC rule based on the QoS Reference parameters or the Requested Alternative QoS Parameter Sets in the Alternative Service Requirements. If the AF provided Requested Alternative QoS Parameter Sets in the request, the PCF may reject any of the Requested Alternative QoS Parameter Sets it has received based on operator policy or impossibility to support the requested values of the individual parameters. If this happens, the PCF may provide in the response to the AF one or more Requested Alternative QoS Parameters Sets that can be supported.\nThe PCF shall enable QoS Notification Control and include the derived Alternative QoS parameter sets (in the same prioritized order indicated by the AF) in the PCC rule sent to the SMF. When the PCF notifies the AF that QoS targets can no longer be fulfilled, the PCF shall include the QoS Reference parameter or the set of Requested Alternative QoS Parameters corresponding to the Alternative QoS parameter set referenced by the SMF, or an indication that the lowest priority QoS Reference or the lowest priority set of Requested Alternative QoS Parameters of the Alternative Service Requirements cannot be fulfilled (as described in clause 6.1.3.18).\nNOTE 3:\tThe AF behaviour is out of the scope of this TS but can include adaptation to the change of QoS (e.g. rate adaptation) as well as application layer signalling with the UE.\nThe AF may change the Alternative Service Requirements while the AF session is ongoing. If this happens, the PCF shall update the Alternative QoS parameter sets in the PCC rule accordingly.\nThe AF may indicate to the PCF that the UE does not need to be informed about changes related to Alternative QoS Profiles. With this indication received from the AF, the PCF decides whether to disable the notifications to the UE when changes related to the Alternative QoS Profiles occur and sets the Disable UE notifications at changes related to Alternative QoS Profiles parameter in the PCC rule accordingly.\nThe AF may also provide the PCF with QoS duration and QoS inactivity interval. The requested QoS is applied to each QoS duration interval. Once the PCF receives the request from the AF, the PCF provides a PCC Rule with the QoS parameters to SMF to allocate resources. The PCF may allocate resources at the beginning of each QoS duration interval and release the resources at the end of the corresponding QoS duration interval. This process is repeated until the AF session is revoked. If the AF has subscribed to the PCF and resource allocation for any of the QoS duration interval fails, the PCF informs the AF of the resource allocation failure.\nNOTE 4:\tWhen leveraging the QoS duration and the QoS inactivity interval, both are expected to be in the order of minutes to avoid too frequent signalling between RAN, AF and 5GC/PCF.\nIf the AF provides an explicit indication (i.e. Indication of ECN marking for L4S support) that the UL and/or DL of the service data flow supports ECN marking for L4S or the PCF decides, based on local configuration, that the service data flow supports ECN marking for L4S, then the PCF may explicitly, or implicitly (based on PCF/SMF local configuration), indicate to the SMF to enable for ECN marking for L4S. The PCF decision may be taken, based on local configuration in PCF and SMF and L4S traffic detection result. If L4S support is detected on the UL and/or DL traffic of the service data flow, the QoS Flow is enabled with ECN marking for L4S, see clause 5.37.3 of TS 23.501 [2].\nThe PCF may generate policies to request to monitor the Traffic Parameter (i.e. N6 jitter range associated with DL Periodicity) and include it into a PCC rule based local policy. Based on the received PCC rule or local configuration, the SMF indicates UPF to monitor and report the requested traffic characteristics as described in clause 5.37.8.2 of TS 23.501 [2].",

If so, the TSCTSF provides the Flow Descriptions, the TSC Assistance Container (as described in clause 5.27.2.3 of TS 23.501 [2]), and the related QoS information to the PCF by setting up an AF session with required QoS as described in clause 6.1.3.22. In addition, the TSCTSF may provide the following parameters to the PCF:\n-\tPort Management Information Container and related Port number as applicable.\n-\tUser plane node Management Information Container.\n-\toptionally, Notification Target Address for PMIC/UMIC UPF event and Correlation ID for PMIC/UMIC UPF event.\nThe TSCTSF may use the PTP Port state of NW-TT and DS-TT in the Port/User plane node Management Information Container to determine the Port Pairs that will be used for (g)PTP delivery. Based on this the TSCTSF may request appropriate QoS treatment for the (g)PTP flows from PCF.\nThe AF may include the Capability for BAT adaptation or a BAT Window or Periodicity Range in the request (as described in clause 5.27.2.3 of TS 23.501 [2]), if so the TSCTSF subscribes to Notification on BAT offset defined in clause 6.1.3.18. The PCF sends the BAT offset received from the SMF to the AF and the AF adjusts the burst sending time according to the indicated BAT offset. If the PCF additionally sends the adjusted periodicity received from the SMF to the AF, the AF adjusts the periodicity in addition to the burst sending time according to the indicated adjusted periodicity.\nThe AF may subscribe to requested 5G access stratum time synchronization service or (g)PTP time synchronization service status update notifications for target UE(s) from TSCTSF. The TSCTSF may determine whether the clock quality acceptance criteria requested by AF can be met or not, and performs behaviours per acceptance criteria result as described in clause 5.27.1.12 of TS 23.501 [2].\nNOTE:\tFor the adjustment of burst sending time and periodicity in UL direction it is expected that the AF interacts with the application in the UE or devices behind the UE based on application layer signalling.\n6.1.3.23b\tSupport of IETF Deterministic Networking\nEnablers for the support of IETF Deterministic Networking are defined in clauses 4.4.8.4 and 5.28.5 of TS 23.501 [2].\nWhen the PCF has received the 5GS Bridge/Router information for the PDU Session from SMF and has a subscription for the 5GS Bridge/Router information Notification from the TSCTSF or based on a local policy, if integration with IETF Deterministic Networking applies, the PCF provides the following information to the TSCTSF for device side ports:\n-\tuser-plane node ID;\n-\tport number;\n-\tIP address or IPv6 prefix allocated to the PDU Session;\n-\tMTU size for IPv4 or MTU size for IPv6 (optional).\nUpon reception of the above information, if the TSCTSF does not have a corresponding AF session, the TSCTSF shall create an AF session with the PCF.\nThe TSCTSF shall subscribe for notifications from the PCF for reporting of extra UE addresses for the same PDU Session. As a result, the TSCTSF shall be notified of any extra address or address range that is allocated for the given PDU Session as a result of Framed Routes or IPv6 Prefix delegation.\nWhen the TSCTSF is first notified about a 5GS DetNet router identified by the user-plane node ID, the TSCTSF may subscribe with the NW-TT for receiving user plane node management information changes for the 5GS router, as described in clause 5.28.3.1 of TS 23.501 [2].\nAfter receiving a User plane node Management Information Container (UMIC) containing the NW-TT port numbers, the TSCTSF may subscribe with the NW-TT for receiving NW-TT port management information changes for the NW-TT port indicated by each of the NW-TT port numbers as described in clause 5.28.3.1 of TS 23.501 [2]. For network side ports, the Port Management Information Container may contain information to be exposed to the DetNet controller (see Information for deterministic networking in Table K.1-1 of TS 23.501 [2]).\nThe TSCTSF may receive DetNet YANG configuration as described in IETF RFC 9633 [37] from a DetNet Controller that describe the traffic characteristics and requirements.\nWhen both the TSCTSF and the DetNet controller support 3GPP extensions to the IETF RFC 9633 [37], the DetNet controller may provide the 5GS-node-max-latency and 5GS-node-max-loss specific to the 5GS system.\nNOTE 1:\tThe 3GPP extension to the IETF RFC 9633 [37] is defined in 3GPP as a YANG model which imports IETF RFC 9633 [37] and adds the 3GPP specific parameters. The 3GPP defined YANG model uses the 3GPP namespace as defined in RFC 5279 [38].\nNOTE 2:\tIf the DetNet YANG configuration neither includes 5GS specific 5GS-node-max-latency nor the end-to-end Max-latency, the TSCTSF can derive the Requested 5GS Delay or the PCF can derive the PDB. Similarly, if the DetNet YANG configuration neither includes 5GS specific 5GS-node-max-loss nor the end-to-end Max-loss, the TSCTSF can derive the Requested Packet Error Rate or the PCF can derive the PER. This derivation is not further specified.\nThe TSCTSF provides the Flow Descriptions, the TSC Assistance Container (as described in clause 5.27.2.3 of TS 23.501 [2]), and the related QoS information to the PCF as specified in the AF session with required QoS procedure for the signalling between the TSCTSF and the PCF described in clause 4.15.6.6 of TS 23.502 [3]. The TSCTSF can set up an AF session on behalf of DetNet controller with required QoS as described in clause 6.1.3.22. The TSCTSF maps the DetNet configuration as follows before interacting with the PCF.\n-\t5GS-node-max-latency to Requested 5GS Delay.\n-\tMin-bandwidth to Requested Guaranteed Bitrate.\n-\t5GS-node-max-loss to Requested Packet Error Rate.\n-\tMax-consecutive-loss-tolerance to Survival time (see clause 5.27.2.1 of TS 23.501 [2]) - when such mapping is possible, such as when there is only a single packet per interval.\n-\tInterval to Periodicity.\n-\tmax-pkts-per-interval * (max-payload-size + protocol header size) to Maximum Burst Size.\n-\tmax-pkts-per-interval * (max-payload-size + protocol header size)/ Interval to Requested Maximum Bitrate.\n-\tDetNet flow specification is mapped to the Flow Description information. The DetNet flow specification is based on the following header fields: IP source and destination address, IPv4 protocol or IPv6 next header, IPv4 type of service or IPv6 traffic class, IPv6 flow label, TCP or UDP source or destination ports, IPsec SPI as defined in clause 5.1 of IETF RFC 8939 [42], which are mapped to the corresponding fields in the Flow Description information.\nIf the DetNet YANG configuration includes the Max-latency and Max-loss only for the end-to-end flow and not the 5GS specific requirement, the TSCTSF determines the requirements applicable to 5GS (5GS-node-max-latency and 5GS-node-max-loss) based on a pre-configured mapping for the given deployment.\nBased on the mapping, the TSCTSF provides the Flow Descriptions, the TSC Assistance Container (as described in clause 5.27.2.3 of TS 23.501 [2]), and the related QoS information to the PCF by setting up an AF session with required QoS as described in clause 6.1.3.22.\nThe TSCTSF shall subscribe to the Resource allocation outcome and Service Data Flow deactivation events at the PCF, so that TSCTSF gets notified when the DetNet requirements are not satisfied. In that case, the DetNet controller shall be notified.",

The request from the AF may also include parameters for QoS monitoring and parameters that describe the traffic characteristics.\nAccording to the QoS parameters for AF session with QoS as described in clause 6.1.3.22, the parameters that describe the traffic characteristics for AF session with QoS as described in clause 6.1.3.23a, and the parameters to subscribe to be notified of the QoS Monitoring reports as described in clause 6.1.3.21, the AF request information may include:\n-\tDNN and S-NSSAI;\n-\tInformation about target UEs: External Group Identifier or GPSI;\n-\tFlow Descriptions as described in clause 6.1.3.6;\nNOTE 1:\tAt the time of providing Flow Description from AF, the AF can only provide the server side information as Flow Description, e.g. 3-tuple(s) including protocol, server side IP address and port number. At the time of applying the Flow Description for generation of PCC rules, the PCF can supplement the UE side information, e.g. UE IP address and port.\n-\tTraffic characteristics as described in clause 6.1.3.23 or clause 6.1.3.23a;\n-\tQoS parameters (e.g. QoS Reference or individual QoS parameters or Alternative QoS Parameter Set) as defined in clause 6.1.3.22;\n-\tQoS parameters for monitoring as defined in clause 6.1.3.21;\nNOTE 2:\tThe AF can support monitoring of specific performance characteristic by requesting the Notification control with Alternative QoS Profiles as defined in clause 5.7.2.4.1b of TS 23.501 [2] and deriving the specific degraded QoS characteristic (e.g. GFBR, PDB or PER) and the way it is degraded with the \"GFBR can no longer be guaranteed\" notifications and indications to Alternative QoS Profile.\n-\tTemporal invalidity condition (start-time, end-time), indicate the time period when there will be no user payload for the DNN/S-NSSAI and Flow Descriptions provided with the request (e.g. at night or on weekends);\n-\tSubscription to events as defined in clause 6.1.3.18.\nThe NEF determines whether or not to invoke the TSCTSF in the same way as for AF session with required QoS procedure, as described in step 2 of clause 4.15.6.6 in TS 23.502 [3].\nIn case the TSCTSF is not used, the NEF stores the AF request on UDR.

The PCF may retrieve PDU Session policy control subscription information using both the replaced S-NSSAI and the Alternative S-NSSAI. The PCF makes policy decision by combining subscription information of the replaced NSSAI and the Alternative S-NSSAI based on the principle that if there is common information present for both S-NSSAIs, the PCF choses the data of the replaced S-NSSAI. The PCF maintains both the S-NSSAI and the Alternative S-NSSAI in the Session Management context. The PCF registers the replaced S-NSSAI in the BSF.\nWhen the existing PDU Session is transferred from S-NSSAI to Alternative S-NSSAI, if the SMF determines that the existing PDU Session and existing SM Policy Association can be retained (e.g. if the SMF determines that same PCF can be used for the Alternative S-NSSAI) and the PCF set the Network Slice Replacement PCRT to request the SMF to report as defined in clause 6.1.3.5, then the SMF includes the Alternative S-NSSAI in SM Policy Association modification request to PCF to update the S-NSSAI of the PDU Session. The PCF may request subscription information associated with the Alternative S-NSSAI from the UDR. Then the PCF makes policy decision by combining subscription information of the replaced NSSAI and the Alternative S-NSSAI based on the principle that if there is common information present for both S-NSSAIs, the PCF choses the data of the replaced S-NSSAI and may provide updated PCC rules to SMF. The PCF does not update the binding information in the BSF.

The PCF requests subscription information associated with the replaced S-NSSAI from the UDR, if not already available. Then the PCF makes policy decision based on the replaced S-NSSAI and may provide updated PCC rules to SMF. The PCF does not update the binding information in the BSF. If the SMF determines that the existing PDU Session and existing SM Policy Association is not retained (e.g. if the SMF determines that PCF discovery and selection for the Alternative S-NSSAI is to be performed), then the SMF terminates the existing SM Policy Association, and the PCF removes the SUPI to S-NSSAI association from the BSF. Then the SMF establishes a new SM Policy Association.\nWhen existing PDU Session is transferred back to the replaced S-NSSAI, the SMF sends SM Policy Association modification request to PCF to update the S-NSSAI of the PDU Session. Then the PCF makes policy decision based on the replaced S-NSSAI and may provide updated PCC rules to the SMF.\nWhen the PCF receives the SM Policy Association establishment (or modification) request message including the S-NSSAI and the Alternative S-NSSAI, the PCF checks if the PDU Session of a SUPI for a DNN and a S-NSSAI that has been replaced by an Alternative S-NSSAI is subject of usage monitoring control and PCF determines based on operator policy to perform usage monitoring related information per DNN and Alternative S-NSSAI combination instead of per DNN and replaced S-NSSAI combination, if so, the PCF terminates the usage monitoring for the replaced S-NSSAI, both on PDU Session and per PCC Rule level and updates the remaining allowed usage for the replaced S-NSSAI, as it is not currently in use, as described in clause 6.2.1.7. The PCF initiates usage monitoring for the Alternative S-NSSAI, as such retrieves usage monitoring related information per DNN and Alternative S-NSSAI combination for a SUPI from the UDR if available, then performs usage monitoring control as described in clause 6.2.1.7. When the Alternative S-NSSAI is not longer in use, the PCF terminates the usage monitoring control for the Alternative S-NSSAI, both on PDU Session level and per PCC Rule, and updating the remaining allowed usage for the Alternative S-NSSAI, as it is not currently in use, as described in clause 6.2.1.7. The usage monitoring control may continue for the replaced S-NSSAI as per current procedures in clause 6.2.1.7.\nThe PCRTs provided to the SMF are still reported to the PCF, when the PDU Session is established or has been replaced by an Alternative S-NSSAI.",

      "content": "The PCF supports usage monitoring control for a PDU Session or per Monitoring Key. Usage is defined as either volume or time of user plane traffic.\nThe PCF may receive usage monitoring related information per DNN and S-NSSAI combination and UE from the UDR, i.e. the overall amount of allowed resources (based either on traffic volume and/or traffic time) that are to be monitored for the PDU Sessions of a user, together with the corresponding remaining allowed usage related information. In addition, usage monitoring related information for Monitoring key(s) per DNN and S-NSSAI combination and UE may also be received from the UDR, together with the corresponding remaining allowed usage related information. For the purpose of usage monitoring per access type, the PCF receives an individual Monitoring key per access type from UDR. Details about the usage monitoring related information and the remaining allowed usage related information provided by the UDR are described in clause 6.2.1.3.\nFor the purpose of usage monitoring control the PCF shall request the Usage report trigger and provide the necessary usage threshold(s), either volume threshold, time threshold, or both volume threshold and time threshold, upon which the SMF shall report to the PCF. The PCF shall decide if and when to activate usage monitoring to the SMF.\nThe PCF may provide a Monitoring time to the SMF for the Monitoring keys(s) and optionally specify a subsequent threshold value for the usage after the Monitoring time.\nIf the SMF reports usage before the Monitoring time is reached, the Monitoring time is not retained by the SMF. Therefore, the PCF may again provide a Monitoring time and optionally the subsequent threshold value for the usage after the Monitoring time in the response.\nIt shall be possible for the PCF to request a usage report from the SMF.\nNOTE 1:\tThe PCF ensures that the number of requests/following policy decisions provided to the SMF do not cause excessive signalling load by e.g. assigning the same time for the report only for a preconfigured number of PDU Sessions.\nOnce the PCF receives a usage report from the SMF the PCF shall deduct the value of the usage report from the remaining allowed usage for that DNN and S-NSSAI combination and UE (if usage per PDU Session is reported). If usage is reported from the SMF, the PCF shall deduct the value of the usage report from the remaining allowed usage for individual Monitoring key(s) for that DNN and S-NSSAI combination and UE (if usage for one or several Monitoring keys is reported).\nNOTE 2:\tThe PCF maintains usage thresholds for each Monitoring key and PDU Session that is active for a certain DNN and S-NSSAI combination and UE. Updating the remaining allowed usage after the SMF reporting, minimizes the risk of exceeding the usage allowance.\nIf the remaining allowed usage reaches a value of zero (or below zero), the PCF may apply other policy decisions and interact with the SMF accordingly.\nIf the SMF reports usage for a certain Monitoring key and if monitoring shall continue for that Monitoring key then the PCF shall provide new threshold value(s) in the response to the SMF respectively. If Monitoring time and subsequent threshold value are used then the PCF provides them to the SMF as well.\nThe PCF may provide a new volume threshold and/or a new time threshold to the SMF, the new threshold values overrides the existing threshold values in the SMF.\nIf monitoring shall no longer continue for that Monitoring key, then the PCF shall not provide a new threshold in the response to the SMF.\nIf the last PDU Session of a user for a DNN and S-NSSAI combination is terminated, the PCF shall store the remaining allowed usage, i.e. the information about the remaining overall amount of resources, in the UDR.\nIf the End date of the usage monitoring related information (see clause 6.2.1.3 for details) is reached, the PCF shall reset the remaining allowed usage to the value(s) indicated in the usage monitoring related information and shall then interact with the SMF to undo any previously applied policy decisions related to remaining allowed usage of zero (or below zero).",

For sponsored data connectivity, the PCF may receive a usage threshold from the AF. If the AF specifies a usage threshold, the PCF shall use the Sponsor Identity to construct a Monitoring key for monitoring the volume, time, or both volume and time of user plane traffic, and invoke usage monitoring on the SMF. The PCF shall notify the AF when the SMF reports that a usage threshold for the Monitoring key is reached provided that the AF requests to be notified for this event, as described in clause 6.1.3.18. If the usage threshold is reached, the AF may terminate the AF session or provide a new usage threshold to the PCF. Alternatively, the AF may allow the session to continue without specifying a usage threshold. If the AF decides to allow the session to continue without specifying a usage threshold, then monitoring in the SMF shall be discontinued for that monitoring key by the PCF, unless there are other reasons for continuing the monitoring.\nIf the H-PCF detects that the UE is in a home-routed roaming scenario when sponsored data connectivity is requested by an AF, it may allow the sponsored data connectivity in the service authorization request, reject the service authorization request, or initiate the AF session termination based on home operator policy.\nNOTE:\tSponsored data connectivity is not supported in the roaming with local breakout scenario in this Release.\nIf the AF revokes the service information and the AF has notified previously a usage threshold to the PCF, the PCF shall report the usage up to the time of the revocation of service authorization.\nIf the PDU Session terminates and the AF has specified a usage threshold then the PCF shall notify the AF of the accumulated usage (i.e. either volume, or time, or both volume and time) of user plane traffic since the last usage report.",

To enable this monitoring, the SMF selects the same PCF instance for all PDU Sessions of the UE to the S-NSSAI that is subject to this monitoring, this is achieved as described in clause 6.3.7.1 of TS 23.501 [2], for example by using local operator policies in the SMF, SUPI ranges or explicit indication from the AMF to select the PCF selected for the UE.\nIf the monitored data rate per S-NSSAI for a UE reaches a certain percentage of the Subscribed UE-Slice-MBR value for that S-NSSAI (detected via operator defined thresholds), the PCF may apply a policy decision to strengthen the traffic restrictions for individual PDU Sessions or PCC rules (e.g. to change Session-AMBR value (if allowed by the HPLMN) or update PCC Rule(s) to change QoS or charging keys(s)) and interact with the SMF accordingly. When the data rate per S-NSSAI for a UE falls below that percentage of the Subscribed UE-Slice-MBR value, the PCF may relax the traffic restrictions for individual PDU Sessions or PCC rules.\nNOTE 1:\tIt is recommended to avoid frequent policy decisions which trigger a signalling with the UE (like change of Session-AMBR or change of MBR in a PCC rule belonging to a GBR service data flow).\nNOTE 2:\tAt the same time the UE-Slice-MBR may be enforced in the NG-RAN, as described in clause 5.15.13 of TS 23.501 [2].",

      "content": "The SMF is responsible for the enforcement of the policy decisions related to service data flow detection, authorized QoS, charging, gating, traffic usage reporting, packet routing and forwarding and traffic steering. The SMF controls the policy and charging enforcement which includes the binding of service data flows to QoS Flows (as described in clause 6.1.3.2.4) as well as the interaction with the CHF. The SMF interacts with the UPF(s), the RAN and the UE to achieve the appropriate treatment of the user plane traffic.\nThe SMF control of the UPF(s) is described in TS 23.501 [2] as well as the interaction principles between SMF and RAN and between SMF and UE. The procedures for the interaction between SMF and UPF, SMF and RAN as well as SMF and UE are described in TS 23.502 [3].\nThe SMF is enforcing the Policy Control as indicated by the PCF in two different ways:\n-\tGate enforcement. The SMF shall instruct the UPF to allow a service data flow, which is subject to policy control, to pass through the UPF if and only if the corresponding gate is open;\n-\tQoS enforcement:\n-\t5QI corresponding with 5G QoS Characteristics. The SMF shall be able to convert a 5QI value to 5G QoS Characteristics values.\n-\tPCC rule QoS enforcement. The SMF shall instruct the UPF to enforce the authorized QoS of a service data flow according to the active PCC rule (e.g. to enforce DSCP marking).\n-\tQoS Flow QoS enforcement. The SMF controls the QoS that is provided to a combined set of service data flows. The policy enforcement function ensures that the resources which can be used by an authorized set of service data flows are within the \"authorized resources\" specified by the PCF. The authorized QoS provides an upper bound on the resources that can be reserved (GFBR) or allocated (MFBR) for the QoS Flow. During QoS Flow QoS enforcement, if packet filters are provided to the UE, the SMF shall provide packet filters with the same content as that in the SDF template filters received from the PCF.\nThe SMF is enforcing the charging control in the following way:\n-\tFor a service data flow (defined by an active PCC rule) that is subject to charging control, the SMF shall allow the service data flow to pass through the UPF if and only if there is a corresponding active PCC rule with and, for online charging, the CHF has authorized credit for the charging key. The SMF may let a service data flow pass through the UPF during the course of the credit re-authorization procedure.\nFor a service data flow (defined by an active PCC rule) that is subject to both Policy Control and Charging Control, the SMF shall allow the service data flow to pass through the UPF if and only if the right conditions from both policy control and charging control happen. i.e. the corresponding gate is open and in the case of online charging the CHF has authorized credit for its charging key.\nFor a service data flow (defined by an active PCC rule) that is subject to policy control only and not charging control, the SMF shall allow the service data flow to pass through the UPF if and only if the conditions for policy control are met.\nA SMF may be served by one or more PCF nodes. The SMF shall contact the appropriate PCF as described in clause 6.3.7.1 of TS 23.501 [2].\nThe operator may configure an indicator in UDM which is delivered to the SMF within the Charging Characteristics and used by the SMF to not establish the SM Policy Association during the PDU Session establishment procedure.\nNOTE 1:\tThe decision to not establish the SM Policy Association applies for the life time of the PDU Session.\nNOTE 2:\tThe indicator in the UDM is operator specific, therefore its value is understood within the HPLMN and can be used in both non-roaming or home routed roaming cases.\nThe SMF shall, on request from the PCF, modify a PCC rule, using the equivalent SMF behaviour as the removal of the old and the activation of the new (modified) PCC rule. The SMF shall modify a PCC rule as an atomic operation. The SMF shall not modify a predefined PCC rule on request from the PCF.\nThe SMF should support predefined PCC rules.\nThe SMF shall gather and report QoS Flow usage information according to clause 6.1.3.3. The SMF may have a pre-configured Default charging method. Upon the initial interaction with the PCF, the SMF shall provide pre-configured Default charging method if available.\nAt PDU Session establishment the SMF shall initiate the SM Policy Association Establishment procedure. If no PCC rule was activated for the PDU Session, the SMF shall reject the PDU Session establishment.\nIf there is no PCC rule active for a successfully established PDU Session at any later point in time, e.g. through a PCF initiated SM Policy Association Modification, the SMF shall initiate a PDU Session termination procedure. If the PCF terminates the SM Policy Association, the SMF shall initiate a PDU Session termination procedure.\nIf there is no PCC rule active for a successfully established QoS Flow at any later point in time, e.g. through a PCF triggered SM Policy Association Modification, the SMF shall initiate a PDU Session Modification procedure an terminate the QoS Flow.\nIf the PDU Session is modified, e.g. by changing the characteristics for an QoS Flow, the SMF shall first use the Policy Control Request Trigger to determine whether to request the PCC rules for the modified PDU Session from the PCF; afterwards, the SMF shall use the re-authorisation triggers, if available, in order to determine whether to require re-authorisation for the PCC rules that were either unaffected or modified. If the SMF receives an unsolicited update of the PCC rules from the PCF, the PCC rules shall be activated, modified or removed as indicated by the PCF.\nThe SMF shall inform the PCF about the outcome of a PCC rule operation. If a QoS Flow cannot be established or modified to satisfy the QoS Flow binding, then the SMF shall reject the activation of a PCC rule. If the SMF is requested to notify the PCF about a successful resource allocation (see clause 6.1.3.5) and the currently fulfilled QoS of an established or modified QoS Flow matches an Alternative QoS Profile (as described in clause 5.7.2.4.3 of TS 23.501 [2]), the SMF shall also provide to the PCF the reference to the Alternative QoS parameter set corresponding to the Alternative QoS Profile referenced by the RAN.\nThe SMF shall inform the PCF about any removal of a PCC rule, that the PCF has activated, that occurs without explicit instruction from the PCF.\nWhen QoS Flow resources are released, i.e. at SM Policy Association termination or SMF-initiated SM Policy Association modification notifying that PCC Rules are removed, the SMF shall also provide, if available, the reason why resources are released, i.e. RAN/NAS Release Cause.\nNOTE 3:\tIn the case of a rejection of a PCC rule activation the PCF may e.g. modify the attempted PCC rule, de-activate or modify other PCC rules and retry activation or abort the activation attempt and, if applicable, inform the AF that transmission resources are not available.\nThe SMF forwards the Maximum Packet Loss Rate for UL and DL, if received from PCF for the PCC rule bound to a 5QI=1 QoS Flow. In the case multiple PCC Rules share one 5QI=1 QoS Flow and the SMF received multiple Maximum Packet Loss Rates, the SMF chooses the lowest value per direction related to these PCC rules.\nWhen the PCF provides updated PCC rules for the PDU Session to the SMF, and the PCC rules were not enforced due to that the UE is in suspend state, e.g. due to SRVCC to GERAN without DTM support as specified in clause 6.2.2.1 in the TS 23.216 [25] or CSFB to UTRAN without PS Handover as specified in clause 6.5 in the TS 23.272 [26], the SMF shall indicate to the PCF that the PCC Rules were not enforced with the reason that the UE is in suspend state. Upon reception of the failure indication, the PCF may subscribe to UE resumed from suspend state event trigger.\nNOTE 4:\tThis above description applies in the case of EPC interworking.\nWhen the PCF provides updated PCC rules for the PDU Session to the SMF, and the PCC rules were not enforced due to that the UE is not reachable, e.g. the UE using extended idle mode DRX as specified in clause 4.2.3 of TS 23.502 [3], the SMF shall indicate to the PCF that the resource allocation failure with the reason that the UE is unreachable and may provide a maximum waiting time, that is based on the Estimated Maximum Wait time provided by the AMF to the SMF. Upon reception of the failure indication, the PCF waits for the maximum waiting time to expire and may subscribe to change of UE reachability status to the SMF, as defined in clause 6.1.3.5.",

If new threshold is provided only for time or volume, then the measurements shall continue only for that provided type and the SMF shall ensure that the accumulated usage for the non provided type is discarded by the UPF.\nWhen the PCF requests to report usage, the SMF shall report the accumulated usage to the PCF according to the provided usage threshold, i.e. the SMF reports accumulated volume when the volume threshold was provided by the PCF, accumulated time when the time threshold was provided by the PCF and both accumulated volume and accumulated time when volume threshold and time threshold were provided by the PCF.\nIf the Usage thresholds for a Monitoring key are not provided to the SMF in the acknowledgement of a PDU Session modification where its usage was reported, then the usage monitoring shall not continue in the SMF for that Monitoring key.\nWhen the Monitoring time occurs, the accumulated volume and/or time usage shall be recorded by the UPF and reported to the SMF, and:\n-\tIf the subsequent usage threshold value is provided, the usage threshold shall be reset to this value by the SMF.\n-\tOtherwise, the usage threshold shall be set by the SMF to the remaining value of the threshold previously sent by the PCF (i.e. excluding the accumulated usage).\nThe first usage report after the Monitoring Time was reached shall indicate the usage up to the Monitoring time and usage after the Monitoring time.\nIn order to support time based usage monitoring, the PCF may optionally indicate to the SMF, along with other usage monitoring information provided, the Inactivity Detection Time. This value represents the time interval after which the time measurement shall stop for the Monitoring key, if no packets are received belonging to the corresponding Monitoring Key during that time period. Time measurement shall resume on receipt of a further packet belonging to the Monitoring key.\nTime measurement for a Monitoring key shall also be stopped when time based usage monitoring is disabled, if this happens before the Inactivity Detection Time is reached.\nIf an Inactivity Detection Time value of zero is provided, or if no Inactivity Detection Time is present within the usage monitoring information provided by the PCF, the time measurement shall be performed continuously from the point at which it was started until time based usage monitoring is disabled.\nThe SMF instructs the UPF to provide usage reports to the SMF as described in TS 23.501, clause 5.8.2.6.",

      "content": "The Application Function (AF) is an element offering applications that require dynamic policy and/or charging control over the user plane behaviour and/or an element requesting non-session based network capability exposure. In this specification, the functionality of the AF is only defined with respect to the interaction with the 5G Core Network.\nAn AF may contact the PCF via the NEF for network capability exposure as defined in clause 4.3.6. Based on operator deployment, an AF considered to be trusted by the operator can be allowed to interact directly with the PCF. AFs not allowed by the operator to directly interact with the PCF shall use the network capability exposure framework (see clause 7.3 of TS 23.501 [2]) to interact with the PCF via the NEF.\nAn AF may communicate with multiple PCFs. The mechanism for an AF to select the PCF associated to a PDU Session based on the UE address is described in clause 6.1.1.2.\nThe AF shall communicate with the PCF to transfer dynamic session information, required for PCF decisions as well as to receive access network specific information and notifications about events related to the PDU Session or the QoS Flow transferring the application traffic. One example of an AF is the P‑CSCF of the IM CN subsystem.\nThe AF may receive an indication that the service information is not accepted by the PCF together with service information that the PCF would accept. In that case, the AF rejects the service establishment towards the UE. If possible, the AF forwards the service information to the UE that the PCF would accept.\nFor certain events related to policy control, the AF shall be able to give instructions to the PCF to act on its own, i.e. based on the service information currently available as described in clause 6.1.3.6.\nNOTE 1:\tThe QoS authorization based on incomplete service information is required for e.g. IMS session setup scenarios with available resources on originating side and a need for resource reservation on terminating side.\nThe AF may request the PCF to report events related to the PDU Session or the QoS Flow transferring the application traffic as defined in clause 6.1.3.18. The AF may use the access network specific information and notifications about events in the AF session signalling or to adjust the event reporting related to the PDU Session or the QoS Flow transferring the application traffic.\nThe AF may contact the PCF to request a time window and related conditions for future BDT. Details of the AF behaviour to support future BDT are defined in clause 6.1.2.4.\nThe AF may contact the PCF via the NEF to request a time window for PDTQ. Details of the AF behaviour to support PDTQ are defined in clause 6.1.2.7.\nTo support sponsored data connectivity the AF may provide the PCF with the sponsored data connectivity information, including optionally a usage threshold, as specified in clause 6.2.1.1. The AF may request the PCF to report events related to sponsored data connectivity.\nNOTE 2:\tAnnex D describes the scenario for sponsored data connectivity.\nThe AF may receive a request to terminate an AF session. The PCF may include an indication that the transmission resources are lost due to PS to CS handover.\nNOTE 3:\tThe AF action upon reception of the indication that the transmission resources are lost due to PS to CS handover is application specific. The IMS uses the indication to prevent a termination of an ongoing session as specified in TS 24.229 [29] and TS 24.237 [30].\nThe AF may send guidance to PCF for the determination of proper URSP rules for the UE. Details of the application guidance are described in clause 6.6 of TS 23.548 [33] and in clause 4.15.6.10 of TS 23.502 [3].\nFor Time Sensitive Communication and Time synchronization as specified in clause 5.27 of TS 23.501 [2] and in clause 6.1.3.23a, the AF interacts with the TSCTSF (directly or via NEF) and the TSCTSF is interacting with the PCF. Based on operator deployment, an AF considered to be trusted by the operator can be allowed to interact directly with the TSCTSF. AFs not allowed by the operator to directly interact with the TSCTSF shall use the network capability exposure framework (see clause 7.3 of TS 23.501 [2]) to interact with the TSCTSF via the NEF.\nThe AF may request measurements of QoS parameters by subscribing to events (e.g. QoS Monitoring parameters, see clause 6.1.3.18) as part of an AF session with required QoS defined in clause 6.1.3.22.\nThe AF may send the UL and/or DL Periodicity as defined in clause 5.37.8.2 of TS 23.501 [2].\nThe AF may receive a report that resource allocation failure due to UE temporary unreachable together with a maximum waiting time, if available (as described in clause 6.1.3.5). The AF may subscribe to UE reachability status change to receive an indication that the UE is reachable again, the AF stops the maximum waiting timer and may request resource allocation to the PCF.",

If two Traffic steering policy identifiers are provided, then one is for uplink direction, while the other one is for downlink direction.\nNOTE 13:\tOptional and applicable only for voice service data flow in this release.\nNOTE 14:\tOptional and applicable only when a value different from the standardized value for this 5QI in Table 5.7.4-1 TS 23.501 [2] is required.\nNOTE 15:\tOptional and applicable only for GBR service data flow.\nNOTE 16:\tUsage of the charging information in described in TS 32.255 [21].\nNOTE 17:\tOnly one PCC rule can contain this attribute and this PCC rule shall not contain the attribute Bind to QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule.\nNOTE 18:\tNone, one of the two or both may be present in a PCC rule.\nNOTE 19:\tPer DNAI, a Traffic steering policy identifier and/or N6 traffic routing information can be provided. If the pre-configured traffic steering policy (that is referenced by the Traffic steering policy identifier) contains information that is overlapping with the N6 traffic routing information, the N6 traffic routing information shall take precedence.\nNOTE 20:\tOnly applicable to a PCC Rules provided to a MA PDU Session.\nNOTE 21:\tMandatory when MA PDU Session Control information is provided.\nNOTE 22:\tWhen a Charging key for Non-3GPP access is provided, the parameters in the Charging Section (other than the Charging key) apply to both accesses and the Charging key (in the Charging Section) shall be used for charging packets carried via the 3GPP access.\nNOTE 23:\tWhen a Monitoring key for Non-3GPP access is provided, the Monitoring key (in the Usage Monitoring Control Section) shall be used to monitor usage of the packets carried via the 3GPP access.\nNOTE 24:\tOptional and applicable only for GBR service data flow with QoS Notification Control enabled.\nNOTE 25:\tOptional and applicable only for GBR service data flow for which Alternative QoS Parameter Set(s) are provided.\nNOTE 26:\tOne or more Alternative QoS Parameter Sets can be provided in a prioritized order starting with the Alternative QoS Parameter Set that has the highest priority.\nNOTE 27:\tMandatory in MA PDU Session Control information only when there is application identifier in the service data flow template.\nNOTE 28:\tIf this parameter is used, it has to be present in every PCC rule of the PDU Session.\nNOTE 29:\tThe use of traffic correlation is defined in TS 23.501 [2], clauses 5.6.7.1 and 5.29.\nNOTE 30:\tIf Steering Mode is set to \"Redundant\", either a Maximum RTT or a Maximum Packet Loss Rate may be provided, but not both.\nNOTE 31:\tThe Steering functionality \"ATSSS-LL\" shall not be provided together with Steering Mode \"Redundant\".\nNOTE 32:\tThis parameter is only provided when the PCF is configured to provide an explicit indicator to the SMF to enable ECN marking for L4S for the traffic identified by the SDF template.\nNOTE 33:\tThe Transport Mode may be included when the Steering Functionality is the MPQUIC functionality.\nThe Rule identifier shall be unique for a PCC rule within a PDU Session. A dynamically provided PCC rule that has the same Rule identifier value as a predefined PCC rule shall replace the predefined rule within the same PDU Session.\nThe Precedence defines in what order the activated PCC rules within the same PDU Session shall be applied at the UPF for service data flow detection. When a dynamic PCC rule and a predefined PCC rule have the same precedence, the dynamic PCC rule takes precedence.\nNOTE 2:\tThe operator shall ensure that overlap between the predefined PCC rules can be resolved based on precedence of each predefined PCC rule in the SMF. The PCF shall ensure that overlap between the dynamically allocated PCC rules can be resolved based on precedence of each dynamically allocated PCC rule.\nFor downlink packets all the service data flow templates, activated for the PDU Session shall be applied for service data flow detection and for the mapping to the correct QoS Flow. For uplink packets the service data flow templates activated on their QoS Flow shall be applied for service data flow detection (further details are provided in clause 6.2.2.2).\nThe Service data flow template may comprise any number of Service data flow filters or an application identifier as is defined in table 6.3.1.\nNOTE 3:\tPredefined PCC rules may include service data flow templates, which support extended capabilities, including enhanced capabilities to identify events associated with application protocols.\nA Service data flow filter contains information for matching user plane packets for IP PDU traffic or Ethernet PDU traffic. All Service data flow filters of a Service data flow template shall be of the same type, i.e. either Packet Filters for IP or Ethernet PDU traffic (defined in clause 5.7.6 of TS 23.501 [2]). The Service data flow template information within an activated PCC rule is applied by the SMF to instruct the UPF to identify the packets belonging to a particular service data flow.\nFor the IP PDU Session type only, the Service data flow template may consist of an application identifier that references an application detection filter that is used for matching user plane packets. The application identifier is also identifying the application, for which the rule applies. The same application identifier value can occur in a dynamic PCC rule and one or multiple predefined PCC rules. If so, the PCF shall ensure that there is at most one PCC rule active per application identifier value at any time.\nThe Mute for notification defines whether notification to the PCF of application's starts or stops shall be muted. Absence of this parameter means that start/stop notifications shall be sent.\nThe Charging key is the reference to the tariff for the service data flow. Any number of PCC Rules may share the same charging key value. The Charging key values for each service shall be operator configurable.\nNOTE 4:\tAssigning the same Charging key for several service data flows implies that the charging does not require the credit management to be handled separately.\nThe Service identifier identifies the service. PCC Rules may share the same service identifier value. The service identifier provides the most detailed identification, specified for flow-based charging, of a service data flow.\nNOTE 5:\tThe PCC rule service identifier need not have any relationship to service identifiers used on the AF level, i.e. is an operator policy option.\nThe Sponsor Identifier indicates the (3rd) party organization willing to pay for the operator's charge for connectivity required to deliver a service to the end user.\nThe Application Service Provider Identifier indicates the (3rd) party organization delivering a service to the end user.\nThe Charging method indicates whether online charging or offline charging is required, or the service data flow is not subject to any end user charging. If the charging method identifies that the service data flow is not subject to any end user charging, a Charging key shall not be included in the PCC rule for that service data flow, along with other charging related parameters. If the charging method is omitted the SMF shall apply the default charging method provided within the PDU Session related policy information (see clause 6.4). The Charging method is mandatory if there is no default charging method for the PDU Session.\nNOTE 6:\tWith converged charging architecture for 5GC, online charging method also includes usage reporting from the SMF to the CHF. Hence, setting the charging method to online will also result in usage reports and thus allow for offline charging being performed by the CHF.\nThe Service Data Flow handling while requesting credit indicates either \"blocking\" if a credit for the Charging Key needs to be granted as a condition for the PCC Rule to be active or \"non-blocking\" if a credit for the Charging Key has been requested as a condition for the PCC Rule to be active.\nThe Measurement method indicates what measurements apply to charging for a PCC rule.\nThe Service Identifier Level Reporting indicates whether the SMF shall generate reports per Service Identifier. The SMF shall accumulate the measurements from all PCC rules with the same combination of Charging key/Service Identifier values in a single report.\nThe Application Function Record Information identifies an instance of service usage. A subsequently generated usage report (i.e. CDR), generated as a result of the PCC rule by the SMF, may include the Application Function Record Information, if available. The Application Function Record Information may contain the AF Charging Identifier and/or the Flow identifiers. If exclusive charging information related to the Application function record information is required, the PCF shall provide a service identifier, not used by any other PCC rule of the PDU Session at this point in time, for the AF session.\nNOTE 7:\tFor example, the PCF may be configured to maintain a range of service identifier values for each service which require exclusive per instance charging information. Whenever a separate counting or credit management for an AF session is required, the PCF shall select a value, which is not used at this point in time, within that range. The uniqueness of the service identifier in the SMF ensures a separate accounting/credit management while the AF record information identifies the instance of the service.\nThe Gate indicates whether the SMF shall instruct the UPF to let a packet identified by the PCC rule pass through (gate is open) to discard the packet (gate is closed).\nNOTE 8:\tA packet, matching a PCC Rule with an open gate, may be discarded due to credit management reasons.\nThe 5G QoS Identifier, 5QI, represents the QoS parameters for the service data flow. The 5G QoS identifier is scalar and accommodates the need for differentiating QoS in both 3GPP and non-3GPP access type.\nThe bitrates indicate the authorized bitrates at the IP packet level of the SDF, i.e. the bitrates of the IP packets before any access specific compression or encapsulation.\nThe UL maximum-bitrate indicates the authorized maximum bitrate for the uplink component of the service data flow.\nThe DL maximum-bitrate indicates the authorized maximum bitrate for the downlink component of the service data flow.\nThe UL guaranteed-bitrate indicates the authorized guaranteed bitrate for the uplink component of the service data flow.\nThe DL guaranteed-bitrate indicates the authorized guaranteed bitrate for the downlink component of the service data flow.\nThe 'Maximum bitrate' is used for enforcement of the maximum bit rate that the SDF may consume, while the 'Guaranteed bitrate' is used by the SMF to determine resource allocation demands.\nThe UL sharing indication indicates that resource sharing in uplink direction for service data flows with the same value in their PCC rule shall be applied by the SMF as described in clause 6.2.2.4.\nThe DL sharing indication indicates that resource sharing in downlink direction for service data flows with the same value in their PCC rule shall be applied by the SMF as described in clause 6.2.2.4.\nThe Allocation and Retention Priority indicates the allocation, retention and priority of the service data flow. The ARP contains information about the priority level, the pre-emption capability and the pre-emption vulnerability. The Allocation and Retention Priority resolves conflicts of demands for network resources.\nThe Priority Level is signalled together with the 5QI to the (R)AN and UPF, only when a value different from the standardized value in the QoS characteristics Table 5.7.4-1 in TS 23.501 [2] is required.\nThe Averaging Window is signalled together with the 5QI to the (R)AN and UPF, only when a value different from the standardized value in the QoS characteristics Table 5.7.4-1 in TS 23.501 [2] is required.\nThe Maximum Data Burst Volume, MDBV, is signalled together with the 5QI to the (R)AN, only when a value different from the standardized value in the QoS characteristics Table 5.7.4-1 in TS 23.501 [2] is required.\nThe Bind to QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule indicates that the SDF shall be bound to the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule. The presence of this parameter attribute causes the 5QI/ARP of the rule to be ignored by the SMF during the QoS Flow binding.\nThe Bind to QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule and apply PCC rule parameters indicates that the SDF shall be bound to the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule and that the QoS related attributes of the PCC rule shall be applied by the SMF to derive the QoS parameters of the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule instead of the PDU Session related information Authorized default 5QI/ARP.\nNOTE 9:\tThe Bind to QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule and apply PCC rule parameters Indication has to be used whenever the PDU Session related information Authorized default 5QI/ARP (as described in clause 6.3.1) cannot be directly used as the QoS parameters of the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule, for example when a GBR 5QI is used or the 5QI priority level has to be changed.\nThe QoS Notification Control, QNC, indicates whether notifications are requested from the access network (i.e. 3GPP RAN) when the GFBR can no longer (or can again) be guaranteed for a QoS Flow during the lifetime of the QoS Flow. If it is set and the GFBR can no longer (or can again) be guaranteed, the access network (i.e. 3GPP RAN) sends a notification towards the SMF, which then notifies the PCF.\nThe Disable UE notifications at changes related to Alternative QoS Profiles parameter indicates to disable QoS Flow parameters signalling to the UE when the SMF is notified by the NG-RAN of changes in the fulfilled QoS situation. The fulfilled situation is either the QoS profile or an Alternative QoS Profile.\nThe Precedence for TFT packet filter allocation parameter determines the order in which TFT packet filters are allocated for PCC rules. The PCF may include this parameter if there is a possibility to run into a restriction regarding the number of TFT packet filters that can be allocated for the PDU Session and interworking with EPS with N26 deployment is supported (see also clause 4.11.1 of TS 23.502 [3]).\nNOTE 10:\tPCF can know that interworking with EPS with N26 is supported based on DNN and S-NSSAI of the PDU Session.\nThe Reflective QoS Control indicates to apply reflective QoS for the service data flow. The indication is used to control the RQI marking in the DL packets of the service data flow and may trigger the sending of the RQA parameter for the QoS Flow the service data flow is bound to. Reflective QoS is defined in clause 5.7.5 of TS 23.501 [2].\nNOTE 11:\tWhile the UE applies a standardized value for the precedence of all UE derived QoS rules, PCC rules require different precedence values and PCF configuration has to ensure that there is a large enough value range for the precedence of PCC rules corresponding to UE derived QoS rules. To avoid that the precedence of network provided QoS rules need to be changed when Reflective QoS is activated and filters are overlapping, the PCF will take the standardized value for the precedence of UE derived QoS rules into account when setting the precedence value of PCC rules subject to Reflective QoS.\nThe Reflective QoS Control parameter shall not be used for the PCC rule with match-all SDF template. If PCC rule with match-all SDF template is present, the Reflective QoS Control parameter shall not be used for PCC rules which contain the Bind to QoS Flow of the default QoS rule parameter, either.\nThe N6-LAN Traffic Steering Enforcement Control contains Traffic steering policy identifier(s) for steering traffic onto N6-LAN to the appropriate N6 service functions deployed by the operator or a third party, and optional Metadata if received from AF due to Application Function influence on Service Function Chaining as described in clause 5.6.16 of TS 23.501 [2].\nThe ECN marking for L4S indicates that the service data flow supports ECN marking for L4S to be performed.\nThe access network information reporting parameters (User Location Report, UE Timezone Report) instruct the SMF about what information to forward to the PCF when the PCC rule is activated, modified or removed.\nThe Monitoring Key is the reference to a resource threshold. Any number of PCC Rules may share the same monitoring key value. The monitoring key values for each service shall be operator configurable.\nThe Indication of exclusion from session level monitoring indicates that the service data flow shall be excluded from the PDU Session usage monitoring.\nThe Application Function influence on traffic routing Enforcement Control may contain:\n-\ta set of DNAI(s) (i.e. a reference to the DNAI(s) the SMF needs to consider for UPF selection/reselection), an optional Indication of traffic correlation and, per DNAI, a corresponding Traffic steering policy identifier (i.e. a reference to a pre-configured traffic steering policy at the SMF), and/or a corresponding N6 traffic routing information (when the N6 traffic routing information is provided explicitly as part of the AF request, as described in clause 5.6.7 of TS 23.501 [2]), or;\n-\tan AF subscription to UP change events parameter which contains subscription information defined in clause 5.2.8.3 of TS 23.502 [3] for the change of UP path Event Id i.e. an Indication of early and/or late notification and information on where to provide the corresponding notifications (Notification Target Address + Notification Correlation ID as specified in clause 4.15.1 of TS 23.502 [3]) and optionally an indication of \"AF acknowledgment to be expected\" to the corresponding notifications as described in clause 5.6.7 of TS 23.501 [2].\n-\ta user plane latency requirements parameter which contains AF requested information on the requirements for user plane latency defined in TS 23.548 [33].\n-\tan indication for Simultaneous Connectivity at Edge Relocation, which includes Keep existing PSA indication to provide guidance to the network on whether to provide simultaneous connectivity over source and target PSA at edge relocation; also, optionally a related Keep existing PSA timer that indicates the minimum time interval to be considered for inactivity for the traffic described before the connectivity over the source PSA may be removed, as defined in TS 23.548 [33].\n-\tan EAS Correlation indication, which indicates selecting a common EAS for a set of UEs identified by Traffic Correlation ID and accessing the application identified by Service data flow template or FQDN(s).\n-\ta Traffic Correlation ID, identifying a set of UEs accessing the application identified by the Service data flow template or FQDN(s). See more in clause 5.6.7 of TS 23.501 [2].\n-\ta Common EAS IP address, IP address of the common EAS accessed by the UEs with the same Traffic Correlation ID, for the application identified by the Service data flow template.\n-\tFQDN(s), FQDN(s) for the application traffic identified by the Service data flow template, and used for influencing EASDF-based DNS query procedure as defined in TS 23.548 [33].\n-\tNEF Information, Notification Endpoint of the NEF responsible of the set of UEs associated with the Traffic correlation ID.\nThe Traffic Steering Enforcement Control may contain Indication of UE IP address preservation. The SMF takes this indication into account when determining whether to reselect PSA UPF, as specified in clause 5.6.7 of TS 23.501 [2].\nThe Redirect indicates whether the uplink part of the service data flow should be redirected to a controlled address.\nThe Redirect Destination indicates the target redirect address when Redirect is enabled.\nThe UL Maximum Packet Loss Rate indicates the maximum rate for lost packets that can be tolerated in the uplink direction.\nThe DL Maximum Packet Loss Rate indicates the maximum rate for lost packets that can be tolerated in the downlink direction.\nThe Application descriptors provides one or several instances of the OSId and OSAppId combination. It is used by the UE to identify the application traffic for which steering is required based on the Steering Functionality, the Steering Mode, the Steering Mode Indicator and the Threshold Values.\nThe Steering Functionality indicates the method for how traffic matching the SDF template in the UPF or a Traffic descriptor in the UE is sent over the MA PDU Session. The method ATSSS_LL indicates that the traffic matching the SDF template is sent over the MA PDU Session without additional tunnelling, e.g. with IP flow switching. The method MPTCP indicates that the traffic matching the SDF template is sent over the MA PDU Session using MPTCP. The method MPQUIC indicates that traffic matching the SDF template is sent over the MA PDU Session using MPQUIC.\nThe Steering Mode indicates the rule for distributing downlink SDFs in the UPF or uplink traffic in the UE between accesses, together with the associated steering parameters. The PCF may indicate separate values for uplink and downlink directions. The available Steering Modes are defined in TS 23.501 [2].\nThe Steering Mode Indicator indicates that the UE or the UPF or both may change the steering parameters provided in the Steering Mode and may adjust the traffic steering based on their own decisions, as further defined in TS 23.501 [2]. When the PCF selects the Load-Balancing Steering Mode for both the uplink and the downlink, and the PCF provides a Steering Mode Indicator for the uplink equal to UE-assistance operation, then the PCF shall provide the same Steering Mode Indicator for the downlink.\nThe Threshold Values indicate the authorized RTT or Packet Loss Rate for a SDF. Depending on the Steering Mode value, the PCF may include, per SDF, one threshold value for RTT or one threshold value for Packet Loss Rate, or both. The PCF may indicate separate values for uplink and downlink directions. The Steering Modes that may use the threshold values and how the UE and UPF enforces them are defined in TS 23.501 [2].\nThe Transport Mode indicates one of the Transport Modes as defined in TS 23.501 [2] that should be applied for transmitting a UDP flow between UE and UPF. The Transport Mode may be included when the MPQUIC functionality is selected as the Steering Functionality.\nThe Charging key for Non-3GPP access indicates the Charging key that shall be used for charging the detected service data flow traffic carried via Non-3GPP access.

Every set consists of a PER, a PDB, an UL and a DL guaranteed bitrate QoS parameter and optionally, an Averaging Window. For delay-critical service data flow, every Alternative QoS Parameter Set may also include a Maximum Data Burst Volume (MDBV).\nThe content of the TSC Assistance Container is defined in clause 5.27.2 of TS 23.501 [2].\nThe Traffic Parameter Information applies to the UE power saving as specified in clause 5.37.8 of TS 23.501 [2]. The following parameters are included:\n-\tPeriodicity:\n-\tindicates the time period between start of two data bursts in UL and/or DL direction.\n-\tthis parameter is only included when PCF receives the periodicity information from AF.\nThe Traffic Parameter Measurement applies to the UE power saving as specified in clause 5.37.8 of TS 23.501 [2]. The following parameters are included:\n-\tTraffic Parameter to be measured:\n-\tUL and/or DL periodicity. This parameter is only included when PCF does not receive the periodicity information from AF.\n-\tN6 jitter range associated with DL Periodicity.\n-\treporting condition can be optionally included to define the condition for the reporting, such as event triggered or periodic, frequency.\nThe Downlink Data Notification Control applies to the control of subscription to Downlink Data Delivery status event notifications and DDN Failure event notifications as specified in clause 4.15.3 of TS 23.502 [3]. The following parameters are included:\n-\tThe Notification control for DDD status applies as described in clause 4.15.3.2.8 of TS 23.502 [3] and contains the following parameters:\n-\tindication that notifications of Downlink Data Delivery status are required; and\n-\tthe requested type of such notifications (notifications about downlink packets being buffered, and/or discarded).\n-\tThe Notification Control for DDN Failure applies as described in clause 4.15.3.2.9 of TS 23.502 [3] and contains the following parameters:\n-\tindication that notifications of DDN Failure are required.\nNOTE 12:\tDownlink Data Notification Control information is provided to assist the SMF in the generation/update of N4 information. The PCF will not be notified about the Downlink data delivery status events or the DDN Failure events.\nThe PDU Set Control Information is needed to support the delivery of PDU Sets for a service data flow. The parameter values for UL and DL may be different (see clause 5.7.7 of TS 23.501 [2]).\nThe Protocol Description Information needed to support identifying PDU Set Information for DL/UL packets and/or last packet of a DL Data Burst.

      "content": "Policy and Charging Rule operations consist of activation, modification and de-activation of PCC rules. The PCF may activate, modify and deactivate a PCC rule at any time. However, the modification is applicable to dynamic PCC rules only.\nActivation of a dynamic PCC rule provides the PCC rule information to the SMF. Activation of a predefined PCC rule provides an identifier of the relevant PCC rule to the SMF.\nEach PCC rule shall be installed for a single QoS Flow only (for further details about predefined PCC rules see below).\nAn active PCC rule means that:\n-\tthe service data flow template shall be used for service data flow detection;\n-\tthe service data flow template shall be used for mapping of downlink packets to the QoS Flow determined by the QoS Flow binding;\n-\tthe service data flow template shall be used for service data flow detection of uplink packets on the PDU Session determined by the QoS Flow binding;\n-\tusage data for the service data flow shall be recorded;\n-\tpolicies associated with the PCC rule, if any, shall be invoked;\n-\tfor service data flow detection with an application detection filter, the start or the stop of the application traffic is reported to the PCF, if applicable and requested by the PCF. In that case, the notification for start may include service data flow filters, (if possible to provide) and the application instance identifier associated with the service data flow filters.\n-\tEither one of the conditions below:\n-\ta credit has been granted for the service data flow. Applicable when the Charging method is set to \"online\" and the Service Data Flow handling while requesting credit is set to \"blocking\"; or\n-\ta credit has been requested for the service data flow. Applicable when the Charging method is set to \"online\" and the Service Data Flow handling while requesting credit is set to \"non-blocking\".\nA predefined PCC rule is known at least, within the scope of one PDU Session.\nNOTE 1:\tThe same predefined PCC rule can be activated for multiple QoS Flows in multiple PDU Sessions.\nA predefined PCC rule is bound to one and only one QoS Flow per PDU Session. For a predefined PCC rule whose service data flow cannot be fully reflected for the uplink direction in terms of traffic mapping information sent to the UE, the SMF may request the UPF to apply the uplink service data flow detection at additional QoS Flows with non-GBR 5QI of the same PDU Session. The deactivation of such a predefined PCC rule ceases its service data flow detection for the whole PDU Session.\nThe PCF may, at any time, deactivate an active PCC rule in the SMF. At QoS Flow termination all active PCC rules on that QoS Flow are deactivated without explicit instructions from the PCF to do so.\nPolicy and charging control rule operations can be also performed in a deferred mode. A PCC rule may have either a single deferred activation time, or a single deferred deactivation time or both.\nA PCC rule with only a deferred activation time shall be inactive until that time. A PCC rule with only a deferred deactivation time shall be active until that time. When the rule activation time occurs prior to the rule deactivation time, the rule is inactive until the activation and remains active until the deactivation time occurs. When the rule deactivation time occurs prior to the rule activation time, the rule is initially active until the deactivation time, then remains inactive until the activation time, and then becomes active again. An inactive PCC rule, that has not been activated yet, is still considered to be installed, and may be removed by the PCF. When modifying a dynamic PCC rule by setting, modifying or clearing its deferred activation and/or deactivation time or by changing any other attribute of a PCC rule having a deferred activation and/or deactivation time, the PCF shall provide all attributes of that PCC rule, including attributes that have not changed.\nNOTE 2:\tIn this case, the PCF omission of an attribute that has a prior value will erase that attribute from the rule.\nDeferred activation and deactivation of PCC rules can only be used for PCC rules that belong to the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule that allows all UL packets.\nDeferred modification of PCC rules shall not be applied for changes of the QoS or service data flow filter information of PCC rules.\nNOTE 3:\tThis limitation prevents dependencies on the signalling of changed traffic mapping information towards the UE.",

This attributed shall not be forwarded to RAN or UE.\nNOTE 16:\tIncluded if the PDU Session Slice Inactivity Timer value is set by PCF.\nUpon the initial interaction with the SMF, the PCF may provide the following attributes to the SMF:\nThe Charging information contains addresses of the CHF that manages charging for the PDU Session and optionally the associated CHF instance ID and CHF set ID (see clause 6.3.1.0 of TS 23.501 [2]). If received, the SMF shall apply it as defined in clause 6.3.11 of TS 23.501 [2].\nThe Default charging method indicates what charging method shall be used in the PDU Session for every PCC rule where the charging method identifier is omitted, including predefined PCC rules that are activated by the SMF. If received by the SMF, it supersedes the Default charging method in the charging characteristics profile.\nThe PDU Session with offline charging only can be assigned to a PDU Session by the PCF to indicate that the online charging method is never set for any of the PCC Rules activated during the lifetime of the PDU Session nor provided as Default charging method.\nNOTE 1:\tIf this parameter is provided by the PCF or configured in the SMF charging characteristics the SMF can use the Nchf_OfflineOnlyCharging service instead of the Nchf_ConvergedCharging service for a PDU Session as defined in TS 32.255 [21].\nNOTE 2:\tWhen the \"PDU Session with offline charging only\" indication is provisioned by the PCF, the PCF can set the charging method for a PCC rule within this PDU Session to either \"offline\" or \"neither\".\nThe IP Index indicates the IP Address/Prefix allocation method which is used by the SMF for IP Address/Prefix allocation during PDU Session Establishment procedure as defined in clause 5.8.2.2.1 of TS 23.501 [2].\nUpon every interaction with the SMF, the PCF may provide the following attributes to the SMF:\nThe Revalidation time limit defines the time period within which the SMF shall trigger a request for PCC rules for an established PDU Session.\nThe Reflective QoS Timer defines the lifetime of a UE derived QoS rule belonging to the PDU Session. It is used in the UE as defined in clause 5.7.5.3 of TS 23.501 [2].\nNOTE 3:\tThe Reflective QoS Timer that is sent to the UE has to be in alignment with the corresponding timer configured in the UPF (defined in clause 5.7.5.3 of TS 23.501 [2]).\nThe Authorized Session-AMBR defines the UL/DL Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate for the Non-GBR QoS Flows of the PDU Session, which is enforced in the UPF as defined in clause 5.7.1 of TS 23.501 [2]. The PCF may provide the Authorized Session-AMBR in every interaction with the SMF. When the SMF receives it from the PDU Session policy, it is provided to the UPF over N4 interface for the enforcement.\nThe Authorized default 5QI/ARP defines the 5QI and ARP values of the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule as described in clause 6.2.2.4. The PCF may provide a 5QI Priority Level according to clause 5.7.3.3 of TS 23.501 [2] together with the Authorized default 5QI, when a 5QI Priority Level value different from the standardized Default Priority Level value in the QoS characteristics Table 5.7.4-1 of TS 23.501 [2] is required. The SMF applies the Authorized default 5QI/ARP also for the QoS Flow binding as described in clause 6.1.3.2.4.\nThe Time Condition and Subsequent Authorized Session-AMBR / Subsequent Authorized default 5QI/ARP are used together and up to four instances with different values of the Time Condition parameter may be provided by the PCF. Time Condition indicates that the associated Subsequent Authorized Session-AMBR/ Subsequent Authorized default 5QI/ARP is only applied when the time defined by this attribute is met. The PCF may provide a 5QI Priority Level according to clause 5.7.3.3 of TS 23.501 [2] together with the Subsequent Authorized default 5QI, when a 5QI Priority Level value different from the standardized Default Priority Level value in the QoS characteristics Table 5.7.4-1 of TS 23.501 [2] is required. When the SMF receives a Time Condition and Subsequent Authorized Session-AMBR/ Subsequent Authorized default 5QI/ARP pair, it stores it locally. The SMF shall discard any previously received Subsequent Authorized Session-AMBR / Subsequent Authorized default 5QI/ARP instances on explicit instruction as well as whenever the PCF provides a new instruction for one or more Subsequent Authorized Session-AMBR / Subsequent Authorized default 5QI/ARP. When the time defined by the Time Condition parameter is reached, the SMF shall apply (or instruct the UPF to apply) Subsequent Authorized Session-AMBR/ Subsequent Authorized default 5QI/ARP.\nNOTE 4:\tIn order to reduce the risk for signalling overload, the PCF should avoid simultaneous provisioning of the Subsequent Authorized Session-AMBR/ Subsequent Authorized default 5QI/ARP for many UEs (e.g. by spreading over time).\nNOTE 5:\tIn order to provide further Subsequent Authorized Session-AMBR/ Subsequent Authorized default 5QI/ARP in a timely fashion the PCF can use its own clock to issue the desired changes or use the Revalidation time limit parameter to trigger an SMF request for a policy decision.\nNOTE 6:\tFor services that depend on specific Session-AMBR and/or default 5QI/ARP (e.g. MPS session) the PCF is responsible to ensure that no Subsequent Authorized Session-AMBR or Subsequent Authorized default 5QI/ARP interfere with the service, e.g. by removing the Subsequent Authorized Session-AMBR or Subsequent Authorized default 5QI/ARP before the respective change time is reached.\nThe Monitoring Key is the reference to a resource threshold. Any number of PCC Rules may share the same monitoring key value. The monitoring key values for each service shall be operator configurable.\nIt shall also be possible for an operator to use the Monitoring Key parameter to indicate usage monitoring on an PDU Session level or, in the case of an MA PDU Session, to indicate usage monitoring on PDU Session level for the 3GPP access and/or the Non-3GPP access.\nUsage monitoring on PDU Session level is active when a PDU Session is active when a Monitoring Key for the PDU Session and a corresponding volume and/or time threshold value have been provided to the SMF. Usage monitoring on Monitoring key level is active when a volume and/or time threshold has been provided for a Monitoring Key to the SMF and there is at least one PCC rule active for the PDU Session that is associated with that Monitoring Key.\nThe Volume threshold indicates the overall user traffic volume value after which the SMF shall report the Usage threshold reached trigger to the PCF.\nThe Time threshold indicates the overall resource time usage after which the SMF shall report the Usage threshold reached trigger to the PCF.\nThe Monitoring time indicates the time at which the SMF shall store the accumulated usage information.\nThe Subsequent Volume threshold indicates the overall user traffic volume value measured after Monitoring time, after which the SMF shall report the Usage threshold reached trigger to the PCF.\nThe Subsequent Time threshold indicates the overall resource time usage measured after Monitoring time, after which the SMF shall report the Usage threshold reached trigger to the PCF.\nThe Inactivity Detection Time indicates the period of time after which the time measurement shall stop, if no packets are received during that time period.\nThe Port Management Information Container carries Ethernet or IP port management information for an Ethernet/IP port located in DS-TT or NW-TT. The port for which the container is provided is identified by the port number.\nThe User plane node Management Information Container carries User plane node management information for a 5GS Bridge or Router.\nThe VPLMN specific offloading policy carries the attributes for the traffic to be offloaded to the local part of DN in VPLMN.

The procedure in this clause also applies to N5CW devices when accessing a PLMN or an SNPN.\nWhen the UE or N5WC device has valid 3GPP subscription credentials (i.e. a valid USIM or valid SNPN credentials) and WLANSP rules, the UE or N5CW device shall perform WLAN selection based on these rules, the applicable User Preferences On Non-3GPP Access Selection and the corresponding procedures specified in this document. User Preferences On Non-3GPP Access Selection take precedence over the WLANSP rules.\nThe UE or N5CW device determines the most preferred WLAN access network using WLANSP rules when a WLAN access network cannot be selected based on User Preferences On Non-3GPP Access Selection (e.g. when there are no User Preferences On Non-3GPP Access Selection or when there is no user-preferred WLAN access network available).\nThe UE or N5CW device constructs a prioritized list of the available WLANs by discovering the available WLANs and comparing their attributes / capabilities against the groups of selection criteria in the valid WLANSP rule(s). When there are multiple valid WLANSP rules the UE evaluates the valid WLANSP rules in priority order. The UE evaluates first if an available WLAN access meets the criteria of the highest priority valid WLANSP rule. The UE then evaluates if an available WLAN access meets the selection criteria of the next priority valid WLANSP rule.\nWithin a valid WLANSP rule, the WLAN(s) that match the group of selection criteria with the highest priority are considered as the most preferred WLANs, the WLAN(s) that match the group of selection criteria with the second highest priority are considered as the second most preferred WLANs, etc.\nWhen a group of selection criteria includes the HomeNetwork attribute and is set, then the UE or N5CW device (a) shall create a list of available WLANs that directly interwork with the home operator (as specified in clause 4.8.2.1.6 of TS 23.402 [9]) and (b) shall apply the group of selection criteria to all the WLANs in this list. Otherwise, when the HomeNetwork attribute is not set or is not present, the UE or N5CW device shall apply the group of selection criteria to all available WLANs. The UE or N5CW device may need to perform ANQP procedures (as specified in the HS2.0 Rel‑2 specification [ref]) or other procedures in order to discover the attributes / capabilities of the available WLANs.\nWhen the UE is roaming (this implies that it is not operating in SNPN access mode and is not an N5CW device) the UE may have valid WLANSP rules from both the VPLMN and the HPLMN. In such a case the UE gives priority to the valid WLANSP rules from the VPLMN. The UE constructs a prioritised list of the available WLANs when the available WLAN accesses meet the selection criteria of the valid rules from the VPLMN and the valid rules from the HPLMN. The prioritised WLAN accesses based on the WLANSP rules from the HPLMN will have lower priority from the prioritised list of WLAN access based on the WLANSP rules of the VPLMN.",

A URSP rule is determined to be applicable when every component in the Traffic descriptor (for Traffic descriptor components other than the PIN ID) matches the corresponding information from the application, matches the information configured for a PIN (if the URSP rule contains a PIN ID Traffic descriptor component) or matches the information configured for a Connectivity Group (if the URSP rule contains a Connectivity Group ID Traffic descriptor). A URSP rule is determined not to be applicable when for any given component in the Traffic descriptor:\n-\tNo corresponding information from the application/for a PIN/for a Connectivity Group is available; or\n-\tThe corresponding information from the application/for a PIN/for a Connectivity Group does not match any of the values in the Traffic descriptor component.\nNOTE 1:\tIt is recommended to avoid listing more than two components in the Traffic descriptor of a URSP rule.\nIf a URSP rule is provided that contains a Traffic descriptor with two or more components, it is recommended to also provide URSP rule(s) with lower precedence and a Traffic descriptor with less components, in order to increase the likelihood of URSP rule matching for a particular application.\nEach URSP rule contains a list of Route Selection Descriptors containing one or multiple Route Selection Descriptors each having a different Route Selection Descriptor Precedence value. A Route Selection Descriptor contains one or more of the following components:\n-\tSession and Service Continuity (SSC) Mode: Indicates that the traffic of the matching application/PIN shall be routed via a PDU Session supporting the included SSC Mode.\n-\tNetwork Slice Selection: Indicates that the traffic of the matching application/PIN shall be routed via a PDU Session supporting any of the included S-NSSAIs, see clause 5.15.4 in TS 23.501 [2]. It includes one or more S-NSSAI(s).\n-\tDNN Selection: Indicates that the traffic of the matching application/PIN shall be routed via a PDU Session supporting any of the included DNNs. It includes one or more DNN(s). If a DNN Selection component is provided in the Route Selection Descriptor then the UE shall use any of the DNNs of the DNN Selection component, instead of the DNN requested by the application for the PDU Session that is used to route the traffic of the matching application. If there is no DNN Selection component in the Route Selection Descriptor, then the UE shall use the DNN requested by the application for the PDU Session that is used to route the traffic of the matching application.\nNOTE 2:\tTo provide uniform service experience for UEs from earlier Releases, when a USRP rule with a DNN in both, Traffic descriptor and Route Selection Descriptor, is provided to the UEs, the DNN(s) used in the Traffic descriptor would also need to be included in the policy for DNN replacement in the network. In addition, a lower priority Route Selection Descriptor without a DNN would also need to be provided to the UEs.\n-\tPDU Session Type Selection: Indicates that the traffic of matching application/PIN shall be routed via a PDU Session supporting the included PDU Session Type. The possible PDU Session Types are defined in clause 5.6.10 in TS 23.501 [2].\n-\tNon-Seamless Offload indication: Indicates that traffic of the matching application is to be offloaded to non-3GPP access outside of a PDU Session when the rule is applied. If this component is present in a Route Selection Descriptor, no other components shall be included in the Route Selection Descriptor.\n-\tProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay Offload indication: Indicates that the traffic of the matching application is to be sent via a ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay outside of a PDU Session when the rule is applied. If this indication is absent and the ProSe Multipath Preference indication is absent then the traffic matching the URSP rule shall not be sent via a ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay outside of a PDU Session. If this component is present in a Route Selection Descriptor, no other components shall be included in the Route Selection Descriptor.\n-\tProSe Multipath Preference indication: Indicates that the traffic of the matching application is preferred to be sent via a PDU Session over the Uu reference point and a ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay without N3IWF outside of a PDU Session. The traffic of the matching application may be sent via a PDU Session over Uu reference point or via ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay outside of a PDU Session when e.g. one of the paths is not available. If this indication is absent and the ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay Offload indication is absent then the traffic matching of the URSP rule shall not be sent via a ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay outside of a PDU Session. If this component is present in a Route Selection Descriptor, other components can be included in the Route Selection Descriptor to determine the PDU Session over the Uu reference point.\n-\tAccess Type Preference: If the UE needs to establish a PDU Session when the rule is applied, this indicates the Access Type (3GPP or non-3GPP or multi-access) on which the PDU Session should be established. The type \"Multi-Access\" indicates that the PDU Session should be established as a MA PDU Session, using both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access.\nNOTE 3:\tThe Access Type of 3GPP also includes the use of 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay access as defined in TS 23.304 [34]. The Access Type of non-3GPP also includes the use of 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay with N3IWF as defined in TS 23.304 [34].\n-\tPDU Session Pair ID: An indication shared by redundant PDU Sessions as described in clause 5.33.2.1 of TS 23.501 [2].\n-\tRSN: The RSN for redundant PDU Sessions as described in clause 5.33.2.1 of TS 23.501 [2].\nNOTE 4:\tFor backward compatibility, PCF may provide a RSD with PDU Session Pair ID and RSN and a RSD without PDU Session Pair ID and RSN in the URSP rule. In this case, the RSD with PDU Session Pair ID and RSN has a lower precedence value (i.e. higher prioritised) than the one without PDU Session Pair ID. If a non-supporting UE receives the RSD containing PDU Session Pair ID, it ignores this RSD.\nNOTE 5:\tThe UE may also set the PDU Session Pair ID and RSN parameters based on UE implementation as described in clause 5.33.2.1 of TS 23.501 [2].\n-\tTime Window: The Route Selection Descriptor is not be considered valid unless the UE is in the time window.\n-\tLocation Criteria: The Route Selection Descriptor is not be considered valid unless the UE's location matches the Location Criteria.\nNOTE 6:\tThe structure of the URSP does not define how the PCF splits the URSP when URSP cannot be delivered to the UE in a single NAS message.\nNOTE 7:\tIt is expected that UE applications will not be able to change or override the PDU Session parameters in the URSP rules. A UE application can express preferences when it requests a network connection (e.g. certain Connection Capabilities), which can be mapped into specific PDU Session parameters by the URSP rules.\nNOTE 8:\tA Route Selection Descriptor can include a Time Window and/or a Location Criteria or neither a Time Window nor a Location Criteria. A URSP rule can include RSDs with or without validation criteria at the same time.\nIn the case of network rejection of the PDU Session Establishment Request, the UE may trigger a new PDU Session establishment based on the rejection cause and the URSP policy.\nWhen the PCF provisions URSP rules to the UE, one URSP rule with a \"match all\" Traffic descriptor may be included.\nNOTE 9:\tWhen URSP rules containing NSSP are available to the UE and the URSP rule with the \"match all\" Traffic descriptor is not part of them, a UE application that has no matching URSP rule and no UE Local Configuration cannot request a network connection.\nThe URSP rule with the \"match all\" Traffic descriptor is used to route the traffic of applications which do not match any other URSP rules and shall therefore be evaluated as the last URSP rule, i.e. with lowest priority. There shall be only one Route Selection Descriptor in this URSP rule. The Route Selection Descriptor in this URSP rule includes at most one value for each Route Selection Component.\nNOTE 10:\tHow to set the URSP rule with the \"match all\" Traffic descriptor as the URSP rule with lowest priority is defined in TS 24.526 [19].\nNOTE 11:\tThe URSP rule with the \"match all\" Traffic descriptor is not applicable to PINE traffic.\nIf a URSP rule is provided with an Indication for reporting URSP rule enforcement, the UE follows the procedures specified in clause 6.6.2.4.",

In addition, the UE may be also pre-configured with URSP rules for the SNPN (e.g. by the operator of the SNPN).\nWhen an SNPN-enabled UE accesses an SNPN using credentials from a Credentials Holder (CH), the UE may also be provisioned (signalled) with URSP rules for the SNPN by the PCF of the SNPN. However, the UE may be required to not accept URSP rules signalled by any SNPN that the UE accesses using CH credentials from a CH as specified in TS 24.501 [22], as follows:\n-\tby (pre-)configuration by the PLMN or SNPN of which the CH is part of (when applicable); or\n-\tby provisioning (signalling) by the PLMN or SNPN of which the CH is part of, when the UE is registered in that PLMN or SNPN.\nNOTE 1:\tA network (PLMN or SNPN) when operating as a CH (see clause 5.30.2.9 of TS 23.501 [2]) does not provide PCF functionality i.e. the PCF of this network cannot provision (signal) URSP rules to the UE when the UE is accessing an SNPN using CH credentials from this network operating as a CH.\nIf a UE accesses an SNPN using credentials from a CH, the UE applies URSP rules as follows:\n-\tThe UE first evaluates (in precedence order) the URSP rules, if any, provisioned (signalled) by the PCF of this SNPN, except the URSP rule with the \"match all\" Traffic descriptor, following the procedure described in clause 6.6.2.3.\n-\tIf none of the above URSP rules received from this SNPN match, or if there is no URSP rules except the URSP rule with the \"match all\" Traffic descriptor received from this SNPN (or if the UE is required to not accept any URSP rules from any SNPN), then the UE evaluates (in precedence order) the URSP rules, if any, provisioned (signalled) by the PCF of the network (HPLMN or SNPN) holding the credentials when previously registered in the network holding the credentials, except the URSP rule with the \"match all\" Traffic descriptor, following the procedure described in clause 6.6.2.3.\n-\tIf there is no matching URSP rules according to the above, the UE uses UE Local Configuration if any.\n-\tIf no UE Local Configuration matches or there is no UE Local Configuration, the UE applies the URSP rule with the \"match all\" Traffic descriptor as follows:\n-\tThe UE first uses the URSP rule with the \"match all\" Traffic descriptor, if any, provisioned (signalled) by the PCF of this SNPN, following the procedure described in clause 6.6.2.3.\n-\tIf there is no URSP rule with the \"match all\" Traffic descriptor from provisioned (signalled) by the PCF of this SNPN, then the UE uses the URSP rule with the \"match all\" Traffic descriptor, if any, provisioned (signalled) by the PCF of the network (HPLMN or SNPN) holding the credentials when previously registered in the network holding the credentials, following the procedure described in clause 6.6.2.3.\nThe UE keeps the received UE policies stored even when registering in another SNPN.

      "content": "For every newly detected application/PIN the UE evaluates the URSP rules in the order of Rule Precedence and determines if the application/PIN is matching the Traffic descriptor of any URSP rule. When a URSP rule is determined to be applicable for a given application/PIN (see clause 6.6.2.1), the UE shall select a Route Selection Descriptor within this URSP rule in the order of the Route Selection Descriptor Precedence.\nWhen a valid Route Selection Descriptor is found, the UE determines if there is an existing PDU Session that matches all components in the selected Route Selection Descriptor. The UE compares the components of the selected Route Selection Descriptor with the existing PDU Session(s) as follows:\n-\tFor a component which only contains one value (e.g. SSC mode), the value of the PDU Session has to be identical to the value specified in the Route Selection Descriptor.\n-\tFor a component which contains a list of values (e.g. Network Slice Selection), the value of the PDU Session has to be identical to one of the values specified in the Route Selection Descriptor.\n-\tWhen some component(s) is not present in the Route Selection Descriptor, a PDU Session is considered matching only if it was established without including the missing component(s) in the PDU Session Establishment Request.\n-\tWhen the Route Selection Descriptor includes a Time Window or a Location Criteria, the PDU Session is considered matching only if the PDU Session is associated with an RSD that has the same Time Window or a Location Criteria Validity Conditions.\nWhen a matching PDU Session exists the UE associates the application/PIN to the existing PDU Session, i.e. route the traffic of the detected application/PIN on this PDU Session.\nIf the UE determines that there is more than one existing PDU Session which matches (e.g. the selected Route Selection Descriptor only specifies the Network Slice Selection, while there are multiple existing PDU Sessions matching the Network Slice Selection with different DNNs), it is up to UE implementation to select one of them to use.\nNOTE 1:\tWhen more than one PDU Sessions of SSC mode 3 to the same DNN and S-NSSAI exist due to PDU Session anchor change procedure as described in clause 4.3.5.2 of TS 23.502 [3], the UE can take the PDU Session Address Lifetime value into account when selecting the PDU Session.\nIf none of the existing PDU Sessions matches, the UE tries to establish a new PDU Session using the values specified by the selected Route Selection Descriptor. If the PDU Session Establishment Request is accepted, the UE associates the application/PIN to this new PDU Session. If the PDU Session Establishment Request is rejected, based on the rejection cause, the UE selects another combination of values in the currently selected Route Selection Descriptor if any other value for the rejected component in the same Route Selection Descriptor can be used. Otherwise, the UE selects the next Route Selection Descriptor, which contains a combination of component value which is not rejected by network, in the order of the Route Selection Descriptor Precedence, if any. If the UE fails to establish a PDU Session with any of the Route Selection Descriptors, it tries other URSP rules in the order of Rule Precedence with matching Traffic descriptors, except the URSP rule with the \"match-all\" Traffic descriptor, if any. The UE shall not use the UE Local Configuration in this case.\nNOTE 2:\tAn application can match the Traffic descriptor of different URSP rules and be associated with different PDU Sessions simultaneously.\nIf a UE receives tuple(s) (PLMN ID, list of PSIs associated with the PLMN ID), the UE uses the URSP rules associated with the PSIs indicated in the tuple(s) as VPLMN specific URSP rules and the UE uses the URSP rules associated with the PSI not indicated in the tuple(s) as non-VPLMN specific URSP rules.\nIf a UE receives VPLMN specific URSP rules and non-VPLMN specific URSP rules (i.e. the URSP rules which are applicable to both HPLMN and VPLMN), the VPLMN specific URSP rules take precedence over the non-VPLMN specific URSP rules and Local UE Configuration and any other URSP rules provided to the UE. The UE determines VPLMN specific URSP rules to be used taking serving PLMN ID into consideration. If the UE does not find a match to the VPLMN specific URSP rules associated to serving PLMN ID, then the UE uses the VPLMN specific URSP rules associated to the equivalent serving PLMN ID, if any. Otherwise, the UE uses the non-VPLMN specific URSP rules.\nThe UE receives the updated URSP rules and (re-)evaluates their validities in a timely manner when certain conditions are met, for example:\n-\tthe URSP is updated by the PCF;\n-\tthe UE moves from EPC to 5GC;\n-\tchange of Allowed NSSAI or Configured NSSAI;\n-\tchange of LADN DNN availability;\n-\tchange of PLMN;\n-\tUE registers over 3GPP or non-3GPP access;\n-\tUE establishes a connection with a ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay;\n-\tUE establishes connection to a WLAN access.\nDetails of the conditions are defined by TS 24.526 [19].\nNOTE 3:\tWhen providing the updated URSP rules to the UE with a new DNN, the PCF can set the SMF selection management trigger in the AMF to contact the PCF at PDU Session establishment (as specified in clause 6.1.2.5) if the old DNN is requested by the UE.\nThe Route Selection Descriptor of a URSP rule shall be only considered valid if all of the following conditions are fulfilled:\n1)\tIf any S-NSSAI(s) is present, the S-NSSAI(s) is in the Allowed NSSAI or in the Partially Allowed NSSAI for the non-roaming case and in the mapping of the Allowed NSSAI (or of the Partially Allowed NSSAI) to HPLMN S-NSSAI(s) for the roaming case.\n2)\tIf any DNN is present and the DNN is an LADN DNN, the UE is in the area of availability of this LADN.\n3)\tIf Access Type preference is present and set to Multi-Access, the UE supports ATSSS.\n4)\tIf a Time Window is present and the time matches what is indicated in the Time Window.\n5)\tIf a Location Criteria is present and the UE location matches what is indicated in the Location Criteria.\n6)\tIf ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay Offload indication is present and the UE supports the ProSe capability of 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE.\n7)\tIf ProSe Multipath Preference indication is present and the UE supports the ProSe capability of 5G ProSe Layer-3 Remote UE.\nIf none of the conditions in bullet 1) are met for all the S-NSSAI(s) in the RSD during the validation of the route selection descriptor, the UE shall attempt to meet the condition by requesting any of the S-NSSAI(s) in the RSD through a Mobility Registration Update procedure to attempt to add the S-NSSAI(s) to the Allowed NSSAI (or to the Partially Allowed NSSAI), as specified in clause 5.15.5.2.2 of TS 23.501 [2]. The UE attempts the Mobility Registration Update for a S-NSSAI only if the S-NSSAI is in the Configured NSSAI or, in the roaming case, in the mapping of the S-NSSAIs of the Configured NSSAI for the VPLMN to the corresponding S-NSSAI values of the HPLMN, and any other restrictions to prevent triggering Mobility Registration Update as defined in TS 24.501 [22].\nIf a matching URSP rule has no valid RSD, the UE tries other URSP rules in the order of Rule Precedence with matching Traffic descriptors, except the URSP rule with \"match-all\" Traffic descriptor. The UE shall not use the UE Local Configuration in this case.\nWhen URSP rules are updated or their validity according to the conditions above change, the association of existing applications/PINs to PDU Sessions may need to be re-evaluated. The UE may also re-evaluate the application/PIN to PDU Session association due to the following reasons:\n-\tperiodic re-evaluation based on UE implementation;\n-\tan existing PDU Session that is used for routing traffic of an application/PIN based on a URSP rule is released;\n-\tThe expiration of Time Window in Route Selection Validation Criteria, i.e. the expiration of Time Window, or UE's location no longer matches the Location Criteria.\n-\tchange of PLMN.\nNOTE 4:\tIt is up to UE implementation to avoid frequent re-evaluation due to location change.\nIf the re-evaluation leads to a change of the application/PIN to PDU Session association, e.g. the application/PIN is to be associated with another PDU Session or a new PDU Session needs to be established, the UE may enforce such changes in a timely manner based on implementation, e.g. immediately or when UE enters CM-IDLE state.\nIf the selected Route Selection Descriptor contains a Non-Seamless Offload indication and the UE has established a connection to a WLAN access, the UE routes the traffic matching the Traffic descriptor of the URSP rule via the WLAN access outside of a PDU Session.\nIf the selected Route Selection Descriptor contains a ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay Offload indication and the UE has established a connection with a ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay, the UE routes the traffic matching the Traffic descriptor of the URSP rule (including the URSP rule with the \"match-all\" Traffic descriptor) via the ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay outside of a PDU Session.\nThe 5G-RG and FN-RG procedure for associating applications to PDU Sessions based on URSP is defined in clause 9.5.2 of TS 23.316 [27].",

      "content": "The UE may report URSP rule enforcement to PCF, so that PCF will be made aware about the URSP rule enforcement when a given UE enforces specific URSP rule(s) and the PCF may trigger an action upon the reception of such reporting.\nIn order to activate the URSP rule enforcement reporting for a URSP rule (containing Connection Capabilities in the Traffic descriptor, see clause 6.6.2.1), for a UE indicating the capability of reporting URSP rule enforcement to network (see clause 4.2.2.2.2 of TS 23.502 [3]), the PCF sets the Indication for reporting URSP rule enforcement in a URSP rule sent to the UE (see clause 6.6.2.1).\nNOTE 1:\tThe format and values of the Traffic descriptor component type identifier are defined in clause 5.2 of TS 24.526 [19].\nA UE supporting URSP rule enforcement reporting shall send a URSP rule enforcement report to the SMF for a URSP rule which includes an Indication for reporting URSP rule enforcement as well as Connection Capabilities in the Traffic descriptor (see clause 6.6.2.1). The UE shall send a URSP rule enforcement report, i.e. all Connection Capabilities contained in the Traffic descriptor of the associated URSP rule, to the SMF when:\n-\tthe UE associates a newly detected application to a new PDU Session (based on URSP evaluation result (see clause 6.6.2.3) for such a URSP rule), by including the URSP rule enforcement report in the PDU Session Establishment Request (see clause 4.3.2.2.1 of TS 23.502 [3]); or\n-\tthe UE associates a newly detected application to an existing PDU Session (based on URSP evaluation result (see clause 6.6.2.3) for such a URSP rule), by sending the PDU Session Modification Request (see clause 4.3.3.2 of TS 23.502 [3]) including the URSP rule enforcement report; or\n-\tthe UE changes the association of an application to a PDU Session (based on the URSP re-evaluation result (see clause 6.6.2.3) for such a URSP rule), by including the URSP rule enforcement report in a PDU Session Establishment (see clause 4.3.2.2.1 of TS 23.502 [3]) or by sending a PDU Session Modification Request (see clause 4.3.3.2 of TS 23.502 [3]) including the URSP rule enforcement report; or\n-\tthe UE has the association of an application to a PDN Connection/PDU Session in EPC (based on the URSP evaluation result (see clause 6.6.2.3) for such a URSP rule) and the UE moves from EPS to 5GS, by including the URSP rule enforcement report in a PDU Session Establishment Request (for the case without N26, see the step 9 of Figure 4.11.2.3-1 of TS 23.502 [3]) or by sending a PDU Session Modification Request (for the case with N26, see clause 4.3.3.2 of TS 23.502 [3]) including the URSP rule enforcement report.\nNOTE 2:\tUE reporting of URSP rule enforcement can increase the amount of signalling in the network. Use of this feature is recommended to be restricted to URSP rules for specific application traffic on specific UEs based on the deployment choices of the operator.\nIf the UE enforces several URSP rules for multiple applications, and these multiple applications are all associated to the same established PDU Session, in order to reduce the number of uplink NAS messages, the UE may include more than one URSP rule enforcement report in the PDU Session Modification Request (see clause 4.3.3.2 of TS 23.502 [3]) and each URSP rule enforcement report includes all Connection Capabilities contained in the Traffic descriptor of the associated URSP rule.\nThe PCF receives the URSP rule enforcement report for a given UE via SM Policy Association Establishment procedure or via SM Policy Association Modification procedure according to the Policy Control Request Trigger \"UE reporting Connection Capabilities from associated URSP rule\" (see clause 6.1.3.5).\nWhen the PCF serving a given UE is configured to use UE reporting of URSP rule enforcement for this UE and the configuration does not guarantee that the PCF serving the PDU Session is the same as the (H-)PCF serving the UE, then the (H-)PCF serving the UE subscribes to the PCF serving the PDU Session to receive the URSP rule enforcement report for the UE via PCF event reporting (see clause 6.1.3.18 and the related procedure in clause 4.16.16.2 of TS 23.502 [3]).\nFor LBO roaming session case, the H-PCF for the UE requests to forward UE reporting Connection Capabilities from an associated URSP rule to the V-PCF for the UE to receive the URSP rule enforcement report via PCF event reporting (see clause 6.1.3.18) during the UE Policy Association Establishment or Modification (see clause 4.16.16.3 of TS 23.502 [3]).\nThe PCF for the UE may check whether the URSP rule enforcement report and the relate PDU Session parameters (e.g. DNN/S-NSSAI) are compliant to the corresponding URSP rule of the UE. The PCF may perform the following actions:\n-\tTo identify at least one of the URSP rule sent to the UE, the PCF compares the value of the URSP rule enforcement with the Connection Capabilities in all the URSP Rules, that includes \"the Indication for reporting URSP rule enforcement\" set and are provisioned to the UE.\n-\tTo identify the RSD in the URSP rule used for the establishment/modification of the PDU Session, the PCF compares the PDU Session parameters with the Route Selection Components of each RSD in the identified URSP rule as follows: the Requested DNN and the S-NSSAI of the HPLMN in the PDU Session parameters is compared with the DNN included in the DNN selection and the list of S-NSSAI(s) in the Network Slice Selection, if any. The SSC mode and the PDU Session type in the PDU Session parameters with the SSC Mode and PDU Session type selection in the Route Selection Component.\nIf the PCF for the UE found an inconsistency in the PDU Session parameters, e.g., the Requested S-NSSAI are not matching the any Route Selection Component in an RSD of the identified URSP Rule, the PCF for the UE may perform additional check (e.g. check the Selected S-NSSAI) and may perform appropriate actions (e.g. initiating slice replacement procedure).\nNOTE 3:\tThe identification of the URSP rule sent to the UE using the URSP rule enforcement information by the PCF can fail if the same list of Connection Capabilities is included in more that one URSP Rule with the Indication for reporting URSP rule enforcement. The possible actions at the PCF are implementation specific.\nNOTE 4:\tThe PCF cannot check the Route Selection Validation Criteria, given that the UE can delay the reporting of the URSP Rule to reduce the amount of generated signalling.\nPolicy control decisions based on awareness of URSP rule enforcement are described in clause 6.1.1.5.\nThe USRP rule enforcement reporting is not supported by 5G-RG and FN-RG.",

The DRA can be a consumer of Nbsf services and the BSF can provide binding functionality for different subscribers. When the AF using Rx, such as P-CSCF, sends Rx request to the DRA, if the DRA has no binding information for the subscriber, based on configuration or via NRF, it selects the BSF. Then the DRA can query the BSF by invoking Nbsf_Management discovery service operation, to get the relevant PCF address, based on which the DRA routes the Rx request to the selected PCF.\nNOTE:\tThe DRA decides to select a BSF based on user IP address range.\nAnnex C (Normative):Support for Application Functions supporting Rx interface\nTo allow the 5G system to interwork with AFs related to existing services, e.g. IMS based services as described in TS 23.228 [5], Mission Critical Push To Talk services as described in TS 23.179 [6], the PCF shall support the corresponding IMS procedures defined in the main body of this TS via Rx interface. This facilitates the migration from EPC to 5GC without requiring these AFs to upgrade to support the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization services in Rel-16.\nFigure C-1: Interworking between 5G Policy framework and AFs supporting Rx interface\nSession Binding applies for PDU Sessions of IP type only.\nThe functionality described for Multimedia Priority Services (clause 6.1.3.11) and Mission Critical service (clause 6.1.3.19) applies via Rx interface.\nIn order to support IMS Emergency services over Rx interface, in addition to the functional description in clause 6.1.3.10, the following applies: The PCF shall provide the IMEI and the subscriber identifiers (IMSI, MSISDN) (if available), received from the SMF at PDU Session establishment, if so requested by the P-CSCF. The PCF derives the IMEI from the PEI, the IMSI from the SUPI and the MSISDN from the GPSI.\nNOTE 1:\tTS 23.501 [2] defines both 5G identifiers, SUPI, PEI and GPSI and then how they are allocated to allow interworking with functional entities not supporting 5G identifies such as P-CSCF.\nAny AF using Rx, such as P-CSCF, the BSF determines the selected PCF address according to the information included in the incoming Rx requests and the information stored at the BSF. The BSF is able to proxy or redirect Rx requests targeting an IP address of a UE to the selected PCF.\nThe following event reporting is supported over Rx interface:\nTable C-1: Events relevant for reporting from the PCF\nEvent\nDescription\nAvailability for Rx Session\nPLMN Identifier Notification\nThe PLMN identifier where the UE is currently located.\nYes\nChange of Access Type\nThe Access Type and, if applicable, the RAT Type of the PDU Session has changed.\nYes\nEPS fallback\nEPS fallback is initiated\nYes\nSignalling path status\nThe status of the resources related to the signalling traffic of the AF session.\nYes\nAccess Network Charging Correlation Information\nThe Access Network Charging Correlation Information of the resources allocated for the AF session.\nYes\nAccess Network Information Notification\nThe user location and/or timezone when the PDU Session has changed in relation to the AF session.\nYes\nReporting Usage for Sponsored Data Connectivity\nThe usage threshold provided by the AF has been reached; or the AF session is terminated.\nYes\nResource allocation status\nThe status of the resources related to the AF session (established/released).\nYes\nQoS targets can no longer (or can again) be fulfilled\nThe QoS targets can no longer (or can again) be fulfilled by the network for (a part of) the AF session.\nNo\nOut of credit\nCredit is no longer available.\nYes\nAnnex D (informative):PCC usage for sponsored data connectivity\nD.1\tGeneral\nWith sponsored data connectivity, the Sponsor has a business relationship with the operator and the Sponsor reimburses the operator for the user's data connectivity in order to allow the user access to an associated Application Service Provider's (ASP) services. Alternatively, the user pays for the connectivity with a transaction which is separate from the subscriber's charging. It is assumed the user already has a subscription with the operator.\nA possible deployment configuration for sponsored data connectivity in the non-roaming case is illustrated in Figure D.1-1.\nNOTE 1:\tSponsored data connectivity is not supported in the roaming with visited access scenario in this Release.\nFigure D.1-1: Deployment for sponsored data connectivity\nThe relationship between the AF and Sponsor and between the Sponsor and ASP is out of scope of this specification. A single AF can serve multiple ASPs and multiple sponsors.\nNOTE 2:\tAn ASP can also be a sponsor.\nThe sponsor may choose to supply the PCF (via the AF) with the usage thresholds that it expects the SMF to enforce. Alternatively, the Sponsor can allow the ASP to enforce such control over the sponsored data connectivity.\nThe information required for the detection of sponsored HTTP traffic (i.e. server host name) can be verified with the corresponding server IP address/prefix of the IP packets by the SMF. The SMF uses implementation specific logic to perform this verification.\nD.2\tReporting for sponsored data connectivity\nThere are two deployment scenarios for usage reporting for sponsored data connectivity. The Sponsor Identifier and Application Service Provider Identifier are provided for sponsored services to the PCF from the AF over the Rx/N5 interface.\nIn the first scenario the PCF assigns a service specific Charging Key for a sponsored IP flow. The Charging key is used by the SMF to generate separate accounting records for offline charging and and/or usage data records for online charging for the sponsored flows. Correlation of accounting records and usage data records from multiple users per sponsor and/or application service provider is then performed using the charging key.\nIn a second scenario the Sponsor Identifier and Application Service Provider Identity is included in PCC rules from the PCF to the SMF as defined in clause 6.3.1. For this scenario the same Charging Key may be used both for IP flows that are sponsored and for flows that are not sponsored. Accounting records generated by the SMF for offline charging include the Sponsor Identity and the Application Service Provider Identity. Correlation of accounting records from multiple users per sponsor and/or application service provider can then be based on Sponsor Identity and Application Service Provider Identity instead of the Charging Key. Usage reporting for online charging including Sponsor Identity and Application Service Provider Identity has not been specified in this release of the specification. PCC rules that include a Sponsor Identity and an Application Service Provider Identity should include a Charging Method that indicates offline charging.\nAnnex E (informative):Change history\nChange
