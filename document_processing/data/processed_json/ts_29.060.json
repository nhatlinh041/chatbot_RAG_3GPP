      "content": "From release 8 onwards, the normative specification of the user plane of GTP version 1 is 3GPP TS 29.281 [41]. All provisions about GTPv1 user plane in the present document shall be superseded by 3GPP TS 29.281 [41].\nThe present document defines the GPRS Tunnelling Protocol (GTP), i.e. the protocol between GPRS Support Nodes (GSNs) in the UMTS/GPRS backbone network. It includes both the GTP control plane (GTP-C) and data transfer (GTP-U) procedures. GTP also lists the messages and information elements used by the GTP based charging protocol GTP', which is described in 3GPP TS 32.295 [33].\nGTP (GTP-C and GTP-U) is defined for the Gn interface, i.e. the interface between GSNs within a PLMN, and for the Gp interface between GSNs in different PLMNs. Only GTP-U is defined for the Iu interface between Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) and the UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN).\nGTP-C is also used for roaming and inter access mobility between Gn/Gp SGSNs and MMEs as specified in Annex D of 3GPP TS 23.401 [47].\nOn the Iu interface, the Radio Access Network Application Part (RANAP) protocol and signalling part of GTP-U are performing the control function for user plane (GTP-U).\nGTP' is defined for the interface between CDR generating functional network elements and Charging Gateway(s) within a PLMN. Charging Gateway(s) and GTP' protocol are optional, as the Charging Gateway Functionality may either be located in separate network elements (Charging Gateways), or alternatively be embedded into the CDR generating network elements (GSNs) when the GSN-CGF interface is not necessarily visible outside the network element. These interfaces relevant to GTP are between the grey boxes shown in figure 1.\nFigure 1: GPRS Logical Architecture with interface name denotations\nGTP allows multi-protocol packets to be tunnelled through the UMTS/GPRS Backbone between GSNs and between SGSN and UTRAN.\nIn the control plane, GTP specifies a tunnel control and management protocol (GTP-C) which allows the SGSN to provide packet data network access for an MS. Control Plane signalling is used to create, modify and delete tunnels. GTP also allows creation, and deletion of a single multicast service tunnel, that can be used for delivering packets to all the users who have joined a particular multicast service.\nIn the user plane, GTP uses a tunnelling mechanism (GTP-U) to provide a service for carrying user data packets.\nThe GTP-U protocol is implemented by SGSNs and GGSNs in the UMTS/GPRS Backbone and by Radio Network Controllers (RNCs) in the UTRAN. SGSNs and GGSNs in the UMTS/GPRS Backbone implement the GTP-C protocol. No other systems need to be aware of GTP. UMTS/GPRS MSs are connected to an SGSN without being aware of GTP.\nIt is assumed that there will be a many-to-many relationship between SGSNs and GGSNs. A SGSN may provide service to many GGSNs. A single GGSN may associate with many SGSNs to deliver traffic to a large number of geographically diverse mobile stations.",

      "section_title": "GTP Header",
      "content": "The GTP header is a variable length header used for both the GTP-C and the GTP-U protocols. The minimum length of the GTP header is 8 bytes. There are three flags that are used to signal the presence of additional optional fields: the PN flag, the S flag and the E flag. The PN flag is used to signal the presence of N-PDU Numbers. The S flag is used to signal the presence of the GTP Sequence Number field. The E flag is used to signal the presence of the Extension Header field, used to enable future extensions of the GTP header defined in this document, without the need to use another version number. If and only if one or more of these three flags are set, the fields Sequence Number, N-PDU and Extension Header shall be present. The sender shall set all the bits of the unused fields to zero. The receiver shall not evaluate the unused fields.\nThe GTP-C and the GTP-U use some of the fields in the GTP header differently. The detailed use of such fields is described in the clauses related to GTP-C and to GTP-U.\nAlways present fields:\n-\tVersion field: This field is used to determine the version of the GTP protocol. For the treatment of other versions, see clause 11.1.1, \"Different GTP versions\". The version number shall be set to \"1\".\n-\tProtocol Type (PT): This bit is used as a protocol discriminator between GTP (when PT is \"1\") and GTP' (when PT is \"0\"). GTP is described in this document and the GTP' protocol in 3GPP TS 32.295 [33]. Note that the interpretation of the header fields may be different in GTP' than in GTP.\n-\tExtension Header flag (E): This flag indicates the presence of a meaningful value of the Next Extension Header field. When it is set to \"0\", the Next Extension Header field either is not present or, if present, shall not be interpreted. When it is set to \"1\", the Next Extension Header field is present, and shall be interpreted, as described below in this clause.\n-\tSequence number flag (S): This flag indicates the presence of a meaningful value of the Sequence Number field. When it is set to \"0\", the Sequence Number field either is not present or, if present, shall not be interpreted. When it is set to \"1\", the Sequence Number field is present, and shall be interpreted, as described below in this clause.\n-\tN-PDU Number flag (PN): This flag indicates the presence of a meaningful value of the N-PDU Number field. When it is set to \"0\", the N-PDU Number field either is not present, or, if present, shall not be interpreted. When it is set to \"1\", the N-PDU Number field is present, and shall be interpreted, as described below in this clause.\n-\tMessage Type: This field indicates the type of GTP message. The valid values of the message type are defined in clause 7.1 for both GTP-C and GTP-U.\n-\tLength: This field indicates the length in octets of the payload, i.e. the rest of the packet following the mandatory part of the GTP header (that is the first 8 octets). The Sequence Number, the N-PDU Number or any Extension headers shall be considered to be part of the payload, i.e. included in the length count.\n-\tTunnel Endpoint Identifier (TEID): This field unambiguously identifies a tunnel endpoint in the receiving GTP‑U or GTP-C protocol entity. The receiving end side of a GTP tunnel locally assigns the TEID value the transmitting side has to use. The TEID values are exchanged between tunnel endpoints using GTP-C (or RANAP, over the Iu) messages.\nOptional fields:\n-\tSequence Number: This field is an optional field in G -PDUs. It is used as a transaction identity for  signalling messages  having a response message defined for a request message, that is the Sequence Number value is copied from the request to the response message header. In the user plane, an increasing sequence number for T-PDUs is transmitted via GTP-U tunnels, when transmission order must be preserved.\n-\tN-PDU Number: This field is used at the Inter SGSN Routeing Area Update procedure and some inter-system handover procedures (e.g. between 2G and 3G radio access networks). This field is used to co-ordinate the data transmission for acknowledged mode of communication between the MS and the SGSN. The exact meaning of this field depends upon the scenario. (For example, for GSM/GPRS to GSM/GPRS, the SNDCP N-PDU number is present in this field).\n-\tNext Extension Header Type: This field defines the type of Extension Header that follows this field in the GTP‑PDU.\nBits\nOctets\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n1\nVersion\nPT\n(*)\nE\nS\nPN\n2\nMessage Type\n3\nLength (1st Octet)\n4\nLength (2nd Octet)\n5\nTunnel Endpoint Identifier (1st Octet)\n6\nTunnel Endpoint Identifier (2nd Octet)\n7\nTunnel Endpoint Identifier (3rd Octet)\n8\nTunnel Endpoint Identifier (4th Octet)\n9\nSequence Number (1st Octet)1) 4)\n10\nSequence Number (2nd Octet)1) 4)\n11\nN-PDU Number2) 4)\n12\nNext Extension Header Type3) 4)\nNOTE 0:\t(*) This bit is a spare bit.

If the SGSN has already confirmed successful assignment of its Tunnel Endpoint Identifier Control Plane to the peer GGSN, this field shall not be present. The SGSN confirms successful assignment of its Tunnel Endpoint Identifier Control Plane the GGSN when it receives any message with its assigned Tunnel Endpoint Identifier Control Plane in the GTP header from the GGSN.\nThe MSISDN of the MS shall be passed to the GGSN inside the Create PDP Context Request for a PDP Context Activation procedure other than the Secondary PDP Context Activation procedure. This additional information can be used when a secure access to a remote application residing on a server is needed. The GGSN would be in fact able to provide the user identity (i.e. the MSISDN) to the remote application server, providing it with the level of trust granted to users through successfully performing the GPRS authentication procedures, without having to re-authenticate the user at the application level. If no MSISDN is provided by the HSS, the MSISDN shall take the dummy MSISDN value (see clause 3 of 3GPP TS 23.003 [2]) in the aforementioned procedure.\nIf the MS requests a dynamic PDP address and a dynamic PDP address is allowed, then the PDP Address field in the End User Address information element shall be empty. If the MS requests a static PDP Address then the PDP Address field in the End User Address information element shall contain the static PDP Address. In case the PDP addresses carried in the End User Address and optionally in the Protocol Configuration Option information element contain contradicting information, the PDP address carried in the End User Address information element takes the higher precedence. The Quality of Service Profile information element shall be the QoS values to be negotiated between the MS and the SGSN at PDP Context activation. The Evolved Allocation/Retention Priority I information element include the negotiated Evolved Allocation/Retention Priority based on the subscribed one received via Gr interface and SGSN capabilities if the SGSN supports it and if the support of Evolved Allocation/Retention Priority has been indicated by the current GGSN or if the SGSN has no information if GGSN supports Evolved Allocation/Retention Priority. If the SGSN has ever indicated the support of the eARP IE towards a GGSN, it then shall include it in all subsequent GTP messages (i.e. Create PDP Context Request and Update PDP Context Request) towards the same GGSN for a given PDN connection, assuming the eARP remains valid within the subscription and that GGSN supports eARP. The APN-AMBR IE shall be included based on the subscribed one received via Gr interface from the HLR and SGSN capabilities if the SGSN supports this IE.\nThe SGSN shall include an SGSN Address for control plane and an SGSN address for user traffic, which may differ from that provided by the underlying network service (e.g. IP). The GGSN shall store these SGSN Addresses and use them when sending control plane on this GTP tunnel or G-PDUs to the SGSN for the MS.\nThe SGSN shall include a Recovery information element into the Create PDP Context Request if the SGSN is in contact with the GGSN for the very first time or if the SGSN has restarted recently and the new Restart Counter value has not yet been indicated to the GGSN. The GGSN that receives a Recovery information element in the Create PDP Context Request message element shall handle it in the same way as when receiving an Echo Response message. The Create PDP Context Request message shall be considered as a valid activation request for the PDP context included in the message.\nThe SGSN shall include either the MS provided APN, a subscribed APN or an SGSN selected APN in the message; the Access Point Name may be used by the GGSN to differentiate accesses to different external networks.\nThe Selection Mode information element shall indicate the origin of the APN in the message.\nFor contexts created by the Secondary PDP Context Activation Procedure the SGSN shall include the linked NSAPI. Linked NSAPI indicates the NSAPI assigned to any one of the already activated PDP contexts for this PDN connection. If the requested PDP type is allowed by subscription and if the requested PDP type is IPv4v6, the SGSN sets the PDP type as requested if the GGSN supports PDP type IPv4v6. Otherwise, the SGSN shall set the PDP type to IPv4 or IPv6 where the selection between IPv4 and IPv6 is based on the result of the check.\nNOTE 1:\tThe check for PDP type IPv4v6 is implementation specific and configuration may be shared in roaming agreements.\nNOTE 2:\tA Gn/Gp SGSN assumes coherent support for PDP type IPv4v6 across all SGSNs in a PLMN.\nThe Secondary PDP Context Activation Procedure may be executed without providing a Traffic Flow Template (TFT) to the newly activated PDP context if all other active PDP contexts for this PDN connection already have an associated TFT, otherwise a TFT shall be provided. TFT is used for packet filtering in the GGSN.\nWhen using the Secondary PDP Context Activation Procedure, the Selection mode, IMSI, MSISDN, End User Address, Access Point Name and APN Restriction information elements shall not be included in the message.\nIf available, the IMSI shall be passed to the GGSN inside the Create PDP Context Request for a PDP Context Activation procedure other than the Secondary PDP Context Activation procedure.\nIf the MS is emergency attached and the MS is UICCless (i.e. the mobile terminal cannot obtain IMSI at all) or the IMSI is unauthenticated, the International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) shall be used as the MS identity. If the MS is emergency attached and the MS is UICCless, the IMSI cannot be included in the message and therefore IMSI shall not be included in the message.\nThe Protocol Configuration Options (PCO) information element may be included in the request when the MS provides the GGSN with application specific parameters. The SGSN includes this IE in the Create PDP Context Request if the associated Activate PDP Context Request or Activate Secondary PDP Context Request from the MS includes protocol configuration options. The SGSN shall copy the content of this IE transparently from the content of the PCO IE in the Activate PDP Context Request message or Activate Secondary PDP Context Request.\nThe SGSN shall select one GGSN based on the user provided or SGSN selected APN. The GGSN may have a logical name that is converted to an address. The conversion may be performed with any name-to-address function. The converted address shall be stored in the \"GGSN Address in Use\" field in the PDP context and be used during the entire lifetime of the PDP context.\nIf the converted address includes an IPv6 address, the IPv4/IPv6 capable SGSN sends Create PDP Context Request to the GGSN including IPv6 addresses in the IEs SGSN Address for Control Plane and SGSN Address for user traffic. If the converted address only includes an IPv4 address, IPv4/IPv6 capable SGSN shall include IPv4 addresses in the IEs SGSN Address for Control Plane and SGSN Address for user traffic.\nNOTE 3:\tA DNS query may be used as the name-to-IP address mapping of the GGSN. The IP address returned in the DNS response is then stored in the \"GGSN Address in Use\" field in the PDP context.\nThe IMSI information element, or the IMEI information element if the MS is emergency attached and the MS is UICCless or the MS is emergency attached but the IMSI is not authenticated together with the NSAPI information element uniquely identifies the PDP context to be created.\nThe SGSN shall not send a Create PDP Context Request for an already active context.\nIf a new Create PDP Context Request is incoming on TEID 0 for an already active PDP context, this Create PDP Context Request must be considered related to a new session. The existing PDP context shall be torn down locally, and the associated PDP contexts deleted locally, before the new session is created. If a new Create PDP Context Request is incoming on a TEID which is different from 0 and this TEID is already allocated to one or more activated PDP contexts, and the NSAPI IE value in this message matches the NSAPI value of an active PDP context, the GGSN shall send back a Create PDP Context Response with a rejection cause code. It is implementation dependent deciding whether to teardown or keep the existing PDP context.\nIf the GGSN uses the MNRG flag and the flag is set, the GGSN should treat the Create PDP Context Request as a Note MS Present Request and clear the MNRG flag.\nThe SGSN shall determine Charging Characteristics from the Subscribed Charging Characteristics and/or PDP Context Charging Characteristics depending on the presence of the information in the Packet Domain Subscription Data as defined in 3GPP TS 23.060 [4]. The requirements for the presence of the Charging Characteristics IE are defined in 3GPP TS 23.060 [4]. The contents of the Charging Characteristics IE are defined in 3GPP TS 32.251 [18] and 3GPP TS 32.298 [34].\nThe SGSN shall include Trace Reference, Trace Type, Trigger Id, OMC Identity and Additional Trace Info (Trace reference2, Trace Recording Session Reference, triggering events in GGSN, Trace Depth, List of interfaces to trace in GGSN and Trace Activity Control) in the message if GGSN trace is activated. The SGSN shall copy Trace Reference, Trace Type, OMC Identity and Additional Trace Info from the trace request received from the HLR or OMC and the Trace Activity Control shall be set to Trace Activation\nFor more detailed description of Trace Session activation/deactivation procedures see 3GPP TS 32.422 [31]\nFor SGSN and GGSN trace record description see 3GPP TS 32.423 [32].\nThe SGSN shall include the Routeing Area Identity (RAI) where the MCC and MNC components shall be populated with the MCC and MNC of the serving core network operator of the MS. The LAC and RAC components shall be populated by the SGSN with the value of \"FFFE\" and \"FF\", respectively. See one exception to this rule below in shared GERAN and UTRAN networks.\nNOTE 4:\tThe serving core network operator ID is the PLMN ID of the SGSN which is currently serving the UE. An SGSN which supports multiple PLMN IDs is considered as logically different SGSNs.\nThe APN Restriction is an optional information element. In this instance, it is used by the SGSN to convey to the GGSN the highest restriction type out of all the currently active PDP Contexts for a particular subscriber.\nThe presence of the Common Flags IE is optional. If the NRSN bit of the Common Flags IE is set to 1, the SGSN supports the network requested bearer control. If NRSN bit of the Common Flags IE is set to 0 or the Common Flags IE is absent then the SGSN does not support network requested bearer control. If the Upgrade QoS Supported bit of the Common Flags IE is set to 1, the SGSN supports the QoS upgrade in Response message functionality. If Upgrade QoS Supported bit of the Common Flags IE is set to 0 or the Common Flags IE is absent then the SGSN does not support QoS upgrade in Response message functionality. The Dual Address Bearer Flag bit of the Common Flags IE shall be set to 1 if the PDP type, determined based on the MS request and subscription information, is set to IPv4v6 and all SGSNs, which the MS may be handed over to, are Release 9 or above supporting dual addressing, which is determined based on node pre‑configuration by the operator.\nThe SGSN may include the IMEI(SV) IE, CAMEL Charging Information Container IE and the User CSG Information IE if they are available (see clause 15.1.1a of 3GPP TS 23.060 [4] for more information). The SGSN shall include the User Location Information IE in the PDP Context Activation procedure. The SGSN shall include the CGI or SAI in the \"Geographic Location\" field of the User Location Information IE depending on whether the MS is in a cell or a service area respectively. The MS Time Zone IE shall be included in the Primary PDP Context Activation procedure, and may be included in the Secondary PDP Context Activation procedure. If the MS is emergency attached and the MS is UICCless or the IMSI is unauthenticated, the International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) shall be included and used as the MS identity. If the User CSG Information IE is included then the SGSN shall include the CSG ID, Access mode, the CSG Membership Indication shall also be included if the Access mode is Hybrid Mode.\nIn shared networks,\n-\twhen the message is sent from the VPLMN to the HPLMN, the PLMN ID that is communicated in the User Location Information IE, Routeing Area Identity (RAI) IE and User CSG Information IE shall be that of the selected Core Network Operator for supporting UEs, or that of the allocated Core Network Operator for non-supporting UEs. As an exception, based on inter-operator roaming/sharing agreement, if the information on whether the UE is a supporting or non-supporting UE is available, the PLMN ID that is communicated to the HPLMN for non-supporting UEs shall be the Common PLMN ID. See clause 4.4 of 3GPP TS 23.251 [35];\n-\twhen the SGSN and GGSN pertain to the same PLMN, the Common PLMN ID shall be communicated in SAI/CGI to the GGSN, for both supporting and non-supporting UEs. The Core Network Operator PLMN ID (selected by the UE for supporting UEs or allocated by the network for non-supporting UEs) shall be communicated in RAI and User CSG Information.\nThe SGSN shall include the RAT Type IE during Primary PDP Context Activation procedure.\nThe Correlation-ID shall be included if the PDP Context Activation is performed as part of the Network Requested Secondary PDP Context Activation Procedure.\nThe presence of the Extended Common Flags IE is optional. The Unauthenticated IMSI bit field shall be set to 1 if the IMSI present in the message is not authenticated and is for an emergency attached MS. The CSG Change Reporting Support Indication (CCRSI) bit field shall be set to 1 if the SGSN supports CSG Information Change Reporting and if the SGSN's operator policy permits reporting of User CSG Information change to the operator of the GGSN. If the CCRSI bit field is set to 0 or the Extended Common Flags IE is not included in the message, the GGSN shall assume that the SGSN originating the message does not support the CSG Information Change Reporting.\n3GPP TS 23.060 [4] (e.g. clause 9.2.2.1) defines the SGSN shall send the MS Info Change Reporting Support Indication to the GGSN. This specification however specifies that the SGSN shall send the CSG Change Reporting Support Indication for CSG Information Reporting even if stage 2 refers to MS Info Change Reporting Support Indication.\nThe SGSN shall include the Signalling Priority Indication IE during the PDP Context Activation procedure and the Secondary PDP Context Activation procedure if the UE indicates low access priority during these procedures.\nIn shared networks, the SGSN shall include the CN Operator Selection Entity IE during the Primary PDP Context Activation procedure to indicate whether the Serving Network has been selected by the UE or by the network.\nBased on operator policy, the SGSN shall include the Mapped UE Usage Type IE on the Gn interface, if available and if the SGSN supports the Dedicated Core Network feature. When present, it shall contain the mapped UE usage type applicable to the PDP Context.\nNOTE 5:\tThis information is used for the PGW-U selection (see Annex B.2 of 3GPP TS 29.244 [60]).\nBased on operator policy, the SGSN shall include the UP Function Selection Indication Flags, if any of the applicable flags is set to 1. The DCNR flag shall be set to 1 on the Gn/Gp interface if it is desired to select a PGW-U which supports NR, e.g. for UEs indicating support of dual connectivity with NR in NAS signalling to the SGSN and without subscription restriction to use NR as secondary RAT.\nNOTE 6:\tThis information is used for the PGW-U selection (see Annex B.2 of 3GPP TS 29.244 [60]).\nThe optional Private Extension contains vendor or operator specific information.\nTable 5: Information Elements in a Create PDP Context Request\nInformation element\nPresence requirement\nReference\nIMSI\nConditional\n7.7.2\nRouteing Area Identity (RAI)\nOptional\n7.7.3\nRecovery\nOptional\n7.7.11\nSelection mode\nConditional\n7.7.12\nTunnel Endpoint Identifier Data I\nMandatory\n7.7.13\nTunnel Endpoint Identifier Control Plane\nConditional\n7.7.14\nNSAPI\nMandatory\n7.7.17\nLinked NSAPI\nConditional\n7.7.17\nCharging Characteristics\nConditional\n7.7.23\nTrace Reference\nOptional\n7.7.24\nTrace Type\nOptional\n7.7.25\nEnd User Address\nConditional\n7.7.27\nAccess Point Name\nConditional\n7.7.30\nProtocol Configuration Options\nOptional\n7.7.31\nSGSN Address for signalling\nMandatory\nGSN Address 7.7.32\nSGSN Address for user traffic\nMandatory\nGSN Address 7.7.32\nMSISDN\nConditional\n7.7.33\nQuality of Service Profile\nMandatory\n7.7.34\nTFT\nConditional\n7.7.36\nTrigger Id\nOptional\n7.7.41\nOMC Identity\nOptional\n7.7.42\nCommon Flags\nOptional\n7.7.48\nAPN Restriction\nOptional\n7.7.49\nRAT Type\nOptional\n7.7.50\nUser Location Information\nOptional\n7.7.51\nMS Time Zone\nOptional\n7.7.52\nIMEI(SV)\nConditional\n7.7.53\nCAMEL Charging Information Container\nOptional\n7.7.54\nAdditional Trace Info\nOptional\n7.7.62\nCorrelation-ID\nOptional\n7.7.82\nEvolved Allocation/Retention Priority I\nOptional\n7.7.91\nExtended Common Flags\nOptional\n7.7.93\nUser CSG Information\nOptional\n7.7.94\nAPN-AMBR\nOptional\n7.7.98\nSignalling Priority Indication\nOptional\n7.7.103\nCN Operator Selection Entity\nOptional\n7.7.116\nMapped UE Usage Type\nOptional\n7.7.123\nUP Function Selection Indication Flags\nOptional\n7.7.124\nPrivate Extension\nOptional\n7.7.46",

      "content": "The message shall be sent from a GGSN node to a SGSN node as a response of a Create PDP Context Request. When the SGSN receives a Create PDP Context Response with the Cause value indicating the request is accepted, the SGSN activates the PDP context and may start to forward T-PDUs to/from the MS from/to the external data network.\nThe Cause value indicates if a PDP context has been created in the GGSN or not. A PDP context has not been created in the GGSN if the Cause differs from \"Request accepted\", \"New PDP type due to network preference\" or \"New PDP type due to single address bearer only\". Possible Cause values are:\n-\t\"Request Accepted\".\n-\t\"Context not found\"\n-\t\"No resources available\".\n-\t\"All dynamic PDP addresses are occupied\".\n-\t\"No memory is available\".\n-\t\"Missing or unknown APN\".\n-\t\"Unknown PDP address or PDP type\".\n-\t\"User authentication failed\".\n-\t\"System failure\".\n-\t\"Semantic error in the TFT operation\".\n-\t\"Syntactic error in the TFT operation\".\n-\t\"Semantic errors in packet filter(s)\".\n-\t\"Syntactic errors in packet filters(s)\".\n-\t\"Mandatory IE incorrect\".\n-\t\"Mandatory IE missing\".\n-\t\"Optional IE incorrect\".\n-\t\"Invalid message format\".\n-\t\"PDP context without TFT already activated\".\n-\t\"APN access denied – no subscription\".\n-\t\"APN Restriction type incompatibility with currently active PDP Contexts\"\n-\t\"Collision with network initiated request\".\n-\t\"New PDP type due to network preference\".\n-\t\"New PDP type due to single address bearer only\".\n-\t\"APN Congestion\".\n-\t\"Bearer handling not supported\".\n\"No resources available\" indicates that not enough resources are available within the network to allow the PDP Context to be created. \"Missing or unknown APN\" indicates e.g. when the GGSN does not support the Access Point Name. \"Unknown PDP address or PDP type\" indicates when the GGSN does not support the PDP type or the PDP address.\n\"APN Congestion\" indicates that the GGSN has detected congestion for the requested APN and performs overload control for that APN which does not allow the PDP Context to be created. When returning the cause \"APN Congestion\", the GGSN may include the GGSN Back-Off Time IE to indicate the time during which the SGSN should refrain from sending subsequent PDP Context requests to the GGSN for the congested APN for services other than emergency services. The last received value of the GGSN Back-Off Time IE shall supersede any previous values received from that GGSN and for this APN in the SGSN.\n\"User authentication failed\" indicates that the external packet network has rejected the service requested by the user e.g. the authentication check in the RADIUS server failed. \"PDP context without TFT already activated\" indicates that a PDP context has already been activated without a TFT for that MS. \"Context not found\" indicates that a Create PDP Request for a subsequent PDP context has been received, but the PDP context associated with the request, which the SGSN believes to be active does not exist on the GGSN. \"APN access denied – no subscription\" indicates that the GGSN has denied the user access to an APN because a subscription is required, but the subscriber does not have the necessary subscription.\nIf the Secondary PDP Context Activation Procedure is related to an established PDP context for LIPA or for SIPTO at the local network, the LGW shall reject the Create PDP Context request with the cause value of \"Bearer handling not supported\".\n\"New PDP type due to network preference\" indicates that the MS has requested PDP type IPv4v6 and only IPv4 or IPv6 address is allowed for the PDN based on GGSN operator policy, as specified in clause 9.2.1 in 3GPP TS 23.060 [4]. \"New PDP type due to single address bearer only\" indicates that the MS has requested PDP type IPv4v6 and both IPv4 and IPv6 addressing is possible in the PDN but the Dual Address Bearer Flag bit of the Common Flags IE is set to 0 or the Common Flags IE is absent, or only single IP version addressing is possible in the PDN, as specified in clause 9.2.1 in 3GPP TS 23.060 [4].\nOnly the Cause information element, optionally Protocol Configuration Options and optionally the Recovery information element shall be included in the response if the Cause contains another value than \"Request accepted\", \"New PDP type due to network preference\" or \"New PDP type due to single address bearer only\". The GGSN Back-Off Time IE may also be returned when rejecting a Create PDP Context Request with the cause \"APN Congestion\".\nThe Tunnel Endpoint Identifier for Data (I) field specifies an uplink Tunnel Endpoint Identifier for G-PDUs that is chosen by the GGSN. The SGSN shall include this Tunnel Endpoint Identifier in the GTP header of all subsequent uplink G-PDUs which are related to the requested PDP context.\nThe Tunnel Endpoint Identifier Control Plane field specifies an uplink Tunnel Endpoint Identifier for control plane messages, which is chosen by the GGSN. The SGSN shall include this Tunnel Endpoint Identifier in the GTP header of all subsequent uplink-control plane messages, which are related to the requested PDP context. If the GGSN has already confirmed successful assignment of its Tunnel Endpoint Identifier Control Plane to the peer SGSN, this field shall not be present. The GGSN confirms successful assignment of its Tunnel Endpoint Identifier Control Plane to the SGSN when it receives any message with its assigned Tunnel Endpoint Identifier Control Plane in the GTP header from the SGSN.\nThe GGSN may include the NSAPI received from the SGSN in the Create PDP Context Request message, in order to facilitate error handling in SGSN.\nNOTE 1:\tIf an SGSN receives a Create PDP Context Response with an NSAPI IE included for which there is no corresponding outstanding request, an SGSN may send a Delete PDP Context Request towards the GGSN that sent the Create PDP Context Response with the NSAPI included\nThe GGSN shall include a GGSN Address for control plane and a GGSN address for user traffic, which may differ from that provided by the underlying network service (e.g. IP).\nIf the Create PDP Context Request received from the SGSN included IPv6 SGSN address, an IPv4/IPv6 capable GGSN shall include IPv6 addresses in the fields GGSN Address for Control Plane and GGSN Address for user traffic, and IPv4 addresses in the fields Alternative GGSN Address for Control Plane and Alternative GGSN Address for user traffic. If SGSN included IPv4 SGSN addresses in the request, an IPv4/IPv6 capable GGSN shall include IPv4 addresses in the fields GGSN Address for Control Plane and GGSN Address for user traffic, and IPv6 addresses in the fields Alternative GGSN Address for Control Plane and Alternative GGSN Address for user traffic. An IPv4/IPv6 capable SGSN shall store these GGSN Addresses and use the addresses received in the fields GGSN Address for Control Plane and GGSN Address for user traffic when sending control plane signalling on this GTP tunnel or G-PDUs to the GGSN for the MS. An IPv4 only SGSN shall not store the IPv6 address included in the Alternative GGSN Address.\nNOTE 2:\tAn IPv4/IPv6 SGSN also stores the addresses received in the fields Alternative GGSN Address for Control Plane and Alternative GGSN Address for user traffic for inter-SGSN mobility scenarios. See clause 7.3.3.\nIf the MS requests a dynamic PDP address with the PDP Type IPv4, IPv6 or IPv4v6 and a dynamic PDP address is allowed, then the End User Address information element shall be included and the PDP Address field in the End User Address information element shall contain the dynamic PDP Address(es) allocated by the GGSN.\nNOTE 3:\tIf the GGSN uses DHCPv4 for IPv4 address allocation, then the GGSN sets the PDP Address field in the End User Address information element to \"0.0.0.0\", as specified in 3GPP TS 23.060 [4], clause 9.2.1.\nIf the MS requests a static PDP address with the PDP Type IPv4, IPv6 or IPv4v6, or a PDP address is specified with PDP Type PPP or Non-IP, then the End User Address information element shall be included and the PDP Address field shall not be included.\nThe PDP address in End User Address IE and in the Protocol configuration options IE shall be the same, if both IEs are present in the create PDP context response.  When using the Secondary PDP Context Activation Procedure, the End User Address element shall not be included in the message.\nThe QoS values supplied in the Create PDP Context Request may be negotiated downwards by the GGSN. If the SGSN has indicated support for upgrade of QoS in the request message, the QoS values may also be negotiated upwards by the GGSN. The negotiated values or the original values from SGSN are inserted in the Quality of Service Profile information element of the Create PDP Context Response message. The Evolved Allocation/Retention Priority I IE shall be included as the authorized Evolved Allocation/Retention Priority if the GGSN supports this IE and if the Evolved Allocation/Retention Priority I IE has been included in the corresponding request message. If there is no authorized Evolved ARP received from GGSN, SGSN shall continue to use legacy ARP included in the Quality of Service (QoS) Profile IE. The APN-AMBR IE shall be included as the authorized APN-AMBR if the GGSN supports this IE and if the APN-AMBR IE has been included in the corresponding request message.\nNOTE 4:\tThe value of the authorized APN-AMBR is included in the APN-AMBR IE, which has a different type than the APN-AMBR with NSAPI IE (see clauses 7.7.98 and 7.7.101).\nThe GGSN may start to forward T-PDUs after the Create PDP Context Response has been sent. The SGSN may start to forward T-PDUs when the Create PDP Context Response has been received. In this case the SGSN shall also be prepared to receive T-PDUs from the GGSN after it has sent a Create PDP Context Request but before a Create PDP Context Response has been received.\nThe Reordering Required value supplied in the Create PDP Context Response indicates whether the end user protocol benefits from packet in sequence delivery and whether the SGSN and the GGSN therefore shall perform reordering or not. In other words, if reordering is required by the GGSN, the SGSN and the GGSN shall perform reordering of incoming T-PDUs on this path. When the Quality of Service (QoS) Profile is Release 99 the receiving entity shall ignore the Reordering Required.\nThe GGSN shall include the Recovery information element into the Create PDP Context Response if the GGSN is in contact with the SGSN for the first time or the GGSN has restarted recently and the new Restart Counter value has not yet been indicated to the SGSN. The SGSN receiving the Recovery information element shall handle it as when an Echo Response message is received but shall consider the PDP context being created as active if the response indicates successful context activation at the GGSN.\nThe Charging ID is used to identify all charging records produced in SGSN(s) and the GGSN for this PDP context. The Charging ID is generated by the GGSN and shall be unique within the GGSN.\nThe Charging Gateway Address is the IP address of the recommended Charging Gateway Functionality to which the SGSN should transfer the Charging Detail Records (CDR) for this PDP Context.\nThe Alternative Charging Gateway Address IE has a similar purpose as the Charging Gateway Address but enables co-existence of IPv4 and IPv6 stacks in the Ga charging interfaces, without mandating any node to have a dual stack. The format of the optional Alternative Charging Gateway Address information element is the same as the format of the Charging Gateway Address.\nWhen both these addresses are present, the Charging Gateway address IE shall contain the IPv4 address of the Charging Gateway Function and the Alternative Charging Gateway address IE shall contain the IPv6 address of the Charging Gateway Function.\nNOTE 5:\tThe Charging Gateway Address and Alternative Charging Gateway Address both refer to the same Charging Gateway Function.\nThe APN Restriction is an optional information element.

      "content": "An Update PDP Context Request message shall be sent from an SGSN to a GGSN as part of the GPRS inter-SGSN Routeing Area Update procedure, the PDP Context Modification procedure, to redistribute contexts due to load sharing or as part of the inter-system intra‑SGSN update procedure i.e. UE transitioning between UTRAN and GERAN A/Gb mode (and vice versa) on the same SGSN and if the SGSN decides to enable a direct GTP-U tunnel between the GGSN and the RNC. It shall be used to change the QoS and the path. For the inter-SGSN Routeing Area Update procedure the message shall be sent by the new SGSN.\nThe Update PDP Context Request shall also be used as part of:\n-\tthe Secondary PDP Context Activation Procedure to indicate that RAN Procedures are ready and that the SGSN is ready to receive payload from the GGSN on the new PDP Context;\n-\tthe UTRAN/GERAN to UTRAN (HSPA) SRVCC Procedure when the target node is a Gn/Gp SGSN as specified in 3GPP TS 23.216 [50]; or\n-\tthe HSS-based P-CSCF restoration procedure as specified in 3GPP TS 23.380 [57].\nThe NSAPI information element together with the Tunnel Endpoint Identifier in the GTP header unambiguously identifies a PDP Context in the GGSN.\nThe IMSI, if available, should be included and the GGSN should use the IMSI to verify if the Update PDP Context Request message is received for the right UE context.\nNOTE 1:\tIn some error scenarios, e.g. a delete PDP context request is lost over Gn/Gp interface, the hanging PDP Context in the SGSN can trigger an update towards the GGSN, if the GGSN has reassigned the F-TEID of the hanging PDP Context for another UE.\nThe Tunnel Endpoint Identifier Data field specifies a downlink Tunnel Endpoint Identifier for G-PDUs which is chosen by the SGSN. The GGSN shall include this Tunnel Endpoint Identifier in the GTP header of all subsequent downlink G-PDUs that are related to the requested PDP context.\nThe Tunnel Endpoint Identifier Control Plane field specifies a downlink Tunnel Endpoint Identifier Control Plane messages which is chosen by the SGSN. The GGSN shall include this Tunnel Endpoint Identifier in the GTP header of all subsequent downlink control plane messages that are related to the requested PDP context.  If the SGSN has already confirmed successful assignment of its Tunnel Endpoint Identifier Control Plane to the peer GGSN, this field shall not be present. The SGSN confirms successful assignment of its Tunnel Endpoint Identifier Control Plane to the GGSN when it receives any message with its assigned Tunnel Endpoint Identifier Control Plane in the GTP header from the GGSN.\nThe Quality of Service Profile information element shall include the QoS negotiated between the MS and SGSN at PDP Context activation or the new QoS negotiated in the PDP Context Modification procedure. The Evolved Allocation/Retention Priority I information element shall include the negotiated Evolved Allocation/Retention Priority if the SGSN supports it and if the support of Evolved ARP has been indicated by the current GGSN or if the SGSN has no information if GGSN supports Evolved ARP. If the SGSN has ever indicated the support of the eARP IE towards a GGSN, it then shall include it in all subsequent GTP messages (i.e. Create PDP Context Request and Update PDP Context Request) towards the same GGSN for a given PDN connection, assuming the eARP remains valid within the subscription and that GGSN supports eARP. The APN-AMBR shall include the negotiated APN-AMBR if the SGSN supports it and if the support of APN-AMBR has been indicated by the current GGSN and the current SGSN changes the APN-AMBR or if the SGSN has no information if GGSN supports APN-AMBR.\nThe SGSN shall include an SGSN Address for control plane and an SGSN address for user traffic, which may differ from that provided by the underlying network service (e.g. IP).\nThe following requirements apply for IPv4/IPv6 capable SGSN and GGSN:\n-\tFor an Update PDP Context request triggered by an inter-SGSN mobility scenario, if an IPv4/IPv6 capable SGSN did not receive IPv6 addresses for both the GGSN control plane and GGSN user plane from the old SGSN, it shall include IPv4 addresses in the fields SGSN Address for Control Plane and SGSN Address for User Traffic and IPv6 addresses in the fields Alternative SGSN Address for Control Plane and Alternative SGSN Address for User Traffic. Otherwise, an IPv4/IPv6 capable SGSN shall use only SGSN IPv6 addresses if it has GGSN IPv6 addresses available for both the GGSN control plane and GGSN user plane.\n-\tFor an Update PDP Context Request triggered by an intra-SGSN scenario, an IPv4/IPv6 capable SGSN should only include SGSN addresses of the same type as the address type currently in use between the SGSN and GGSN for the PDP context, i.e. of the same type as the GGSN Address for Control Plane and GGSN Address for user traffic earlier received from the GGSN. For instance, if IPv4 is currently in use between the SGSN and GGSN, the SGSN should include SGSN IPv4 addresses and it should not include Alternative SGSN Addresses for Control Plane or User Traffic.\n-\tIn either case, if IPv6 SGSN addresses are included in the request and the GGSN supports IPv6 below GTP, the GGSN shall store and use the IPv6 SGSN addresses for communication with the SGSN and ignore the IPv4 SGSN addresses. If IPv6 SGSN addresses are included in the request and the GGSN supports only IPv4 below GTP, the GGSN shall store and use the IPv4 SGSN addresses for communication with the SGSN and ignore the IPv6 SGSN addresses. When active contexts are being redistributed due to load sharing, G-PDUs that are in transit across the Gn-interface are in an undetermined state and may be lost.\nThe SGSN shall include a Recovery information element into the Update PDP Context Request if the SGSN is in contact with the GGSN for the very first time or if the SGSN has restarted recently and the new Restart Counter value has not yet been indicated to the GGSN. The GGSN that receives a Recovery information element in the Update PDP Context Request message element shall handle it in the same way as when receiving an Echo Response message. The Update PDP Context Request message shall be considered as a valid update request for the PDP context indicated in the message.\nThe Traffic Flow Template (TFT) is used to distinguish between different user traffic flows.\nThe SGSN shall include Trace Reference, Trace Type, Trigger Id, OMC Identity and Additional Trace Info (Trace reference 2, Trace Recording Session Reference, triggering events in GGSN, Trace Depth, List of interfaces to trace in GGSN and Trace Activity Control) in the message if GGSN trace is activated while the PDP context is active. The SGSN shall copy Trace Reference, Trace Type, OMC Identity and Additional Trace Info from the trace request received from the HLR or OMC and the Trace Activity Control of the Additional Trace Info shall be set to Trace Activation\nIf SGSN deactivates the Trace Session to GGSN, the SGSN shall include the Additional Trace Info in the message and the Trace Activity Control shall be set to Trace Deactivation.\nFor more detailed description of Trace Session activation/deactivation procedures see 3GPP TS 32.422 [31]\nFor SGSN and GGSN trace record description see 3GPP TS 32.423 [32]\nThe SGSN shall include the Routeing Area Identity (RAI) if the serving core network operator has changed, or the SGSN may include it otherwise. The MCC and MNC components shall be populated with the MCC and MNC of the serving core network operator. The LAC and RAC components shall be populated by the SGSN with the value of \"FFFE\" and \"FF\", respectively. See one exception to this rule below in shared GERAN and UTRAN networks.\nNOTE 2:\tThe serving core network operator ID is the PLMN ID of the SGSN which is currently serving the UE. An SGSN which supports multiple PLMN IDs is considered as logically different SGSNs.\nThe optional Private Extension contains vendor or operator specific information.\nThe MS includes the Protocol Configuration Options (PCO) information element in the request if the MS wishes to provide the GGSN with application specific parameters. The SGSN includes this IE in the Update PDP Context Request if the associated Modify PDP Context Request from the MS includes protocol configuration options. The SGSN shall copy the content of this IE transparently from the content of the PCO IE in the Modify PDP Context Request message.\nThe presence of the Common Flags IE is optional. If the RAN Procedures Ready bit of the Common Flags IE is set to 1, then SGSN is ready to receive payload on the PDP Context indicated in the message. If RAN Procedures Ready bit of the Common Flags IE is set to 0 or the Common Flags IE is absent then the RAN procedures in the SGSN may or may not be ready. If the NRSN bit of the Common Flags IE is set to 1, the SGSN supports the network requested bearer control. If NRSN bit of the Common Flags IE is set to 0 or the Common Flags IE is absent then the SGSN does not support network requested bearer control. Handling of the Common Flags IE (also the handling of \"No QoS negotiation\" bit in the Common Flags IE) by GGSN is specified in clause 7.3.4 \"Update PDP Context Response\". If the Upgrade QoS Supported bit of the Common Flags IE is set to 1, the SGSN supports the QoS upgrade in Response message functionality. If Upgrade QoS Supported bit of the Common Flags IE is set to 0 or the Common Flags IE is absent then the SGSN does not support QoS upgrade in Response message functionality.\nIf the Direct Tunnel Flags IE is included and if the DTI bit of the Direct Tunnel Flags IE is set to 1, this indicates to the GGSN that for this PDP Context the SGSN is invoking a direct tunnel. In this case, the GGSN shall not change the allocated userplane Tunnel Endpoint Identifier Data and IP address in the corresponding Update PDP Context Response message. If the DTI bit of the Direct Tunnel Flags IE is set to 0 or the Direct Tunnel Flags IE is absent, this indicates to the GGSN that for this PDP Context the SGSN is not invoking a direct tunnel. All other fields of the Direct Tunnel Flags IE shall be ignored.\nThe SGSN may include the MS Time Zone IE if it is available (see clause 15.1.1a of 3GPP TS 23.060 [4] for more information). The SGSN shall include the User Location Information IE in the PDP Context Modification procedure and, if the SGSN has deferred the reporting of a previous ULI change until a RAB or user plane is established (see clause 7.5B.1.1), in a Service Request procedure when establishing a direct GTP-U tunnel between the GGSN and the RNC. The SGSN may include the User Location Information IE in the other procedures. If the User Location Information IE is included then the SGSN shall include the CGI or SAI in the \"Geographic Location\" field depending on whether the MS is in a cell or a service area respectively. If the SGSN supports CSG Information Change Reporting and if CSG Change Reporting is requested by the GGSN via the CSG Information Reporting Action, the SGSN shall include the User CSG Information IE if the UE is accessed via CSG cell or Hybrid cell. If the User CSG Information IE is included then the SGSN shall include the CSG ID, Access mode, the CSG Membership Indication shall also be included if the Access mode is Hybrid Mode. If the User CSG Information IE is not received, the GGSN shall consider that the UE has left CSG cell or the hybrid cell.\nIn shared networks,\n-\twhen the message is sent from the VPLMN to the HPLMN, the PLMN ID that is communicated in the User Location Information IE, Routeing Area Identity (RAI) IE and User CSG Information IE shall be that of the selected Core Network Operator for supporting UEs, or that of the allocated Core Network Operator for non-supporting UEs. As an exception, based on inter-operator roaming/sharing agreement, if the information on whether the UE is a supporting or non-supporting UE is available, the PLMN ID that is communicated to the HPLMN for non-supporting UEs shall be the Common PLMN ID. See clause 4.4 of 3GPP TS 23.251 [35];\n-\twhen the SGSN and GGSN pertain to the same PLMN, the Common PLMN ID shall be communicated in SAI/CGI to the GGSN, for both supporting and non-supporting UEs. The Core Network Operator PLMN ID (selected by the UE for supporting UEs or allocated by the network for non-supporting UEs) shall be communicated in RAI and User CSG Information.\nThe SGSN shall include the RAT Type IE if the RAT Type has changed or the SGSN may include it otherwise (see clause 15.1.1a of 3GPP TS 23.060 [4] for more information).\nThe presence of the Extended Common Flags IE is optional. The CSG Change Reporting Support Indication (CCRSI) bit field shall be set to 1 if the SGSN supports CSG Information Change Reporting and if the SGSN's operator policy permits reporting of User CSG Information change to the operator of the GGSN. If the CCRSI bit field is set to 0 or the Extended Common Flags IE is not included in the message, the GGSN shall assume that the SGSN originating the message does not support the CSG Information Change Reporting. 3GPP TS 23.060 [4] (e.g. clause 9.2.2.1) defines the SGSN shall send the MS Info Change Reporting Support Indication to the GGSN. In such case SGSN shall use the CSG Change Reporting Support Indication for CSG Information Reporting even if stage 2 refers to MS Info Change Reporting Support Indication. The CS to PS SRVCC indication (CPSR) bit field shall be set to 1 if UTRAN/GERAN to UTRAN (HSPA) SRVCC Procedure is underway as specified in 3GPP TS 23.216 [50].\nThe SGSN shall include the Extended Common Flags IE and set the PCRI (P-CSCF Restoration Indication) bit field to 1, for the IMS PDN connection, if the SGSN has received the indication from the HSS that a P-CSCF restoration is required for this user, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.380 [57]. If the PDN connection is \"Delay Tolerant\" and if there is pending network initiated PDN connection signalling, the SGSN shall set the UASI (UE Available for Signalling Indication) bit field during a RAU, a Service Request procedure for UTRAN, or at receipt of an uplink LLC PDU for user data or any valid LLC frame serving as a paging response for GERAN.\nThe SGSN shall include the Signalling Priority Indication IE during a PDP Context Modification procedure if the UE indicates low access priority during that procedure.\nIn shared networks, the SGSN shall include the CN Operator Selection Entity IE during the Routeing Area Update procedure, if the information is available, to indicate whether the Serving Network has been selected by the UE or by the network.\nThe IMEI(SV) should be included if the IMSI is not available and the GGSN should use the IMEI(SV) to verify if the Update PDP Context Request message is received for the right UE context.\nTable 7: Information Elements in an SGSN-Initiated Update PDP Context Request\nInformation element\nPresence requirement\nReference\nIMSI\nOptional\n7.7.2\nRouteing Area Identity (RAI)\nOptional\n7.7.3\nRecovery\nOptional\n7.7.11\nTunnel Endpoint Identifier Data I\nMandatory\n7.7.13\nTunnel Endpoint Identifier Control Plane\nConditional\n7.7.14\nNSAPI\nMandatory\n7.7.17\nTrace Reference\nOptional\n7.7.24\nTrace Type\nOptional\n7.7.25\nProtocol Configuration Options\nOptional\n7.7.31\nSGSN Address for Control Plane\nMandatory\nGSN Address 7.7.32\nSGSN Address for User Traffic\nMandatory\nGSN Address 7.7.32\nAlternative SGSN Address for Control Plane\nConditional\nGSN Address 7.7.32\nAlternative SGSN Address for User Traffic\nConditional\nGSN Address 7.7.32\nQuality of Service Profile\nMandatory\n7.7.34\nTFT\nOptional\n7.7.36\nTrigger Id\nOptional\n7.7.41\nOMC Identity\nOptional\n7.7.42\nCommon Flags\nOptional\n7.7.48\nRAT Type\nOptional\n7.7.50\nUser Location Information\nOptional\n7.7.51\nMS Time Zone\nOptional\n7.7.52\nAdditonal Trace Info\nOptional\n7.7.62\nDirect Tunnel Flags\nOptional\n7.7.81\nEvolved Allocation/Retention Priority I\nOptional\n7.7.91\nExtended Common Flags\nOptional\n7.7.93\nUser CSG Information\nOptional\n7.7.94\nAPN-AMBR\nOptional\n7.7.98\nSignalling Priority Indication\nOptional\n7.7.103\nCN Operator Selection Entity\nOptional\n7.7.116\nIMEI(SV)\nOptional\n7.7.53\nPrivate Extension\nOptional\n7.7.46\nAn Update PDP Context Request may also be sent from a GGSN to an SGSN:\n-\tto re-negotiate the QoS of a PDP context;\n-\tto provide a PDP address to the SGSN (and MS);\n-\tto request the User Location Information IE from the SGSN. The latter shall be used by GGSN when it acts as a DHCP Relay Agent or Mobile IP Foreign Agent;\n-\tto request the start/stop of MS Info Change Reporting and/or CSG Info Change Reporting;\n-\tto check that the PDP context is still active at the SGSN. In such a case, the GGSN shall include the optional IMSI IE, to add robustness against the case the SGSN has re-assigned the TEID to another PDP context (this may happen when the PDP context is dangling at the GGSN). Also, the \"Quality of service profile\" IE and the \"End user Address\" IE shall not be included in this case;\n-\tfor network requested bearer control, to add, modify or delete the TFT related to the PDP Context or to change the Bearer Control Mode;\n-\twhen a direct tunnel is used and the GGSN receives an Error Indication message from the RNC. In such a case, the GGSN shall include the NSAPI IE and the Direct Tunnel Flags IE with the EI bit set; orNOTE 2:\tSGSN and GGSN behaviour for RNC failure and recovery is defined in 3GPP TS 23.007 [3].\n-\tas part of the P-CSCF restoration procedure (see 3GPP TS 23.380 [57]).\nThe Quality of Service Profile information element shall include the GGSN requested QoS. The Evolved Allocation/Retention Priority I IE shall be included if Evolved Allocation/Retention Priority has been newly authorized and if the GGSN supports this IE and if the support of Evolved ARP has been indicated by the current SGSN. The APN-AMBR IE shall be included if APN-AMBR has been newly authorized and if the GGSN supports this IE and if the support of APN-AMBR has been indicated by the current SGSN.\nThe End User Address information element shall contain a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address.\nThe GGSN shall include a Recovery information element into the Update PDP Context Request if the GGSN has restarted recently and the new Restart Counter value has not yet been indicated to the SGSN. The SGSN that receives a Recovery information element in the Update PDP Context Request message element shall handle it in the same way as when receiving an Echo Response message. The Update PDP Context Request message shall be considered as a valid update request for the PDP context indicated in the message.\nThe NSAPI information element together with the Tunnel Endpoint Identifier in the GTP header unambiguously identifies a PDP Context in the SGSN.\nThe GGSN includes the Protocol Configuration Options (PCO) information element in the request if the GGSN wishes to provide the MS with application specific parameters or to indicate the Bearer Control Mode to the MS. The SGSN includes this IE in the Modify PDP Context Request message if the associated Update PDP Context Request message from the GGSN includes protocol configuration options. The SGSN shall copy the content of this IE transparently from the content of the PCO IE in the Update PDP Context Request message.\nThe optional Private Extension contains vendor or operator specific information.\nThe TFT is optional and included in order to add, modify or delete the TFT related to the PDP Context for network requested bearer control.\nIf Bearer Control Mode is provided by the GGSN in the PCO, the Bearer Control Mode IE shall be included in order to inform the SGSN about the bearer control mode and shall indicate the same bearer control mode as indicated to the MS in the PCO.\nThe presence of the Common Flags IE is optional. If the Prohibit Payload Compression bit of the Common Flags IE is set to 1, then for A/Gb mode access the SGSN shall not compress the payload of user data regardless of whether the user asks for payload compression. If the Prohibit Payload Compression bit of the Common Flags IE is set to 0 or the Common Flags IE is absent then the SGSN shall perform payload compression when the user asks for it as per normal operation.\nThe APN Restriction is an optional information element. In this instance it is used by the GGSN to convey to the SGSN the restriction type of the associated PDP Context being updated.\nIf the SGSN has indicated the support for MS Info Change Reporting and if the MS Info Change Reporting mechanism is to be started or stopped for this subscriber, then the GGSN shall include the MS Info Change Reporting Action IE in the message and shall set the value of the Action field appropriately.\nIf the SGSN has indicated the support for CSG Information Change Reporting and if the CSG Information Reporting mechanism is to be started or stopped for this PDN connection, then the GGSN shall include the CSG Information Reporting Action IE in the message and shall set the value of the Action field appropriately.\nThe GGSN shall include the Extended Common Flags IE and set the RetLoc (Retrieve Location) bit field to 1 if it requests the SGSN to provide the user's location information, e.g. upon receipt of such a request from the PCRF.

      "content": "The message shall be sent from a GGSN node to a SGSN node as a response of an Update PDP Context Request.\nIf the SGSN receives an Update PDP Context Response with a Cause value other than \"Request accepted\", it shall abort the update of the PDP context.\nIf the SGSN receives an Update PDP Context Response with a Cause value \"Non-existent\", it shall delete the PDP Context.\nOnly the Cause information element, optionally Protocol Configuration Options and optionally the Recovery information element shall be included in the response if the Cause contains another value than \"Request accepted\".\nPossible Cause values are:\n-\t\"Request Accepted\".\n-\t\"Non-existent\".\n-\t\"Service not supported\".\n-\t\"System failure\".\n-\t\"Semantic error in the TFT operation\".\n-\t\"Syntactic error in the TFT operation\".\n-\t\"Semantic errors in packet filter(s)\".\n-\t\"Syntactic errors in packet filters(s)\".\n-\t\"Mandatory IE incorrect\".\n-\t\"Mandatory IE missing\".\n-\t\"Optional IE incorrect\".\n-\t\"Invalid message format\".\n-\t\"Bearer Control Mode violation\".\n-\t\"Bearer handling not supported\".\n-\t\"UE is temporarily not reachable due to power saving\".\nIf the update PDP context request is related to an established PDP context for LIPA or for SIPTO at the local network, the LGW shall reject the update PDP context request with the cause value of \"Bearer handling not supported\".\nThe Tunnel Endpoint Identifier Data field specifies an uplink Tunnel Endpoint Identifier for G-PDUs that is chosen by the GGSN. The SGSN shall include this Tunnel Endpoint Identifier in the GTP header of all subsequent uplink G-PDUs that are related to the requested PDP context. This information element shall be included if the Cause contains the value \"Request accepted\" and may contain a new Tunnel Endpoint Identifier Data only if DTI bit of the Direct Tunnel Flags IE is set to 0 or the Direct Tunnel Flags IE is absent in the corresponding Update PDP Context Request.\nThe Tunnel Endpoint Identifier Control Plane field specifies an uplink Tunnel Endpoint Identifier Control Plane messages which is chosen by the GGSN. The SGSN shall include this Tunnel Endpoint Identifier in the GTP header of all subsequent uplink control plane messages which are related to the requested PDP context.  If the GGSN has already confirmed successful assignment of its Tunnel Endpoint Identifier Control Plane to the peer SGSN, this field shall not be present. The GGSN confirms successful assignment of its Tunnel Endpoint Identifier Control Plane to the SGSN when it receives any message with its assigned Tunnel Endpoint Identifier Control Plane in the GTP header from the SGSN.\nThe QoS values supplied in the Update PDP Context Request may be negotiated downwards by the GGSN. If the SGSN has indicated support for upgrade of QoS in the request message, the QoS values may also be negotiated upwards by the GGSN. In case the \"No QoS negotiation\" flag has been set to 1 by the SGSN in the corresponding request, the QoS values shall not be renegotiated, neither upwards, nor downwards (see also PCO handling below). The negotiated values or the original value from SGSN is inserted in the Quality of Service Profile information element. This information element shall be included if the Cause contains the value \"Request accepted\". The Evolved Allocation/Retention Priority I IE shall be included if Evolved Allocation/Retention Priority has been newly authorized and if the GGSN supports this IE and if the Evolved ARP has been included in the corresponding request message. If there is no authorized Evolved ARP received from GGSN, SGSN shall continue to use legacy ARP included in the Quality of Service (QoS) Profile IE. The APN-AMBR IE shall be included if APN-AMBR has been newly authorized and if the GGSN supports this IE and if the APN-AMBR has been included in the corresponding request message.\nThe GGSN may start to forward T-PDUs after the Update PDP Context Response has been sent. The SGSN may start to forward T-PDUs when the Update PDP Context Response has been received. In this case the SGSN shall also be prepared to receive T-PDUs from the GGSN after it has sent an Update PDP Context Request but before an Update PDP Context Response has been received.\nThe GGSN shall include a GGSN address for user traffic, which may differ from that provided by the underlying network service (e.g. IP). If DTI bit of the Direct Tunnel Flags IE is set to 0 or the Direct Tunnel Flags IE is absent in the corresponding Update PDP Context Request, and the GGSN needs to change the IP Address, the GGSN shall include the new IP address. Otherwise, the GGSN shall include the currently used IP address. An IPv4/IPv6 capable GGSN shall include both its IP version addresses. If the Update PDP Context Request received from the SGSN included IPv6 SGSN addresses, an IPv4/IPv6 capable GGSN shall include an IPv6 address in the field GGSN Address for User Traffic and a corresponding IPv4 address in the field Alternative GGSN Address for User Traffic. If SGSN included only an IPv4 SGSN address in the request, IPv4/IPv6 capable GGSN shall include IPv4 address for user traffic in the field GGSN Address for User Traffic and IPv6 address in the field Alternative GGSN Address for User Traffic. An IPv4/IPv6 capable SGSN shall store the GGSN Addresses and use the address received in the field GGSN Address for user traffic when sending G-PDUs to the GGSN for the MS. An IPv4 only SGSN shall not store the IPv6 address included in the Alternative GGSN Address. When active contexts are being redistributed due to load sharing, G‑PDUs that are in transit across the Gn-interface are in an undetermined state and may be lost.\nThe GGSN shall also include a GGSN address for control plane, which shall not differ from that provided at PDP context setup time and shall remain unchanged for the lifetime of the PDP context. If the Update PDP Context Request received from the SGSN included IPv6 SGSN addresses, an IPv4/IPv6 capable GGSN shall include an IPv6 address in the field GGSN Address for Control Plane and a corresponding IPv4 address in the field Alternative GGSN Address for Control Plane. If SGSN included only an IPv4 SGSN address in the request, IPv4/IPv6 capable GGSN shall include IPv4 address for Control plane in the field GGSN Address for Control Plane and IPv6 address for Control plane in the field Alternative GGSN Address for Control Plane. An IPv4/IPv6 capable SGSN shall use the address received in the field GGSN Address for Control Plane when sending control plane signalling on this GTP tunnel to the GGSN for the MS.\nThe GGSN Address for control plane and the GGSN Address for user traffic shall be included if the Cause contains the value \"Request accepted\". The Alternative GGSN Addresses shall be included if the GGSN supports IPv6 below GTP and the Cause contains the value \"Request accepted\".\nThe GGSN shall include the Recovery information element into the Update PDP Context Response if the GGSN is in contact with the SGSN for the first time or if the GGSN has restarted recently and the new Restart Counter value has not yet been indicated to the SGSN. The SGSN receiving the Recovery information element shall handle it as when an Echo Response message is received but shall consider the PDP context as updated and active if the response cause indicates a successful operation at the GGSN.\nThe Charging ID is used to identify all charging records produced in SGSN(s) and the GGSN for this PDP context. The Charging ID has been previously generated by the GGSN and is unique for this PDP context. If an inter-SGSN routing area update occurs, it is transferred to the new SGSN as part of each active PDP context. This information element shall be included if the Cause contains the value \"Request accepted\".\nThe Charging Gateway Address is the IP address of the recommended Charging Gateway Functionality to which the SGSN should transfer the Charging Detail Records (CDR) for this PDP Context.\nThe Alternative Charging Gateway Address  IE has a similar purpose as the Charging Gateway Address but enables co-existence of IPv4 and IPv6 stacks in the Ga charging interfaces, without mandating any node to have a dual stack. The format of the optional Alternative Charging Gateway Address information element is the same as the format of the Charging Gateway Address.\nWhen both these addresses are present, the Charging Gateway address IE shall contain the IPv4 address of the Charging Gateway Function and the Alternative Charging Gateway address IE shall contain the IPv6 address of the Charging Gateway Function.\nNOTE 1:\tThe Charging Gateway Address and Alternative Charging Gateway Address both refer to the same Charging Gateway Function.\nThe optional Private Extension contains vendor or operator specific information.\nThe GGSN may include the Protocol Configuration Options (PCO) information element in the response if the GGSN wishes to provide the MS with application specific parameters or to indicate the Bearer Control Mode to the MS.\nIf the \"No QoS negotiation\" bit of the Common Flags IE in the Update PDP Context Request message was set to 1, then the GGSN shall not re-negotiate QoS in the corresponding Update PDP Context Response and shall not include the Protocol Configuration Options (PCO) information element in the message). If the \"No QoS negotiation\" bit of the Common Flags IE was set to 0 or the Common Flags IE was absent from the Update PDP Context Request message (e.g. message was sent by pre Rel-7 SGSN), then:\n-\tthe GGSN may re-negotiate QoS in the corresponding Update PDP Context Response;\n-\tthe GGSN may include a PCO in the Update PDP Context Response message, but the PCO shall contain at least the same information as the PCO IE, which was sent earlier (see e.g. clause 9.2.2 \"Activation Procedures\" in 3GPP TS 23.060 [4]).\nThe presence of the Common Flags IE is optional. If the Prohibit Payload Compression bit of the Common Flags IE is set to 1, then for A/Gb mode access the SGSN shall not compress the payload of user data regardless of whether the user asks for payload compression. If the Prohibit Payload Compression bit of the Common Flags IE is set to 0 or the Common Flags IE is absent then the SGSN shall perform payload compression when the user asks for it as per normal operation.\nThe APN Restriction is an optional information element. In this instance it is used by the GGSN to convey to the SGSN the restriction type of the associated PDP Context being updated.\nIf Bearer Control Mode is provided by the GGSN in the PCO, the Bearer Control Mode IE shall be included in order to inform the SGSN about the bearer control mode and shall indicate the same bearer control mode as indicated to the MS in the PCO.\nIf the SGSN has indicated the support for MS Info Change Reporting and if the MS Info Change Reporting mechanism is to be started or stopped for this PDN connection in the SGSN, then the GGSN shall include the MS Info Change Reporting Action IE in the message and shall set the value of Action field appropriately.\nIf the SGSN has indicated the support for CSG Information Change Reporting and if the CSG Information Reporting mechanism is to be started or stopped for this subscriber, then the GGSN shall include the CSG Information Reporting Action IE in the message and shall set the value of the Action field appropriately.\nTable 9: Information Elements in an Update PDP Context Response sent by a GGSN\nInformation element\nPresence requirement\nReference\nCause\nMandatory\n7.7.1\nRecovery\nOptional\n7.7.11\nTunnel Endpoint Identifier Data I\nConditional\n7.7.13\nTunnel Endpoint Identifier Control Plane\nConditional\n7.7.14\nCharging ID\nConditional\n7.7.26\nProtocol Configuration Options\nOptional\n7.7.31\nGGSN Address for Control Plane\nConditional\nGSN Address 7.7.32\nGGSN Address for User Traffic\nConditional\nGSN Address 7.7.32\nAlternative GGSN Address for Control Plane\nConditional\nGSN Address 7.7.32\nAlternative GGSN Address for User Traffic\nConditional\nGSN Address 7.7.32\nQuality of Service Profile\nConditional\n7.7.34\nCharging Gateway Address\nOptional\n7.7.44\nAlternative Charging Gateway Address\nOptional\n7.7.44\nCommon Flags\nOptional\n7.7.48\nAPN Restriction\nOptional\n7.7.49\nBearer Control Mode\nOptional\n7.7.83\nMS Info Change Reporting Action\nOptional\n7.7.80\nEvolved Allocation/Retention Priority I\nOptional\n7.7.91\nCSG Information Reporting Action\nOptional\n7.7.95\nAPN-AMBR\nOptional\n7.7.98\nPrivate Extension\nOptional\n7.7.46\nThe message can also be sent from a SGSN node to a GGSN node as a response of a GGSN-initiated Update PDP Context Request.\nIf the GGSN receives an Update PDP Context Response with a Cause value other than \"Request accepted\", it shall abort the update of the PDP context if the associated Update PDP Context Request was sent only to re-negotiate the QoS of a PDP context. Furthermore if the associated Update PDP Context Request included an \"End User Address\" information element the GGSN shall delete the PDP context using the Delete PDP Context procedure and may notify the Operation and Maintenance network element.\nOnly the Cause information element, optionally Protocol Configuration Options and optionally the Recovery information element shall be included in the response if the Cause contains another value than \"Request accepted\".\nPossible Cause values are the same as for the Update PDP Context Response sent by a GGSN except the cause code \"UE is temporarily not reachable due to power saving\" shall only be included by a SGSN. When the optional IMSI IE value differs from the IMSI IE value associated to the PDP context, the SGSN shall respond using the cause value \"Non-existent\".\nThe SGSN includes the Protocol Configuration Options (PCO) information element in the response if the MS wishes to provide the GGSN with application specific parameters. The SGSN includes this IE in the Update PDP Context Response message if the associated Modify PDP Context Accept message from the MS includes protocol configuration options. The SGSN shall copy the content of this IE transparently from the content of the PCO IE in the Modify PDP Context Accept message.\nThe QoS values supplied in the Update PDP Context Request may be negotiated downwards by the SGSN. The negotiated values or the original value from GGSN is inserted in the Quality of Service Profile information element. This information element shall be included if the Cause contains the value \"Request accepted\" and a QoS information element was supplied in the corresponding request message. The Evolved Allocation/Retention Priority I information element shall include the negotiated Evolved Allocation/Retention Priority if the SGSN supports this IE and if an Evolved Allocation/Retention Priority I information element was supplied in the corresponding request message. The APN-AMBR IE shall be included if the SGSN supports this IE and if the APN-AMBR has been included in the corresponding request message.\nThe SGSN shall include the Recovery information element into the Update PDP Context Response if the SGSN has restarted recently and the new Restart Counter value has not yet been indicated to the GGSN. The GGSN receiving the Recovery information element shall handle it as when an Echo Response message is received but shall consider the PDP context as updated and active if the response cause indicates a successful operation at the SGSN.\nIf the SGSN sends Update PDP Context Response message in order to re-establish the user plane tunnel between SGSN and GGSN, then the SGSN includes only the Cause IE, the SGSN Address for User Traffic IE and Tunnel Endpoint Identifier Data IE. The GGSN shall include Tunnel Endpoint Identifier Data in the GTP header of all subsequent downlink G-PDUs which are related to the requested PDP Context.\nIn the MS to GGSN direction, the SGSN shall include the User Location Information IE, and may include the MS Time Zone information element. The SGSN shall include the CGI or SAI in the \"Geographic Location\" field of the User Location Information IE depending on whether the MS is in a cell or a service area respectively.\nIn shared networks,\n-\twhen the message is sent from the VPLMN to the HPLMN, the PLMN ID that is communicated in the User Location Information IE shall be that of the selected Core Network Operator for supporting UEs, or that of the allocated Core Network Operator for non-supporting UEs. As an exception, based on inter-operator roaming/sharing agreement, if the information on whether the UE is a supporting or non-supporting UE is available, the PLMN ID that is communicated to the HPLMN for non-supported UEs shall be the Common PLMN ID. See clause 4.4 of 3GPP TS 23.251 [35];\n-\twhen the SGSN and GGSN pertain to the same PLMN, the Common PLMN ID shall be communicated in SAI/CGI to the GGSN, for both supporting and non-supporting UEs. The Core Network Operator PLMN ID (selected by the UE for supporting UEs or allocated by the network for non-supporting UEs) shall be communicated in RAI.\nIf the Direct Tunnel Flags IE is included and if the DTI bit of the Direct Tunnel Flags IE is set to 1, this indicates to the GGSN that for this PDP Context the SGSN is invoking a direct tunnel. If the DTI bit of the Direct Tunnel Flags IE is set to 0 or the Direct Tunnel Flags IE is absent, this indicates to the GGSN that for this PDP Context the SGSN is not invoking a direct tunnel. All other fields of the Direct Tunnel Flags IE shall be ignored.\nIf the Direct Tunnel Flags IE is included with the DTI bit set to 1, and if the SGSN Address for User Traffic IE and Tunnel Endpoint Identifier Data IE are also included, they shall contain RNC's User Plane address and TEID.\nIf the Direct Tunnel Flags IE is absent, or the DTI bit is set to 0, but the SGSN Address for User Traffic IE and Tunnel Endpoint Identifier Data IE are included they shall contain SGSN's User Plane addresses and TEID.\nNOTE 2:\tUse case, when the DT is still used and the RNC TEID and/or user plane address has changed cannot be clarified in this release for backward compatibility reasons.\nTable 10: Information Elements in an Update PDP Context Response sent by a SGSN\nInformation element\nPresence requirement\nReference\nCause\nMandatory\n7.7.1\nRecovery\nOptional\n7.7.11\nTunnel Endpoint Identifier Data I\nOptional\n7.7.13\nProtocol Configuration Options\nOptional\n7.7.31\nSGSN Address for User Traffic\nOptional\nGSN Address 7.7.32\nQuality of Service Profile\nConditional\n7.7.34\nUser Location Information\nOptional\n7.7.51\nMS Time Zone\nOptional\n7.7.52\nDirect Tunnel Flags\nOptional\n7.7.81\nEvolved Allocation/Retention Priority I\nOptional\n7.7.91\nAPN-AMBR\nOptional\n7.7.98\nPrivate Extension\nOptional\n7.7.46",

      "content": "A Delete PDP Context Request shall be sent from a SGSN node to a GGSN node as part of the GPRS Detach procedure or the GPRS PDP Context Deactivation procedure or from a GGSN node to a SGSN node as part of the PDP Context Deactivation Initiated by GGSN procedure. A request shall be used to deactivate an activated PDP Context or an activated set of PDP contexts associated to a PDN connection. The Delete PDP Context Request shall also be used as part of the UTRAN (HSPA) to UTRAN/GERAN SRVCC Procedure when the source node is a Gn/Gp SGSN as specified in 3GPP TS 23.216 [50].\nA GSN shall be prepared to receive a Delete PDP Context Request at any time and shall always reply regardless if the PDP context exists or not (as per the Delete PDP Context Response message description clause), except in cases described below.\nIf any collision occurs, the Delete PDP Context Request takes precedence over any other Tunnel Management message.\nThe Teardown Ind is used to indicate whether all PDP contexts that share the same PDN connection with the PDP context identified in the request should also be deactivated. This may trigger the deletion of all the information kept for a MS at a GSN, if no other PDP contexts associated to other PDP addresses are active on the GSN. If the Teardown Ind information element value is set to \"1\", then all PDP contexts that share the same PDN connection with the PDP context identified by the NSAPI included in the Delete PDP Context Request Message shall be torn down. If more than one PDP Contexts are active that share the same PDN connection, only the PDP context identified by the NSAPI included in the Delete PDP context Request shall be torn down if the value of this information element is \"0\" or this information is not included. The SGSN shall copy this IE to the Delete PDP Context Request from the associated Deactivate PDP Context Request initiated by MS, if it is included. This information element shall NOT be included by the SGSN if the Deactivate PDP Context Request message from the MS does NOT include the Tear down indicator at PDP Context Deactivation initiated by MS. However, exceptionally this information element shall be included and its value set to \"1\" by the sending GSN only when the last PDP context associated to a PDN connection is torn down and there are no outstanding Create PDP context requests for other PDP context different from the one being torn down for that PDN connection.\nIf a GSN receives a Delete PDP context without a Teardown Indicator or with a Teardown Indicator with value set to \"0\" and only that PDP context is active for a PDN connection, then the GSN shall ignore the message.  (Note: This is symptom of a race condition. The reliable delivery of signalling messages will eventually lead to a consistent situation, allowing the teardown of the PDP context.)\nIn the MS to GGSN direction, the SGSN includes the Protocol Configuration Options (PCO) information element in the request if the MS wishes to provide the GGSN with application specific parameters. The SGSN includes this IE in the Delete PDP Context Request message if the associated Deactivate PDP Context Request message from the MS includes protocol configuration options. The SGSN shall copy the content of this IE transparently from the PCO IE in the Deactivate PDP Context Request message.\nIn the MS to GGSN direction, the SGSN shall include the MS Time Zone information element, if it has changed since last reported.\nIn the MS to GGSN direction, the SGSN shall include the User Location Information information element and the ULI Timestamp information element indicating the time when the User Location Information was acquired. The SGSN shall include the CGI or SAI in the \"Geographic Location\" field of the User Location Information IE depending on whether the MS is in a cell or a service area respectively.\nIn shared networks,\n-\twhen the message is sent from the VPLMN to the HPLMN, the PLMN ID that is communicated in the User Location Information IE shall be that of the selected Core Network Operator for supporting UEs, or that of the allocated Core Network Operator for non-supporting UEs.

The Core Network Operator PLMN ID (selected by the UE for supporting UEs or allocated by the network for non-supporting UEs) shall be communicated in RAI.\nIn the GGSN to MS direction, the GGSN includes the Protocol Configuration Options (PCO) information element in the request if the GGSN wishes to provide the MS with application specific parameters. The SGSN includes this IE in the Deactivate PDP Context Request message if the associated Delete PDP Context Request message from the GGSN includes protocol configuration options. The SGSN shall copy the content of this IE transparently from the PCO IE in the Delete PDP Context Request message.\nIn the GGSN to MS direction, the GGSN may include Cause IE with the value \"Reactivation Requested\". In that case, the GGSN shall include the Teardown Ind information element with its value set to \"1\". If the SGSN supports this IE in this message, it shall map it to corresponding NAS cause code with the same name (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [5]) in the Deactivate PDP Context Request message.\nThe presence of the Extended Common Flags IE is optional. The Voice Bearer (VB) bit field shall be set to 1 if the PDP context to be deleted is used for voice during UTRAN (HSPA) to UTRAN/GERAN SRVCC Procedure as specified in 3GPP TS 23.216 [50].\nThe optional Private Extension contains vendor or operator specific information.\nThe SGSN shall include the Cause IE if the Delete PDP Context Request message is sent to the GGSN due to a network problem as specified in the clause 15.7 of 3GPP TS 23.060 [4].

The IMSI shall not be included in the message if the MS is emergency attached and the MS is UICCless.\nNOTE 1:\tThe rule to include the IMSI when the Cause contains the value \"P-TMSI Signature mismatch\" also applies to an old MME interoperating with a Gn/Gp SGSN.\nThe old SGSN shall also include a SGSN Address for control plane if the Cause contains the value \"Request Accepted\". If the SGSN Context Request received from the new SGSN includes an IPv6 SGSN address, an IPv4/IPv6 capable old SGSN shall include IPv6 address in the field of SGSN address for control plane. Otherwise it shall include IPv4 address in this field. The new SGSN shall store this SGSN Address and use it when sending control plane messages for the MS to the old SGSN in the SGSN context transfer procedure.\nThe Tunnel Endpoint Identifier Control Plane field specifies a Tunnel Endpoint Identifier, which is chosen by the old SGSN. The new SGSN shall include this Tunnel Endpoint Identifier in the GTP header of all subsequent control plane messages, which are sent from the new SGSN to the old SGSN and related to the PDP context(s) requested.\nThe IMSI information element contains the IMSI matching the TLLI or P-TMSI (for GSM or UMTS respectively) and RAI in the SGSN Context Request.\nThe MM Context contains necessary mobility management and security parameters.

The PDP contexts are included in an implementation dependant prioritized order, and the most important PDP context is placed first. When the PDP Context Prioritization IE is included, it informs the new SGSN that the PDP contexts are sent prioritized. If the new SGSN is not able to maintain active all the PDP contexts received from the old SGSN when it is indicated that prioritization of the PDP contexts is applied, the new SGSN should use the prioritisation sent by old SGSN as input when deciding which PDP contexts to maintain active and which ones to delete.\nThe old SGSN shall include the current Evolved Allocation/Retention Priority for each active PDP Context in the Evolved Allocation/Retention Priority II information elements if the information is available.\nIf available, the old SGSN shall include:\n-\tSubscribed and Authorized UE-AMBRs for Uplink and Downlink into the UE-AMBR IE for all non-GBR PDP Contexts according to the subscription of the user.

The old SGSN shall wait for SGSN Context Acknowledge before sending T-PDUs to the new SGSN. If an SGSN Context Acknowledge message is not received within a time defined by T3-RESPONSE, the old SGSN shall retransmit the SGSN Context Response to the new SGSN as long as the total number of attempts is less than N3-REQUESTS. After N3-REQUESTS unsuccessfully attempts, the old SGSN shall proceed as described in clause \"Reliable delivery of signalling messages\" in case the transmission of a control plane message fails N3‑REQUESTS times.\nFor each RAB using lossless PDCP context, the old SGSN shall include a RAB Context. If a RAB Context is included in the SGSN Context Response, the new SGSN shall ignore the N-PDU number fields and sequence number fields received in the PDP Context IE.\nRadio Priority SMS contains the radio priority level for MO SMS transmission, and shall be included if a valid Radio Priority SMS value exists for the MS in the old SGSN.\nRadio Priority LCS contains the radio priority level for MO LCS transmission, and shall be included if a valid Radio Priority LCS value exists for the MS in the old SGSN.\nRadio Priority is the radio priority level that the MS uses when accessing the network for the transmission of uplink user data for a particular PDP context.

If no PDP context is active, this IE shall not be included. The mapping of a Charging Characteristics IE to a PDP Context IE is done according to the sequence of their appearance, e.g. the first Charging Characteristics IE is mapped to the first PDP Context IE.\nNOTE 3:\tThe Charging Characteristics applicable for a PDP context may not be available in the source node, e.g. during mobility from E-UTRAN to GERAN/UTRAN if they are not received from the HSS.\nAll MBMS UE Contexts in the old SGSN shall be included as MBMS UE Context information elements if the new SGSN supports MBMS (i.e. MBMS support indication has been sent from the new SGSN).\nBoth RFSP Index values shall be forwarded to the new SGSN if at least one RFSP Index is available during inter-SGSN mobility procedures. In this case, when one of the RFSP Indexes is not available, e.g. the Subscribed RFSP Index is not received from the HLR/HSS while the RFSP Index in use is included in the message, the value of the RFSP Index that is not available shall be set to 0.\nThe Co-located GGSN-PGW FQDN may be included which applies for a PDP context. One Co-located GGSN-PGW FQDN shall be included per PDP context IE. The mapping of a Co-located GGSN-PGW FQDN IE to a PDP Context IE is done according to the sequence of their appearance, e.g. the first Co-located GGSN-PGW FQDN IE is mapped to the first PDP Context IE. If the activated PDP Contexts of the PDP address and APN do not have the Co-located GGSN-PGW FQDN Information, the length field of the Co-located GGSN-PGW FQDN IE shall be set to 0. If all the activated PDP Contexts of the UE do not have the Co-located GGSN-PGW FQDN Information, the FQDN IE shall not be present in this message.\nThe presence of the Extended Common Flags IE is optional.\n-\tThe Unauthenticated IMSI bit field shall be set to 1 if the IMSI present in the message is not authenticated and is for an emergency attached MS.\n-\tThe Buffered DL Data Waiting Indication bit field shall be set to 1 when it is required to forward to the UE DL data buffered in the old SGW or in the old Gn/Gp SGSN, i.e. when the DL Data Buffer Expiration Time has not expired yet in the old MME or SGSN, as specified in the clause 5.3.13.7 of 3GPP TS 23.060 [4].\nUE network capability provides the network with information concerning aspects of the UE related to EPS or interworking with GPRS.\nThe old SGSN shall include the Signalling Priority Indication with NSAPI IE if the UE indicated low access priority when establishing the PDP Context. Only one occurrence of this IE may be included per PDN connection.

If the UE Usage Type is not available in the old SGSN, the length field of this IE shall be set to 0.\nNOTE 4:\tA UE Usage Type IE with the length field equal to 0 is used for the receiver to differentiate the case where the sender does not support the Dedicated Core Network feature from the case where the sender supports the Dedicated Core Network feature but no UE Usage type was received in UE's subscription. The optional Private Extension contains vendor or operator specific information.\nThe presence of the Extended Common Flags II IE is optional.\n-\tThe Pending Network Initiated PDN Connection Signalling Indication) bit field shall be set to 1 when there is pending network initiated PDN connection signalling for this PDN connection.\n-\tThe Delay Tolerant Connection Indication shall be set to 1 if the GGSN indicated that the PDN connection is delay tolerant.\n-\tThe Pending MT Short Message Indication shall be set to 1 if the source SGSN/MME knows that there is one (or more) pending MT Short Message(s) in the SMS-GMSC for the UE as specified in clause 10.1 of 3GPP TS 23.040 [28], Figure 17c).\nThe old SGSN shall include the UE SCEF PDN Connection(s), if there is at least one SCEF PDN connection for this UE at the old SGSN and if the target SGSN has set the SCNIPDN bit of the CIoT Optimizations Support Indication IE to 1 in the SGSN Context Request, as specified in clause 7.7.120. Several IEs with this type value shall be included as necessary to represent a list of SCEF PDN Connections.\nIf the MS has a PDP context of \"Non-IP\" PDP type at the old SGSN, then in the following cases the old SGSN shall release the PDP context with PDP Type \"Non-IP\" and shall continue with the SGSN Context Request procedure:\n-\tFor a PDP context established through a GGSN, if the target SGSN does not include the CIoT Optimizations Support Indication, or if it includes it but with the SGNIPDN (Gi Non IP PDN Support Indication) bit not set;\n-\tFor a PDP context established through a SCEF, if the target SGSN does not include the CIoT Optimizations Support Indication, or if it includes it but with the SCNIPDN (SCEF Non IP PDN Support Indication) bit not set.\nThe old SGSN shall include the IOV_updates counter if it is supported and available for a UMTS subscriber capable of UMTS AKA.\nIf the Cause contains the value \"Request Accepted\" and the old SGSN has IPv4 and IPv6 control plane addresses of the GGSN available, the old IPv4/IPv6 capable SGSN shall include one of the GGSN control plane addresses in the PDP Context IE as specified in clause 7.7.29 and the other GGSN control plane address in the Alternative GGSN Address for control plane.\nIf the Cause contains the value \"Request Accepted\" and the old SGSN has IPv4 and IPv6 user traffic addresses of the GGSN available, the old IPv4/IPv6 capable SGSN shall include one of the GGSN user traffic addresses in the PDP Context IE as specified in clause 7.7.29 and the other GGSN user traffic address in the Alternative GGSN Address for user traffic.\nOne Alternative GGSN Address for control Plane IE and one Alternative GGSN Address for user traffic IE shall be included per PDP context IE, as follows:\n-\tThe Alternative GGSN Address for control Plane IE and the Alternative GGSN Address for user traffic IE shall be encoded in pairs, one after the other, per PDP context.

These IEs will be included in the Forward Relocation Request message to the new SGSN only if the PS Handover XID Parameter IE and the Packet Flow ID IEare present.  BSS Container IE contains the radio-related network information for the PS handover procedure. Cell Identification IE contains the identification of a source cell (for PS handover from A/Gb mode to A/Gb mode) or an RNC-ID (for PS handover from Iu mode to A/Gb mode) and the identification of the target cell.\nAll MBMS UE Contexts in the old SGSN shall be included as MBMS UE Context information elements.\nUTRAN transparent container, Target identification and RANAP Cause are information from the source RNC/BSS in the old SGSN. The old SGSN shall include in the Forward Relocation Request message the RANAP Cause IE, UTRAN transparent container IE and Target Identification IE when this message is used for the SRNS relocation procedure. For PS handover from A/Gb mode to A/Gb mode, or PS handover from S1 mode to A/Gb mode, the old SGSN or old MME shall set the value part of UTRAN transparent container IE and Target Identification IE to empty, according to their defined minimum length and set the RANAP Cause to cause  #43 \"Relocation desirable for radio reasons\" as defined in 3GPP TS25.413 [7]. For PS handover from A/Gb mode to Iu mode, the old SGSN shall set the RANAP Cause to cause  #43 \"Relocation desirable for radio reasons\" as defined in 3GPP TS25.413 [7]. For PS handover from Iu mode to A/Gb mode, the old SGSN shall set the value part of UTRAN transparent container IE and Target Identification IE to empty, according to their defined minimum length and set the RANAP Cause to the value received from the source RNC/BSS.\nDuring the inter RAT handover from UTRAN/GERAN to E-UTRAN, if the old SGSN receives the target eNodeB ID from the source RNC/BSS, it may include this information in the eNodeB IE in the Forward Relocation Request message to the target MME. The old SGSN shall also include the Target Identification IE, which is mapped from the target eNodeB ID received.\nNOTE 2:\tThere are multiple and not always consistent ways for mapping the target eNodeB ID (RANAP \"Target ID\") to the GTPv1-C \"Target Identification\" IE in the old SGSN. Therefore, if MME receives also the optional eNodeB ID IE from the old SGSN, the MME can ignore the Target Identification IE and use eNodeB ID IE.\nWhen the old SGSN receives RANAP Cause value higher than 255 from source RNC, the RANAP Cause IE shall be included and may be set to implementation dependant value. Please refer to 3GPP TS 25.413 [7] for possible cause values which are relevant to the procedure in progress. When the old SGSN receives RANAP Cause value higher than 255 from source RNC, the old SGSN shall also copy it to Extended RANAP Cause IE, if it supports this IE.\nIf the new SGSN supports Extended Cause IE and if it receives the same from old SGSN, it should ignore the RANAP Cause IE.\nThe old SGSN shall include the CSG ID if the CSG ID is received from the source RNC. The old SGSN shall include the CSG Membership Indication if the source RNC indicates the target cell is a hybrid cell, or if the UE has emergency PDP context(s) and the target cell is a CSG cell.\nFor PS handover from A/Gb mode the BSSGP Cause IE shall be included and shall be set to the cause value received from the source BSC.\nCharging Characteristics IE contains the charging characteristics which apply for a PDP context; see 3GPP TS 32.251 [18] and 3GPP TS 32.298 [34]. If the charging characteristics are available for all the active PDP contexts, one Charging Characteristics IE shall be included per PDP context IE; otherwise no Charging Characteristics IE shall be included. If no PDP context is active, this IE shall not be included. The mapping of a Charging Characteristics IE to a PDP Context IE is done according to the sequence of their appearance, e.g. the first Charging Characteristics IE is mapped to the first PDP Context IE.\nNOTE 3:\tThe Charging Characteristics applicable for a PDP context may not be available in the source node, e.g. during mobility from E-UTRAN to GERAN/UTRAN if they are not received from the HSS.\nThe Selected PLMN ID IE indicates the core network operator selected for the MS in a shared network. The old SGSN shall include this IE if the selected PLMN identity is available; see 3GPP TS 23.251 [35] and 3GPP TS 25.413 [7] for details.\nThe presence of the Extended Common Flags IE is optional. The Unauthenticated IMSI bit field shall be set to 1 if the IMSI present in the message is not authenticated and is for an emergency attached MS.\nIf the Direct Tunnel Flags IE is included and if the GCSI bit of the Direct Tunnel Flags IE is set to 1, this indicates to the new SGSN that a GPRS‑CSI was present in the subscriber's profile in the old SGSN and hence, a direct GTP‑U tunnel was prohibited. If the GCSI bit of the Direct Tunnel Flags IE is set to 0, this indicates to the new SGSN that a GPRS‑CSI was absent from the subscriber's profile in the old SGSN and the new SGSN may or may not wait for the subscriber's profile from HLR before establishing a direct tunnel between the RNC and GGSN. All other fields of the Direct Tunnel Flags IE shall be ignored.\nNOTE 4:\tIf the Direct Tunnel Flags IE is absent, then the new SGSN cannot know if a GPRS‑CSI was present in the subscriber's profile in the old SGSN. Hence, the new SGSN has to wait for the subscriber's profile from the HLR before the direct tunnel decisions are made. Therefore, sending the Direct Tunnel Flags IE allows the new SGSN to make the direct tunnel decisions before the subscriber's profile is received from HLR.\nBoth RFSP Index values shall be forwarded to the new SGSN if at least one RFSP Index is available during inter-SGSN mobility procedures. In this case, when one of the RFSP Indexes is not available, e.g. the Subscribed RFSP Index is not received from the HLR/HSS while the RFSP Index in use is included in the message, the value of the RFSP Index that is not available shall be set to 0.\nThe Co-located GGSN-PGW FQDN which applies for a PDP context may be included. One Co-located GGSN-PGW FQDN shall be included per PDP context IE. The mapping of a Co-located GGSN-PGW FQDN IE to a PDP Context IE is done according to the sequence of their appearance, e.g. the first Co-located GGSN-PGW FQDN IE is mapped to the first PDP Context IE. If the activated PDP Contexts of the PDP address and APN do not have the Co-located GGSN-PGW FQDN Information, the length field of the Co-located GGSN-PGW FQDN IE shall be set to 0. If all the activated PDP Contexts of the UE do not have the Co-located GGSN-PGW FQDN Information, the FQDN IE shall not be present in this message.\nUE network capability provides the network with information concerning aspects of the UE related to EPS or interworking with GPRS.\nThe old SGSN shall include the Signalling Priority Indication with NSAPI IE if the UE indicated low access priority when establishing the PDP Context. Only one occurrence of this IE may be included per PDN connection. Any of the NSAPI values may be used that are associated with the given PDN connection.\nThe SGSN shall include the Higher bitrates than 16 Mbps flag if it is received from the RNC or stored (received from an SGSN via the SGSN Context Response or Forward Relocation Request during earlier procedures) and if the SGSN support it.\nTo enable the target SGSN to initiate an SRVCC handover if required just after the PS handover, the source SGSN shall also include:\n-\tthe Additional MM context for SRVCC IE if the MS Classmark2, MS Classmark3 and the Supported Codec are available;\n-\tthe Additional flags for SRVCC IE if the ICS Indicator is available;\n-\tthe STN-SR IE if the STN-SR is available;\n-\tthe C-MSISDN IE if the C-MSISDN is available.\nThe old SGSN shall include the Selection Mode with NSAPI IE. The Selection Mode indicates the origin of the APN used while activating the PDN connection, which is identified by the NSAPI. Only one occurrence of this IE may be included per PDN connection. Any of the NSAPI values may be used that are associated with the given PDN connection.\nThe old SGSN shall include the UE Usage Type if the old SGSN supports the Dedicated Core Network feature as specified in 3GPP TS 23.060 [4]. If the UE Usage Type is not available in the old SGSN, the length field of this IE shall be set to 0.\nNOTE 5:\tA UE Usage Type IE with the length field equal to 0 is used for the receiver to differentiate the case where the sender does not support the Dedicated Core Network feature from the case where the sender supports the Dedicated Core Network feature but no UE Usage type was received in UE's subscription.\nThe presence of the Extended Common Flags II IE is optional.\n-\tThe Delay Tolerant Connection Indication shall be set to 1 if the GGSN indicated that the PDN connection is delay tolerant.\n-\tThe Pending MT Short Message Indication shall be set to 1 if the source SGSN/MME knows that there is one (or more) pending MT Short Message(s) in the SMS-GMSC for the UE as specified in clause 10.1 of 3GPP TS 23.040 [28], Figure 17c).\nNOTE 6: There may be a pending MT Short Message at the SMS-GMSC during a handover scenario, when the UE performs a Service Request towards the source MME/SGSN and a handover procedure occurs shortly afterward, before the SMS-GMSC is alerted to retransmit the pending MT Short Message.\nThe optional Private Extension contains vendor or operator specific information.\nFor an MS using a \"Non-IP\" connection to a GGSN/PGW, or a PDP context at SCEF, the source SGSN shall ensure that the target SGSN supports this kind of connection based on local configuration before sending the Forward Relocation Request, else it shall release them.\nIf the target SGSN supports it then the old SGSN shall include UE SCEF PDN Connection or PDP Context IE with PDP Type set to \"Non-IP\". Several IEs with the type UE SCEF PDN Connection value shall be included as necessary to represent a list of SCEF PDN Connections.\nIf the old SGSN has IPv4 and IPv6 control plane addresses of the GGSN available, the old IPv4/IPv6 capable SGSN shall include one of the GGSN control plane addresses in the PDP Context IE as specified in clause 7.7.29 and the other GGSN control plane address in the Alternative GGSN Address for control plane.\nIf the old SGSN has IPv4 and IPv6 user traffic addresses of the GGSN available, the old IPv4/IPv6 capable SGSN shall include one of the GGSN user traffic addresses in the PDP Context IE as specified in clause 7.7.29 and the other GGSN user traffic address in the Alternative GGSN Address for user traffic.\nOne Alternative GGSN Address for control Plane IE and one Alternative GGSN Address for user traffic IE shall be included per PDP context IE, as follows:\n-\tThe Alternative GGSN Address for control Plane IE and the Alternative GGSN Address for user traffic IE shall be encoded in pairs, one after the other, per PDP context. The mapping of the Alternative GGSN Address for control Plane IE and the Alternative GGSN Address for user traffic IE to a PDP Context IE shall be done according to the sequence of their appearance in the message.\n-\tThe Alternative GGSN Address for control Plane IE for a secondary PDP context shall be the same as for the primary PDP context.\n-\tIf multiple PDP contexts exist with a mix of PDP contexts with both IPv4/IPv6 addresses and PDP contexts with only an IPv4 or IPv6 address, the PDP contexts with both IPv4/IPv6 addresses shall be encoded first in the message, followed by PDP contexts without alternative GGSN addresses.\n-\tThe Alternative GGSN Address for control Plane IEs and Alternative GGSN Address for user traffic IEs shall be encoded after the SGSN Address for Control plane IE.\n-\tIf an alternative IP address is available either for the control plane or for the user plane (but not both), a pair of Alternative GGSN Address for control plane IE and Alternative GGSN Address for user traffic IE shall be encoded, where one of these IEs includes the alternative address and the other IE is set to a null IPv4 or IPv6 address (i.e. 4 or 16 octets set all to zero).\nEXAMPLE 1:\tAssuming 2 PDP contexts (primary and/or secondary PDP contexts) having both IPv4 and IPv6 GGSN addresses for control plane and user traffic, the message encodes the IEs in the following order: - Alternative GGSN Address for control Plane IE (first PDP context);- Alternative GGSN Address for user traffic IE (first PDP context);- Alternative GGSN Address for control Plane IE (second PDP context);- Alternative GGSN Address for user traffic IE (second PDP context).\nEXAMPLE 2:\tAssuming 1 PDP context having an IPv4 GGSN address for control plane and IPv4 and IPv6 GGSN addresses for user traffic, the message encodes the IEs as follows: - Alternative GGSN Address for control Plane IE (null IP address);- Alternative GGSN Address for user traffic IE (alternative IPv4 or IPv6 address to the one encoded in PDP Context IE).\nEXAMPLE 3:\tAssuming 1 PDP context having IPv4 and IPv6 GGSN addresses for control plane and an IPv4 GGSN address for user traffic, the message encodes the IEs as follows: - Alternative GGSN Address for control Plane IE (alternative IPv4 or IPv6 address to the one encoded in PDP Context IE);- Alternative GGSN Address for user traffic IE (null IP address).\nTable 29: Information Elements in a Forward Relocation Request\nInformation element\nPresence requirement\nReference\nIMSI\nConditional\n7.7.2\nTunnel Endpoint Identifier Control Plane\nMandatory\n7.7.14\nRANAP Cause\nMandatory\n7.7.18\nPacket Flow ID\nOptional\n7.7.22\nCharging Characteristics\nOptional\n7.7.23\nMM Context\nMandatory\n7.7.28\nPDP Context\nConditional\n7.7.29\nSGSN Address for Control plane\nMandatory\n7.7.32\nAlternative GGSN Address for control Plane\nOptional\n7.7.32\nAlternative GGSN Address for user traffic\nOptional\n7.7.32\nTarget Identification\nMandatory\n7.7.37\nUTRAN transparent container\nMandatory\n7.7.38\nPDP Context Prioritization\nOptional\n7.7.45\nMBMS UE Context\nOptional\n7.7.55\nSelected PLMN ID\nOptional\n7.7.64\nBSS Container\nOptional\n7.7.72\nCell Identification\nOptional\n7.7.73\nBSSGP Cause\nOptional\n7.7.75\nPS Handover XID Parameters\nOptional\n7.7.79\nDirect Tunnel Flags\nOptional\n7.7.81\nReliable INTER RAT HANDOVER INFO\nOptional\n7.7.87\nSubscribed RFSP Index\nOptional\n7.7.88\nRFSP Index in use\nOptional\n7.7.88\nCo-located GGSN-PGW FQDN\nOptional\n7.7.90\nEvolved Allocation/Retention Priority II\nOptional\n7.7.92\nExtended Common Flags\nOptional\n7.7.93\nCSG ID\nOptional\n7.7.96\nCSG Membership Indication\nOptional\n7.7.97\nUE Network Capability\nOptional\n7.7.99\nUE-AMBR\nOptional\n7.7.100\nAPN-AMBR with NSAPI\nOptional\n7.7.101\nSignalling Priority Indication with NSAPI\nOptional\n7.7.104\nHigher bitrates than 16 Mbps flag\nOptional\n7.7.105\nAdditional MM context for SRVCC\nOptional\n7.7.107\nAdditional flags for SRVCC\nOptional\n7.7.108\nSTN-SR\nOptional\n7.7.109\nC-MSISDN\nOptional\n7.7.110\nExtended RANAP Cause\nOptional\n7.7.111\neNodeB ID\nOptional\n7.7.112\nSelection Mode with NSAPI\nOptional\n7.7.113\nUE Usage Type\nOptional\n7.7.117\nExtended Common Flags II\nOptional\n7.7.118\nUE SCEF PDN Connection\nOptional\n7.7.121\nPrivate Extension\nOptional\n7.7.46",

This information element shall be included if the Cause contains the value \"Request accepted\" and there is at least one RAB assigned in the new SGSN. During an inter RAT handover to E-UTRAN the MME may provide reserved TEID/ IP address values within the RAB Setup Information, if the MME has determined that no Data forwarding is performed for a RAB.\nThe new SGSN may include its SGSN number. If the old SGSN receives the SGSN number of the new SGSN it shall include this number when informing interworking core network nodes that there is a need to re-route previously sent requests against the new SGSN, e.g. in LCS the GMLC will use this SGSN number to re-activate the Location Request to the new SGSN (3GPP TS 23.271 [24]), or e.g. for MT SMS the SMS-GMSC will use this SGSN number to retransmit pending MT SMS to the new SGSN (see 3GPP TS 23.040 [28]).\nFor PS handover to A/Gb mode, if a cause value is received from the Target BSC, the BSSGP Cause IE shall be included and shall be set to the cause value received from the target BSC.\nIf the new SGSN has received the Cell Identification IE in the Forward Relocation Request message and the PS handover continues for at least one PDP Context, the NSAPI for each of the active PDP Contexts received in the Forward Relocation Request for which the PS handover continues are indicated in their priority order, highest priority first. One instance of the NSAPI IE will be inserted for each of these PDP Contexts.\nThe BSS Container information element contains the radio-related and core network information for the PS handover to A/Gb mode. For PS handover to Iu mode, the UTRAN transparent container shall be used. This information element shall be included if the Cause contains the value \"Request accepted\" .\nThe Tunnel Endpoint Identifier Data II IE, one information for each PDP context, contains the tunnel endpoint of the new SGSN.

After sending the Create MBMS Context Request message, the SGSN marks the MBMS UE context as \"waiting for response\".  A valid request creates a MBMS UE Context within the SGSN and GGSN, (see 3GPP TS 23.246 [26]). Furthermore, a valid request creates a GTP tunnel in the GTP-C plane, however no GTP-U tunnel is created at this step.\nThe Tunnel Endpoint Identifier Control Plane field specifies a downlink Tunnel Endpoint Identifier for control plane messages which is chosen by the SGSN. The GGSN shall include this Tunnel Endpoint Identifier in the GTP header of all subsequent downlink control plane messages which are related to the requested MBMS UE context.\nThe MSISDN of the MS shall be passed to the GGSN inside the Create MBMS Context Request. This additional information can be used when a secure access to a remote application residing on a server is needed. If no MSISDN is provided by the HSS, the MSISDN shall take the dummy MSISDN value (see clause 3 of 3GPP TS 23.003 [2]). The GGSN would be in fact able to provide the user identity (i.e. the MSISDN) to the remote application server, providing it with the level of trust granted to users through successfully performing the GPRS authentication procedures, without having to re-authenticate the user at the application level.\nThe IMSI information element together with the Enhanced NSAPI information element uniquely identifies the MBMS UE context to be created. If available, the IMSI shall be passed to the GGSN inside the Create MBMS Context Request.\nThe End User Address information element contains the PDP type and IP Multicast PDP address that the UE requires to be activated. The SGSN shall include either the UE provided APN, a subscribed APN or an SGSN selected APN in the message. The Access Point Name information element identifies the access point of packet data network that the UE requires to connect to receive the required MBMS service. The Selection Mode information element shall indicate the origin of the APN in the message. The APN and End User Address information element shall uniquely identify the MBMS service.\nThe SGSN shall include an SGSN Address for control plane, which may differ from that provided by the underlying network service (e.g. IP). If the GGSN is IPv6 capable, the IPv4/IPv6 capable SGSN shall include IPv6 addresses in the field SGSN Address for signalling. Otherwise, it shall include IPv4 addresses in this field. The GGSN shall store the SGSN Address and use them when sending control plane on this GTP tunnel for the UE.\nThe SGSN shall include a Recovery information element into the Create MBMS Context Request if the SGSN is in contact with the GGSN for the very first time or if the SGSN has restarted recently and the new Restart Counter value has not yet been indicated to the GGSN. The GGSN that receives a Recovery information element in the Create MBMS Context Request message element shall handle it in the same way as when receiving an Echo Response message. The Create MBMS Context Request message shall be considered as a valid activation request for the MBMS UE context included in the message.\nThe SGSN shall include Trace Reference, Trace Type, Trigger Id, OMC Identity and Additional Trace Info in the message if GGSN trace is activated in the GGSN. The SGSN shall copy Trace Reference, Trace Type, and OMC Identity from the trace request received from the HLR or OMC and the Trace Activity Control shall be set to Trace Activation.\nIf BM-SC trace is to be activated in the BM-SC (via the GGSN), the SGSN shall include Additional BM-SC Trace Info in the message. The SGSN shall populate the Additional MBMS Trace Info IE with the values of the relevant parameters included in the trace request received from the HLR or OMC, and the Trace Activity Control For BM-SC value shall be set to Trace Activation.\nIf Additional Trace Info and Additional MBMS Trace Info are both included within the message, the values of Trace Reference2 and Trace Recording Session Reference shall be the same in each IE.\nFor more detailed description of Trace Session activation/deactivation procedures see 3GPP TS 32.422 [31]\nFor SGSN and GGSN trace record description see 3GPP TS 32.423 [32]\nThe SGSN shall include the Routeing Area Identity (RAI) of the SGSN where the UE is registered. The MCC and MNC components shall be populated with the MCC and MNC, respectively, of the SGSN where the UE is registered. The LAC and RAC components shall be populated by the SGSN with the LAC and  RAC, respectively, of where the UE is located at the time of the MBMS Context invocation. See one exception to this rule below in shared GERAN and UTRAN networks.\nThe SGSN shall include the User Location Information IE, MS Time Zone IE, RAT Type IE and the IMEI(SV) IE if they are available (see clause 15.1.1a of 3GPP TS 23.060 [4] for more information). If the User Location Information IE is included then the SGSN shall include the CGI or SAI in the \"Geographic Location\" field depending on whether the MS is in a cell or a service area respectively.\nIn shared networks,\n-\twhen the message is sent from the VPLMN to the HPLMN, the PLMN ID that is communicated in the User Location Information IE and Routeing Area Identity (RAI) IE shall be that of the selected Core Network Operator for supporting UEs, or that of the allocated Core Network Operator for non-supporting UEs. As an exception, based on inter-operator roaming/sharing agreement, if the information on whether the UE is a supporting or non-supporting UE is available, the PLMN ID that is communicated to the HPLMN for non-supported UEs shall be the Common PLMN ID. See clause 4.4 of 3GPP TS 23.251 [35];\n-\twhen the SGSN and GGSN pertain to the same PLMN, the Common PLMN ID shall be communicated in SAI/CGI to the GGSN, for both supporting and non-supporting UEs. The Core Network Operator PLMN ID (selected by the UE for supporting UEs or allocated by the network for non-supporting UEs) shall be communicated in RAI.\nThe optional Private Extension contains vendor or operator specific information.\nThe MBMS Protocol Configuration Options (MBMS PCO) information element may be included in the request when the MS provides the GGSN with MBMS specific parameters. The SGSN includes this IE in the Create MBMS Context Request if the associated Activate MBMS Context Request from the MS includes MBMS protocol configuration options. The SGSN shall copy the content of this IE transparently from the content of the MBMS PCO IE in the Activate MBMS Context Request message.\nTable 7.5A.5: Information Elements in a Create MBMS Context Request\nInformation element\nPresence requirement\nReference\nIMSI\nConditional\n7.7.2\nRouteing Area Identity (RAI)\nMandatory\n7.7.3\nRecovery\nOptional\n7.7.11\nSelection mode\nConditional\n7.7.12\nTunnel Endpoint Identifier Control Plane\nConditional\n7.7.14\nTrace Reference\nOptional\n7.7.24\nTrace Type\nOptional\n7.7.25\nEnd User Address\nMandatory\n7.7.27\nAccess Point Name\nMandatory\n7.7.30\nSGSN Address for signalling\nMandatory\nGSN Address 7.7.32\nMSISDN\nConditional\n7.7.33\nTrigger Id\nOptional\n7.7.41\nOMC Identity\nOptional\n7.7.42\nRAT Type\nOptional\n7.7.50\nUser Location Information\nOptional\n7.7.51\nMS Time Zone\nOptional\n7.7.52\nIMEI(SV)\nOptional\n7.7.53\nMBMS Protocol Configuration Options\nOptional\n7.7.58\nAdditonal Trace Info\nOptional\n7.7.62\nEnhanced NSAPI\nMandatory\n7.7.67\nAdditional MBMS Trace Info\nOptional\n7.7.68\nPrivate Extension\nOptional\n7.7.46\n7.5A.1.6\tCreate MBMS Context Response\nThe message shall be sent from a GGSN node to a SGSN node as a response of a Create MBMS Context Request. When the SGSN receives a Create MBMS Context Response with the Cause value indicating \"Request Accepted\", the SGSN may be required to register with the GGSN. For further details see MBMS Registration Request procedure.\nThe Cause value indicates if a MBMS UE context has been created in the GGSN or not. An MBMS UE context has not been created in the GGSN if the Cause differs from \"Request accepted\". Possible Cause values are:\n-\t\"Request Accepted\".\n-\t\"No resources available\".\n-\t\"No memory is available\".\n-\t\"Missing or unknown APN\".\n-\t\"Unknown PDP address or PDP type\".\n-\t\"User authentication failed\".\n-\t\"System failure\".\n-\t\"Mandatory IE incorrect\".\n-\t\"Mandatory IE missing\".\n-\t\"Optional IE incorrect\".\n-\t\"Invalid message format\".\n-\t\"APN access denied – no subscription\".\n\"No resources available\" indicates that not enough resources are available within the network to allow the MBMS UE Context to be created. \"Missing or unknown APN\" indicates e.g. when the GGSN does not support the Access Point Name. \"Unknown PDP address or PDP type\" indicates when the GGSN does not support the PDP type or the PDP address. Within the scope of MBMS message, an unknown PDP address is considered to be unknown mulitcast address / service.\n\"User authentication failed\" indicates that the external packet network has rejected the service requested by the user. Only the Cause information element shall be included in the response if the Cause contains another value than \"Request accepted\".\nThe Tunnel Endpoint Identifier Control Plane field specifies an uplink Tunnel Endpoint Identifier for control plane messages, which is chosen by the GGSN. The SGSN shall include this Tunnel Endpoint Identifier in the GTP header of all subsequent uplink-control plane messages, which are related to the requested MBMS UE context.\nThe GGSN shall include a GGSN Address for control plane, which may differ from that provided by the underlying network service (e.g. IP).\nIf the Create MBMS Context Request received from the SGSN included IPv6 SGSN address, an IPv4/IPv6 capable GGSN shall include IPv6 addresses in the fields GGSN Address for Control Plane, and IPv4 addresses in the fields Alternative GGSN Address for Control Plane. If SGSN included only an IPv4 SGSN address in the request, IPv4/IPv6 capable GGSN shall include IPv4 addresses in the fields GGSN Address for Control Plane and IPv6 addresses in the fields Alternative GGSN Address for Control Plane. The SGSN shall store these GGSN Addresses and use one set of them when sending control plane on this GTP tunnel.\nThe GGSN shall include the Recovery information element into the Create MBMS Context Response if the GGSN is in contact with the SGSN for the first time or the GGSN has restarted recently and the new Restart Counter value has not yet been indicated to the SGSN. The SGSN receiving the Recovery information element shall handle it as when an Echo Response message is received but shall consider the MBMS UE context being created as active if the response indicates successful context activation at the GGSN.\nThe Charging ID is used to identify all charging records produced in SGSN(s) and the GGSN for this MBMS UE context. The Charging ID is generated by the GGSN and shall be unique within the GGSN.\nThe Charging Gateway Address is the IP address of the recommended Charging Gateway Functionality to which the SGSN should transfer the Charging Detail Records (CDR) for this MBMS UE Context.\nThe Alternative Charging Gateway Address  IE has a similar purpose as the Charging Gateway Address but enables co-existence of IPv4 and IPv6 stacks in the Ga charging interfaces, without mandating any node to have a dual stack. The format of the optional Alternative Charging Gateway Address information element is the same as the format of the Charging Gateway Address.\nWhen both these addresses are present, the Charging Gateway address IE shall contain the IPv4 address of the Charging Gateway Function and the Alternative Charging Gateway address IE shall contain the IPv6 address of the Charging Gateway Function.\nNOTE:\tThe Charging Gateway Address and Alternative Charging Gateway Address both refer to the same Charging Gateway Function.\nThe optional Private Extension contains vendor or operator specific information.\nThe MBMS Protocol Configuration Options (MBMS PCO) information element may be included in the response when the GGSN provides the MS with MBMS specific parameters.

For the inter‑SGSN Routeing Area Update procedure -the message shall be sent by the new SGSN. The GGSN shall update the MBMS UE context fields accordingly.\nThe Enhanced NSAPI information element together with the Tunnel Endpoint Identifier in the GTP header unambiguously identifies a MBMS UE Context in the GGSN.\nThe Tunnel Endpoint Identifier Control Plane field specifies a downlink Tunnel Endpoint Identifier Control Plane messages which is chosen by the SGSN. The GGSN shall include this Tunnel Endpoint Identifier in the GTP header of all subsequent downlink control plane messages that are related to the requested PDP context.\nThe SGSN shall include an SGSN Address for control plane, which may differ from that provided by the underlying network service (e.g. IP).\nIf an IPv4/IPv6 capable SGSN received IPv4 GGSN addresses from the old SGSN, it shall include IPv4 addresses in the fields SGSN Address for Control Plane and IPv6 addresses in the fields Alternative SGSN Address for Control Plane. Otherwise, an IPv4/IPv6 capable SGSN shall use only SGSN IPv6 addresses if it has GGSN IPv6 addresses available.

This message shall be sent when the first MBMS UE context for a particular MBMS service is created in the SGSN, or when an MBMS registration Request is received from an RNC that is registering for a particular MBMS service that is not present in the SGSN. A successful registration causes the creation of an MBMS Bearer Context in the SGSN, and GGSN. (see 3GPP TS 23.246 [26])\nThe End User Address information element contains the PDP type and IP Multicast PDP address of the MBMS service for which the SGSN is registering. The Access Point Name information element identifies the access point of packet data network that the GGSN requires to connect to receive the required MBMS service. The APN and End User Address information element shall uniquely identify the MBMS service.\nIf the MBMS Registration Request is being sent as a result of the first MBMS UE context being created on the SGSN, the SGSN shall copy the End User Address and APN information from the MBMS UE Context.

If the MBMS Registration Request is being sent due to the first MBMS UE context for a particular service, the SGSN shall send the MBMS registration Request to the GGSN address identified in the MBMS UE context (APN was resolved by SGSN at MBMS UE context establishment). Alternatively, if the MBMS Registration Request is being sent due to an MBMS registration Request that received from an RNC which is registering for a particular MBMS service that is not established in the SGSN, the GGSN shall be selected via APN resolution. If the registration process is successful, the SGSN shall keep this address for de-registration procedures.\nThe Tunnel Endpoint Identifier Control Plane field specifies a downlink Tunnel Endpoint Identifier for control plane messages that is chosen by the SGSN. The GGSN shall include this Tunnel Endpoint Identifier in the GTP header of all subsequent downlink control plane messages which are related to the MBMS Bearer context. If the SGSN has already confirmed successful assignment of its Tunnel Endpoint Identifier Control Plane, this field shall not be present.\nIf SGSN has not established control plane tunnel to GGSN for the given MBMS service, the SGSN shall include an SGSN Address for Control Plane, which may differ from that provided by the underlying network service (e.g. IP). The GGSN shall store the SGSN Address and use it when sending control plane messages on this GTP tunnel for the MBMS Bearer context.

This message is also sent by a GGSN to an SGSN as a part of the BM-SC initiated MBMS De-Registration procedure.\nThe End User Address information element contains the PDP type and IP Multicast PDP address of the MBMS service for which the SGSN is de-registering. The Access Point Name information element identifies the access point of packet data network that the sending GSN requires to connect to de-register the MBMS service, it this is the last SGSN that was registered for the MBMS service or if the MBMS De-Registration was initiated by the BM-SC.\nIf the MBMS De-registration Request is being sent as a result of the last MBMS UE context being deleted on the SGSN, the SGSN shall copy the End User Address and APN information from the MBMS UE Context. If the MBMS De-registration Request is received from an RNC that is de-registering for a particular MBMS service for which the SGSN has no MBMS UE Contexts, the SGSN shall copy the End User Address and APN information from the corresponding message sent by the RNC. If the MBMS De-Registration was initiated by the BM-SC, the GGSN shall copy the End User Address and APN information from the MBMS UE Context.\nWhen the SGSN sends this message, the selection of the GGSN will be dependent on the reason for the de-registration request. If the MBMS De-registration Request is being sent due to the leaving of the last MBMS UE context for a particular service, the SGSN shall send the MBMS De-registration Request to the GGSN address identified in the MBMS UE context. Alternatively, if the MBMS De-registration Request is being sent due to an MBMS De-registration Request that received from an RNC for which the SGSN has no MBMS UE contexts established, the GGSN shall be selected via the address stored during registration.\nTable 7.5A.2.3: Information Elements in a MBMS De-registration Request\nInformation element\nPresence requirement\nReference\nEnd User Address\nMandatory\n7.7.27\nAccess Point Name\nMandatory\n7.7.30\nPrivate Extension\nOptional\n7.7.46\n7.5A.2.4\tMBMS De-Registration Response\nAn MBMS De-registration Response is sent by an SGSN or a GGSN in response to a received MBMS De-registration Request.

In that case:\n-\tthe SGSN shall not send an MS Info Change Notification Request during a RAU without SGSN change or a Service Request (for UTRAN) procedures not requesting to activate data radio bearer(s);\n-\tfor GERAN, the SGSN shall defer the reporting of ULI changes until receipt of an uplink LLC PDU for user data or any valid LLC frame serving as a paging response.\n-\tthe SGSN shall send an MS Info Change Notification Request message in the following cases to report a change of User Location Information which occured during a previous RAU procedure without SGSN change but which has not been reported yet to the GGSN:\n-\tduring a Service Request procedure to establish data radio bearers for the corresponding PDP context for a UE in UTRAN, when not establishing a direct GTP-U tunnel between the GGSN and the RNC;\n-\twhen the SGSN receives an uplink LLC PDU for user data or any valid LLC frame serving as a paging response for a UE in GERAN.\nThe SGSN shall report ULI changes as soon as detected if it is not configured to defer the reporting of ULI changes until a RAB or user plane is established, or if a RAB or user plane is established.\nThe SGSN shall set the header TEID value to that of the GGSN's Control Plane TEID of the corresponding PDN connection. However the GGSN shall be prepared to receive this message in which the header TEID value is set to zero from an SGSN implementation conforming to earlier versions of this specification. When that is the case, the GGSN shall identify the PDN connection context based on the included Linked NSAPI, IMSI, and/or IMEI IEs if the Linked NSAPI is present in the message, or the subscriber context based on the IMSI and/or IMEI IEs if the Linked NSAPI is not present in the message.\nThe GGSN shall consider that the SGSN supports the MS Info Change Notification procedure per PDN connection upon receipt of an MS Info Change Notification Request with the Linked NSAPI IE or with a non-zero TEID (with or without the Linked NSAPI IE). The GGSN shall otherwise consider that the SGSN supports the MS Info Change notification procedure per UE.\nThe SGSN may include the Linked NSAPI IE, with the NSAPI assigned to any of the already activated PDP context of the PDN connection.\nNOTE:\tA GGSN complying with an earlier version of the specification can check the presence of this IE for determining whether the SGSN supports the message at the PDN connection granularity, despite receiving a non null TEID.\nIf the MS is emergency attached and the MS is UICCless (i.e. the mobile terminal cannot obtain IMSI at all) or the IMSI is unauthenticated, the International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) shall be included by the SGSN.\nThe Unauthenticated IMSI bit field shall be set to 1 if the IMSI present in the message is not authenticated and is for an emergency attached MS.\nThe SGSN shall include the RAT Type IE and shall set its value appropriately, respective of which access technology is current being used by the MS.

As an exception, based on inter-operator roaming/sharing agreement, if the information on whether the UE is a supporting or non-supporting UE is available, the PLMN ID that is communicated to the HPLMN for non-supported UEs shall be the Common PLMN ID. See clause 4.4 of 3GPP TS 23.251 [35];\n-\twhen the SGSN and GGSN pertain to the same PLMN, the Common PLMN ID shall be communicated in SAI/CGI to the GGSN, for both supporting and non-supporting UEs.

The SGSN shall otherwise consider that the GGSN supports the MS Info Change notification procedure per UE.\nThe GGSN shall include the same Linked NSAPI value if the Linked NSAPI IE is received in the MS Info Change Notification Request message.\nNOTE:\tAn SGSN complying with an earlier version of the specification determines, based on the presence or absence of the Linked NSAPI IE in an MS Info Change Notification Response, whether the GGSN supports the MS Info Change Notification Request per PDN connection or per UE.\nThe GGSN shall include the IMSI IE if the IMSI IE is received in the MS Info Change Notification Request message.\nThe GGSN shall include the International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) IE if the International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) IE is received in the MS Info Change Notification Request message.\nIf an SGSN receives an MS Info Change Nofitication Response with an unknown IMSI/IMEI, then the message shall be silently discarded and no further processing of the IEs shall continue i.e. the Cause value is not processed.\nThe Cause value indicates whether or not the MS Info Change Notification Request was received correctly. Possible Cause values are:\n-\t\"Request accepted\"\n-\t\"Invalid message format\"\n-\t\"IMSI/IMEI not known\"\n-\t\"Mandatory IE incorrect\"\n-\t\"Mandatory IE missing\"\n-\t\"Optional IE incorrect\"\n-\t\"System failure\"\nIf the received MS Info Change Notification Response contains a Cause value of \"IMSI/IMEI not known\", then the MS Info Change Reporting mechanism shall be stopped in the SGSN for all PDP Contexts associated with the IMSI (or the IMEI if the MS is emergency attached and the MS is UICCless or the MS is emergency attached but the IMSI is not authenticated) received and the GGSN from which the response was received. The SGSN shall then locally delete all of these PDP Contexts associated with the GGSN and release all associated resources.\nFor error handling if the received MS Info Change Notification Response contains a Cause value other than \"Request accepted\", \"IMSI/IMEI not known\" and \"System failure\", refer to clause 11.\nIf the MS Info Change Reporting mechanism is to be stopped in the SGSN for the PDN connection identified by the Linked NSAPI IE (when the Linked NSAPI IE is present in the message) or for all the subscriber's PDN connections towards this GGSN (when the Linked NSAPI IE is not present in the message), then the GGSN shall include the MS Info Change Reporting Action IE in the message and shall set the value of the Action field appropriately.\nIf the CSG Information Reporting mechanism is to be stopped for this subscriber in the SGSN, then the GGSN shall include the CSG Information Reporting Action IE in the message and shall set the value of the Action field appropriately.\nThe optional Private Extension contains vendor or operator specific information.\nTable 7.5B.1.2.1: Information Elements in MS Info Change Notification Response\nInformation element\nPresence requirement\nReference\nCause\nMandatory\n7.7.1\nIMSI\nConditional\n7.7.2\nLinked NSAPI\nOptional\n7.7.17\nIMEI(SV)\nConditional\n7.7.53\nMS Info Change Reporting Action\nOptional\n7.7.80\nCSG Information Reporting Action\nOptional\n7.7.95\nPrivate Extension\nOptional\n7.7.46",

The message at the front of the queue, if it is a request for which a response has been defined, shall be sent with a Sequence Number, and shall be held in a path list until a response is received. Each path has its own list. The Sequence Number shall be unique for each outstanding request message sourced from the same IP/UDP endpoint. A GSN or RNC may have several outstanding requests while waiting for responses.\nThe T3-RESPONSE timer shall be started when a signalling request message (for which a response has been defined) is sent. A  signalling message request or response has probably been lost if a response has not been received before the T3-RESPONSE timer expires. The request is then retransmitted if the total number of request attempts is less than N3‑REQUESTS times. The timer shall be implemented in the control plane application as well as user plane application for Echo Request / Echo Response. The wait time for a response (T3-RESPONSE timer value) and the number of retries (N3-REQUESTS) shall be configurable per procedure. The total wait time shall be shorter than the MS wait time between retries of Attach and RA Update messages.\nFor Intra Domain Connection of RAN Nodes to Multiple CN Nodes, an SGSN relaying a received Identification Request message or a received SGSN Context Request message to another SGSN shall not supervise the Identification Response message or the SGSN Context Response message respectively, i.e. the T3-RESPONSE timer shall not be started in the SGSN relaying any of these two messages. Also, such an SGSN shall not modify the Sequence Number when relaying the Identification Request message or the SGSN Context Request message.\nAll received request messages shall be responded to and all response messages associated with a certain request shall always include the same information.

The SGSN Context Acknowledge, Forward Relocation Complete Acknowledge and Forward SRNS Context Acknowledge messages shall be treated as response messages.\nThe SGSN Context Response message needs special treatment by the old SGSN and New SGSN.\nThe New SGSN must consider this as a regular response to the outstanding SGSN Context Request message, but also copy the sequence number in the header of the SGSN Context Acknowledge it shall send back to the old SGSN unless the SGSN Context Request was rejected. The Old SG SN, when it expects the new SGSN to send back a SGSN Context Acknowledge in response to a SGSN Context Response, shall keep track of the SGSN Context Response message sequence number and apply to this message the rules valid for a Request message too.

Copying of the BSSGP parameters into GTPv1 IEs is straightforward. RANAP, however, uses ASN.1/PER encoding, which is different from GTPv1 specific TLV encoding.\nTransparent copying of RANAP parameters across GTPv1 interfaces:\n-\ta GTPv1 entity shall transparently copy the respective information into one or more octets of the GTPv1 IE as specified in clause 7.7.38 and 3GPP TS 29.274 [52] Annex B.2. With this approach, GTPv1 will not be impacted if the contents of such RANAP/S1AP parameter changes over the time.\nNon-transparent copying of RANAP parameters across GTPv1 interfaces:\n-\tGTPv1 entity decodes ASN.1/PER parameter and shall encode the value(s) into one or more octets of the GTPv1 IE according to what is specified in the present document.",

The field 'No of Vectors' shall be set to the value '0'  if no Authentication Quintuplet is included (i.e. octets '40 to m' in Figure 41, octets '16 to m' in Figure 42, or octets '40 to m' in Figure 42A are absent). If the quintuplet array is present, the Quintuplet length field indicates its length.\nThe DRX parameter  carries the DRX settings that the UE is using within the network.\nMS Network Capability provides the network with information concerning aspects of the MS related to GPRS. MS Network Capability and MS Network Capability Length are coded as in the value part described in 3GPP TS 24.008 [5]. If MS Network Capability is not included, its Length field value shall be set to 0.\nDRX parameter is coded as described in 3GPP TS 24.008 [5], the value part only.\nThe two octets Container Length holds the length of the Container, excluding the Container Length octets.\nContainer contains one or several optional information elements as described in the clause \"Overview\", from the clause \"General message format and information elements coding\" in 3GPP TS 24.008 [5]. For the definition of the IEI see table 47a, \"IEIs for information elements used in the container\". The IMEISV shall, if available, be included in the Container. The IMEISV is included in the Mobile identity IE. If Container is not included, its Length field value shall be set to 0. If the MS is emergency attached and the MS is UICCless or the IMSI is unauthenticated, the International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) shall be used as the MS identity.\nIn Figures 41 and 42A,\n-\tif the UGIPAI (Used GPRS integrity protection algorithm Indicator), bit 7 of octet 4, is set to 0, then bits 4 to 6 of octet 4 shall contain the Used GPRS integrity protection algorithm field, otherwise these bits shall be set to 1 and ignored by the receiver.\n-\tthe GUPII (GPRS User Plane Integrity Indicator), bit 8 of octet 4, shall be set to 0 if the subscriber profile indicated that user plane integrity protection is required and set to 1 otherwise.\nNOTE:\tThe encoding of the bits is not identical with GTPv2 as the spare bits are encoded differently.\nIf Length of Access Restriction Data is zero, then the field of Access Restriction Data shall not be present. The Access Restriction Data is composed of NRSRNA(NR as Secondary RAT Not Allowed). The presence of the Access Restriction Data in MM Context Information is optional.\nNOTE:\tIncluding the Access Restriction Data when NRSRNA is provided allows optimized selection of SGW in case of handover from GSM/UTRAN to E-UTRAN.\nIf Length of Access Restriction Data is zero, then the field of Access Restriction Data shall not be present.

      "content": "The PDP Context information element contains the Session Management parameters, defined for an external packet data network address, that are necessary to transfer between SGSNs at the Inter SGSN Routeing Area Update procedure.\nNSAPI is an integer value in the range [0; 15].\nThe NSAPI points out the affected PDP context.\nThe SAPI indicates the LLC SAPI that is associated with the NSAPI.\nThe Transaction Identifier is the 4 or 12 bit Transaction Identifier used in the 3GPP TS 24.008 [5] Session Management messages which control this PDP Context. If the length of the Transaction Identifier is 4 bit, the second octet shall be set to all zeros. The encoding is defined in 3GPP TS 24.007 [3]. The latest Transaction Identifier sent from SGSN to MS is stored in the PDP context IE.\nNOTE:\tBit 5-8 of the first octet in the encoding defined in 3GPP TS 24.007 [3] is mapped into bit 1-4 of the first octet in this field.\nReordering Required (Order) indicates whether the SGSN shall reorder T-PDUs before delivering the T-PDUs to the MS. When the Quality of Service Negotiated (QoS Neg) is Release 99, the Reordering Required (Order) shall be ignored by receiving entity.\nThe VPLMN Address Allowed (VAA) indicates whether the MS is allowed to use the APN in the domain of the HPLMN only or additionally the APN in the domain of the VPLMN.\nThe Activity Status Indicator (ASI) indicates whether there is an active RAB/PFC associated with the PDP Context. This indicator is of interest when the PDP Context IE is included in a FORWARD RELOCATION REQUEST message or an inter SGSN RAU (SGSN Context Response) triggered by a Directed Signalling Connection Re-establishment.\nNOTE:\tIf the ASI indicates that there is no active RAB/PFC associated with the concerned PDP Context at the source side, no RAB/PFC needs to be set up on the target side.\nThe Extended End User Address (EA) indicates, when set to 1, that the MS uses Dual Stack IPv4v6 address and that octets \"p+3\" to \"r\" shall be included and contain the second part of the IPv4v6 Address, i.e. PDP Type Number at the Octet \"3q+25\" shall be set to HEX(21)  indicating IPv4 and PDP Type Number at the Octet \"p+3\" shall be set to HEX(57) indicating IPv6, or vice versa.\nNOTE:\t3GPP TS 23.060 [4] assumes that if used, the IPv4v6 type should be supported by all SGSNs in a PLMN.\nThe QoS Sub Length, QoS Req Length and QoS Neg Length represent respectively the lengths of the QoS Sub, QoS Req and QoS Neg fields, excluding the QoS Length octet.\nThe Quality of Service Subscribed (QoS Sub), Quality of Service Requested (QoS Req) and Quality of Service Negotiated (QoS Neg) are encoded as described in clause \"Quality of Service (QoS) Profile\". Their minimum length is 4 octets; their maximum length may be 255 octets.\nThe Sequence Number Down is the number of the next T-PDU that shall be sent from the new SGSN to the MS. The number is associated to the Sequence Number from the GTP Header of an encapsulated T-PDU. The new SGSN shall ignore Sequence Number Down when the PDP context QoS profile does not require transmission order to be preserved. In this case the new SGSN shall not include Sequence number field in the G-PDUs of the PDP context.\nThe Sequence Number Up is the number that new SGSN shall use as the Sequence Number in the GTP Header for the next encapsulated T-PDU from the MS to the GGSN. The new SGSN shall ignore Sequence Number Up when the PDP context QoS profile does not require transmission order to be preserved. In this case, the new SGSN shall not include Sequence number field in the G-PDUs of the PDP context.\nThe Send N-PDU Number is used only when acknowledged peer-to-peer LLC operation is used for the PDP context. Send N-PDU Number is the N-PDU number to be assigned by SNDCP to the next down link N-PDU received from the GGSN. It shall be set to 255 if unacknowledged peer-to-peer LLC operation is used for the PDP context.\nThe Receive N-PDU Number is used only when acknowledged peer-to-peer LLC operation is used for the PDP context. The Receive N-PDU Number is the N-PDU number expected by SNDCP from the next up link N-PDU to be received from the MS. It shall be set to 255 if unacknowledged peer-to-peer LLC operation is used for the PDP context.\nThe Uplink Tunnel Endpoint Identifier Control Plane is the Tunnel Endpoint Identifier used between the old SGSN and the GGSN in up link direction for control plane purpose. It shall be used by the new SGSN within the GTP header of the Update PDP Context Request message.\nThe GGSN Address for User Traffic and the Uplink Tunnel Endpoint Identifier Data I are the GGSN address and the Tunnel Endpoint Identifier used between the old SGSN and the GGSN in uplink direction for user plane traffic on a PDP context. They shall be used by the new SGSN to send uplink user plane PDU to the GGSN until new GGSN address for User Traffic is possibly received from GGSN (in Update PDP Context Response).\nThe GGSN Address for control plane and the GGSN Address for User Traffic may be IP addresses of the same type or different types (e.g. IPv4 control plane address and IPv6 user traffic address).\nThe PDP Context Identifier is used to identify a PDP context for the subscriber.\nThe PDP Type Organisation and PDP Type Number are encoded as in the End User Address information element.\nThe PDP Address Length represents the length of the PDP Address field, excluding the PDP Address Length octet.\nThe PDP Address is an octet array with a format dependent on the PDP Type. The PDP Address is encoded as in the End User Address information element if the PDP Type is IPv4 or IPv6.\nThe GGSN Address Length represents the length of the GGSN Address field, excluding the GGSN Address Length octet.\nWhen forwarding the GGSN addresses to another SGSN (in PDP Context IE in Forward Relocation Request or SGSN Context Response message), the IPv4/IPv6 capable SGSN shall include GGSN addresses according to the IP version capability of the receiving SGSN. Determining the Capability of the receiving SGSN is implementation dependent.\nThe old SGSN includes the GGSN Address for control plane that it has received from GGSN at PDP context activation or update. If the new SGSN is IPv6 capable and the old SGSN has IPv6 control plane address of the GGSN available, the old IPv4/IPv6 capable SGSN includes the IPv6 GGSN control plane address in the field GGSN Address for control plane. If the new SGSN is IPv4 only capable or the old SGSN does not have any IPv6 GGSN address for control plane, the old SGSN includes the IPv4 GGSN Address in the field GGSN Address for control plane.\nThe use of Ipv6 addressing in pre-Release 5 nodes can cause interoperability problems and as such the use of IPv6 GSN addressing is not recommended in pre-Release 5.\nThe APN is the Access Point Name in use in the old SGSN. This APN field shall be composed of the APN Network Identifier part and the APN Operator Identifier part.\nThe spare bits x indicate unused bits that shall be set to 0 by the sending side and which shall not be evaluated by the receiving side.\nBits\nOctets\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n1\nType = 130 (Decimal)\n2-3\nLength\n4\nEA\nVAA\nASI\nOrder\nNSAPI\n5\nX\nX\nX\nX\nSAPI\n6\nQoS Sub Length\n7 - (q+6)\nQoS Sub [4..255]\nq+7\nQoS Req Length\n(q+8)-(2q+7)\nQoS Req [4..255]\n2q+8\nQoS Neg.

In this way it is possible to keep consistent values of sequence numbers from the GGSN to the UE (MS in GPRS) by relaying the sequence number across the CN GTP-U bearer, the Iu GTP-U bearer and the Radio bearer (via PDCP or SNDCP N-PDU numbers).

The probability that the received T-PDU is not correct because not awaited is higher if the distance between expected and received Sequence Numbers is high than if this distance is low. This leads to Condition 1. Its left part represents the distance between the Expected and received values, in a circular 65536 dimension.\nThe second one is the duplication of T-PDU frames within a given number of last received frames that have been accepted by the condition 1.\nThis leads to the following actions:\n-This operation shall start when the dialogue is established between the GSNs. When each T-PDU is received during the dialogue, if this T-PDU is valid, its Sequence Number shall be saved. The last \"A\" saved Sequence Numbers represent the \"Recorded Sequence Number Set\".\nA received T-PDU sequence number is valid only if it satisfies both of the following conditions:\n1)\tMin(Abs(E - r), Abs(r - 65536 - E), Abs(E - 65536 - r)) < \"B\"\tCondition 1Where: \"E\" is the Expected Sequence Number and \"r\" is the received Sequence Number.\n2)\tThe received Sequence Number is not a member of the Recorded Sequence Number Set.\tCondition 2.\n\"A\" and \"B\" are parameters. The receiving GSN shall discard a received T-PDU with an invalid Sequence Number.\nAbs(X) represents the absolute value of the number X.\nMin(X,Y,Z) represents the lowest value taken from the numbers X, Y, and Z.\nAnnex B (Normative):SGSN mapping table between Gn/Gp and NAS Cause values\nThe SGSN initiates session management requests towards the GGSN or mobility management requests towards the source/target SGSN. If these operations are not successful, there are several possible cause codes, which need to be mapped to appropriate cause codes over NAS to the UE.\nAdditionally, the SGSN initiates session management requests towards the UE. If this operation is not successful, there are several possible NAS cause codes which need to be mapped to appropriate GTP cause codes over Gn/Gp interface towards the GGSN.\nThe SGSN should map these cause codes as defined in tables B.1 to B.5 unless specified otherwise in the tables.\nTable B.1: Mapping from Gn/Gp to NAS SM Cause values – Rejection indication from GGSN\nReject indication from
