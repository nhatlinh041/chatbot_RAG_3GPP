      "content": "The data stored in location registers are automatically updated in normal operation; the main information stored in a location register defines the location of each mobile station and the subscriber data required to handle traffic for each mobile subscriber. The loss or corruption of these data will seriously degrade the service offered to mobile subscribers; it is therefore necessary to define procedures to limit the effects of failure of a location register, and to restore the location register data automatically. The present document defines the necessary procedures.\nThe basic principle is that restoration should be based on radio contact to avoid faulty data being spread in the system.\nSubscriber data for supplementary services must also be correctly restored, although the impact on service of corruption of supplementary service data is less severe.\nProcedures for supporting these functions are defined in 3GPP TS 29.002 [6] and 3GPP TS 29.060 [8].\nThe MAP operation \"IMSI Attach\" is used only in MAP version 1; in MAP version 2 the same function is performed by the MAP operation \"Update Location Area\". References in this specification to IMSI attach apply only to MAP version 1 network entities.\nIf the restoration of subscriber data in the VLR is triggered by Location Updating or IMSI Attach, the VLR retrieves subscriber data from the HLR by sending an \"Update Location\" request, which triggers one or more \"Insert Subscriber Data\" operations from the HLR. The \"Update Location\" request may also be used to send the LMSI to the HLR.\nIf the restoration of subscriber data in the VLR is triggered by a \"Provide Roaming Number\" request, the behaviour of the VLR depends on whether it is implemented according to MAP version 1 or MAP version 2. For MAP version 2, the VLR retrieves subscriber data from the HLR by sending a \"Restore Data\" request, which triggers one or more \"Insert Subscriber Data\" operations from the HLR. The \"Restore Data\" request is also used to send the LMSI to the HLR. For MAP version 1, the VLR retrieves subscriber data from the HLR by sending a \"Send Parameters\" request with parameter type \"Subscriber Data\", which cannot be used to send the LMSI to the HLR.\nThe VLR number and MSC number in the subscriber data in the HLR are updated by the \"Update Location\" procedure.\nThe GGSN (Gateway GPRS Support Node) is the point of PDN interconnection with the GSM PLMN supporting GPRS. The GGSN contains routing information for GPRS users with a PDP context active. The necessary procedures needed to restore GGSN data information after a restart are described in this document.\nThe SGSN (Serving GPRS Support Node) is the node that is serving the MS. The SGSN stores information regarding e.g. mobility management, routing and security. The necessary procedures needed to restore this SGSN information after a restart are described in this document.\nThe MME (Mobility Management Entity) is the node that is serving the UE when attached to E-UTRAN. The MME stores information regarding e.g. mobility management, routing and security. The necessary procedures needed to restore this MME information after a restart are described in this document.\nA Type A LMU (Location Measurement Unit) is a network node, accessed over the GSM air interface, that is functionally similar to an MS. All requirements associated with a non-GPRS MS in this specification apply also to a Type A LMU except where specified otherwise.",

In this case, the MME initiates release of all S1 bearers towards the Serving GW by sending a Release Access Bearer Request message as defined in the S1 Release procedure in 3GPP TS 23.401 [15]. The MME shall initiate the Dedicated Bearer Deactivation procedure to deactivate the GBR bearers in the packet core; as an option, the MME may defer the deactivation of the GBR bearers for a short period (e.g. in the order of seconds) so as to allow the re-establishment of the corresponding radio and S1 bearers and thus avoid the GBR bearers deactivation if the MME receives a NAS Service Request or a GTP-C Downlink Data Notification message as a result of the SGW having received an Error Indication message from the eNodeB (see clause 22).\nIf the Serving GW receives Release Access Bearers Request message, the Serving GW shall release all eNodeB related information (address and TEIDs) for the UE, but other elements of the UE's Serving GW context shall not be affected.

Upon the subsequent S1 Setup procedure, the MME and the eNB may agree that UE-related contexts and related signalling connection that have been existing before the S1 Setup shall not be affected as specified in the clause 19.2.2.8 of 3GPP TS 36.300 [32].\nThe eNodeB should ensure as far as possible that previously used TEID values are not immediately reused after an eNodeB restart, in order to avoid inconsistent TEID allocation throughout the network.\n15A.1.2\tPWS restoration\nAfter an (H)eNodeB has restarted, it shall delete all its warning message data. If the warning message service is operational in one or more cell(s) of the (H)eNodeB, the (H)eNodeB shall send a PWS Restart Indication message, which shall include the identity of the (H)eNodeB, the identity of the restarted cell(s), and the TAI(s) and EAI(s) with which the restarted cell(s) are configured, to the CBC to request the CBC to re-load its warning message data if applicable.\nThe (H)eNB should send the PWS Restart Indication message via two MMEs of the MME pool, if possible, to ensure that the CBC receives the message even if one MME cannot propagate it to the CBC (e.g. due to an SBc path failure).\nFor HeNBs, the HeNB GW (respectively the MME) shall check the cell identity (respectively the HeNB identity) received in the PWS Restart Indication, as specified in clause 4.6.2 of 3GPP TS 36.300 [32].\nUpon receipt of a PWS Restart Indication message, the CBC shall consider that the warning message service is restarted in the reported cell(s), i.e. the service is operational and no warning messages are being broadcast in the cell(s). The CBC shall then re-send the warning message data (with the same message identifier and serial number) to the (H)eNodeB for these cells, if any. When doing so, the CBC:\n-\tshall include the identity of the (H)eNodeB received in the PWS Restart Indication into the Write-Replace-Warning-Request message(s) to enable the MME to forward the message(s) only to the (H)eNodeB (or HeNB GW) involved in the restart;\n-\tshould set the warning area list to the identities of the cell(s) to be reloaded which are relevant to the warning message data being reloaded; and\n-\tmay update the number of broadcasts requested, if necessary.\nNOTE 1:\tSetting the warning area list to the identities of the cell(s) to be reloaded enables, for example, the HeNB GW to forward the message only to the involved HeNB when the restarted HeNB is connected to a HeNB GW.\nThe CBC shall consider a PWS Restart Indication message received shortly after a preceding one for the same cell identity as a duplicate restart indication for that cell which it shall ignore.\nNOTE 2:\tThe broadcast of warning messages can be configured in the network per individual cell, TAI and/or EAI. The CBC can use the list of cell(s), the TAI(s) and EAI(s) received in the PWS Restart Indication to derive the list of warning messages to be broadcast in the respective cell(s), TAI(s) and EAI(s).\nLikewise, in other scenarios where the (H)eNodeB may need to reload its warning message data (e.g. when an individual cell is restarted), the (H)eNodeB shall send a PWS Restart Indication message (including the identity of the (H)eNodeB,  the identity of the restarted cell(s), and the TAI(s) and EAI(s) with which the restarted cell(s) are configured) to the CBC to request the CBC to re-load its warning message data if applicable. The (H)eNodeB, MME and CBC shall then proceed as specified above for an (H)eNodeB restart.\n15A.2\tS1-AP path failure\nUpon detection of an S1-AP path failure (i.e. no more SCTP association in service),\n-\tthe eNodeB shall either release the RRC connection of the affected UEs, or if UE context retention at SCTP recovery is supported, the eNodeB shall keep those UEs in RRC_CONNECTED and suspended UE Context data for UEs in ECM-IDLE, which have used the S1 signalling connection before it was broken;\n-\tthe MME shall proceed as specified for the eNodeB failure in clause 15A.1.\nThe eNodeB shall continue to broadcast warning messages, if any, during an S1AP path failure. Upon recovery of the S1AP path, the eNodeB shall proceed as if no S1AP path failure had occurred.\nDuring an S1AP path failure, the warning message data stored in the eNodeB may become desynchronized with the CBC, e.g. if the CBC attempts to modify the warning message data during the S1AP path failure. The CBC and MME(s) should support the Write-Replace-Warning-Indication and Stop-Warning-Indication procedures (see 3GPP TS 23.041 [30]) to keep the warning message data synchronized in the eNodeB and the CBC.\n15A.3\tMCE Failure\nWhen an MCE fails, the MCE shall release all the MBMS services affected by the failure locally and towards E-UTRAN within which the MBMS bearer services are active, either immediately or after a pre-configured time period if the corresponding MBMS bearer contexts are not re-established via any MME.\nAn MME that recognises unavailability of an MCE (e.g. no more SCTP association in service) or receives a Reset or a M3 Setup Request message from an MCE shall maintain the related MBMS bearer contexts but shall locally delete the MCE related information (i.e. M3 related resources) for all MBMS service association(s) or those indicated in the RESET message. See clauses 8.5 and 8.7 of 3GPP TS 36.444 [28].\nUpon receipt of a Reset or M3 Setup Request message from the MCE, the MME should then subsequently re-establish the MBMS bearer services affected by the MCE failure by initiating MBMS Session Start procedure(s) towards the MCE. The MME shall encode the contents of the MBMS Session Start Request with the same contents as in the original MBMS Session Start Request (or per the last MBMS Session Update Request received from the MBMS GW if the original parameters were updated) with the following exceptions:\n-\tif the MME has received recently an MBMS session re-establishment indication from the MBMS GW (i.e. within a past short period covering the time during which the same MBMS session may exist simultaneously in two MMEs of the MME pool), the MME shall set the \"MBMS session re-establishment indication\" flag to signal that this message is used to re-establish an MBMS session. Otherwise, the MME shall not set \"MBMS session re-establishment indication\" flag;\n-\tif no absolute start time (\"MBMS data transfer start\" parameter) has been received, the MME may change the relative start time (\"time to MBMS data transfer\" parameter) to fasten the restoration of the MBMS service in E-UTRAN;\n-\tthe MME should set the estimated session duration to a value corresponding to the remaining duration of the session.\nThe MCE shall be able to accept MBMS session requests with an absolute start time (\"MBMS data transfer start\" parameter) in the past.\nNOTE 1:\tDuring an Sm path failure when the MBMS GW moves the control of an MBMS session to an alternative MME in the MME pool (see clause 20.2.3.1), the MBMS session can exist in the old and in the new MME for a short period of time. This time period is not bigger than the value of the maximum Sm path failure timer configured at the MME. If an MCE happens to restart during this time, both MMEs will try to re-establish the MBMS session. In this case, it needs to be ensured that the control of the MBMS session remains at the new MME, whatever the order of the MBMS Session Start Request messages the MCE will receive from both MMEs. The setting of the \"MBMS session re-establishment indication\" flag by the new MME as specified above ensures that the new MME, which has acquired the control of the MBMS session in the recent past, will get the control of the MBMS session.\nNOTE 2:\tIf the MME receives an MBMS Session Update Request from the MBMS GW during the MCE failure, the contents of the MBMS Session Start Request sent to the MCE after the MCE recovery can also differ from the parameters sent to the MCE before its failure for the parameters that can be modified by the MBMS session update procedure (i.e. MBMS Session Area, MBMS Time to Data Transfer, MBMS Data Transfer Start).\n15A.4\tM3AP path failure\nUpon detection of an M3AP path failure (i.e. no more SCTP association in service),\n-\tthe MCE shall release all the MBMS services affected by the M3AP path failure locally and towards E-UTRAN within which the MBMS bearer services are active, either immediately or after a pre-configured time period if the corresponding MBMS bearer contexts are not re-established via any MME;\n-\tthe MME shall maintain the related MBMS bearer contexts but shall locally delete the MCE related information (i.e. M3 related resources) for all MBMS service association(s).\nUpon recovery of the M3AP path, the MCE should initiate a Reset or M3 Setup Request procedure towards the related MME. Upon receipt of the Reset or M3 Setup Request message from the MCE, the MME should then subsequently re-establish the MBMS bearer services affected by the M3AP path failure by initiating MBMS Session Start procedure(s) towards the MCE. The MME shall encode the MBMS Session Start Request with the same contents as in the original MBMS Session Start Request (or per the last MBMS Session Update Request received from the MBMS GW if the original parameters were updated) with the following exceptions:\n-\tif the MME has received recently an MBMS session re-establishment indication from the MBMS GW (i.e. within a past short period covering the time during which the same MBMS session may exist simultaneously in two MMEs of the MME pool), the MME shall set the \"MBMS session re-establishment indication\" flag to signal that this message is used to re-establish an MBMS session. Otherwise, the MME shall not set \"MBMS session re-establishment indication\" flag;\n-\tif no absolute start time (\"MBMS data transfer start\" parameter) has been received, the MME may change the relative start time (\"time to MBMS data transfer\" parameter) to fasten the restoration of the MBMS service in E-UTRAN;\n-\tthe MME should set the estimated session duration to a value corresponding to the remaining duration of the session.\nThe MCE shall be able to accept MBMS session requests with an absolute start time (\"MBMS data transfer start\" parameter) in the past.\nNOTE 1:\tDuring an Sm path failure when the MBMS GW moves the control of an MBMS session to an alternative MME in the MME pool (see clause 20.2.3.1), the MBMS session can exist in the old and in the new MME for a short period of time. This time period is not bigger than the value of the maximum Sm path failure timer configured at the MME. If an M3AP path failure and recovery happens during this time, both MMEs will try to re-establish the MBMS session. In this case, it needs to be ensured that the control of the MBMS session remains at the new MME, whatever the order of the MBMS Session Start Request messages the MCE will receive from both MMEs. The setting of the \"MBMS session re-establishment indication\" flag by the new MME as specified above ensures that the new MME, which has acquired the control of the MBMS session in the recent past, will get the control of the MBMS session.\nNOTE 2:\tIf the MME receives an MBMS Session Update Request from the MBMS GW during the M3AP path failure, the contents of the MBMS Session Start Request sent to the MCE after the M3AP path recovery can also differ from the parameters sent to the MCE before the M3AP path failure for the parameters that can be modified by the MBMS session update procedure (i.e. MBMS Session Area, MBMS Time to Data Transfer, MBMS Data Transfer Start).\n15A.5\tOther MCE functionality for MBMS restoration\nThe MCE should accept an MBMS Session Start Request received for an on-going MBMS session (i.e. with the same TMGI)\n-\tfrom the same or a different MME than the MME that currently controls the MBMS session, if the message includes the \"MBMS session re-establishment indication\" flag; or\n-\tfrom the MME that currently controls the MBMS session, if the MCE supports the option to maintain MBMS bearer contexts during a pre-configured time period after an M3AP path failure, MME restart or MCE failure, and the message is received during that period without the \"MBMS session re-establishment indication\" flag.\nIf the MCE accepts the request from the MME, and if the message contains the \"MBMS session re-establishment indication\" flag,\n-\tthe MCE shall replace the M3 related resources for this MBMS service associated to the previous MME by those assigned in the MBMS Session Start Request (if different) and consider that the MBMS session is now being controlled by the new MME (if different from the previous MME);\n-\tthe eNodeB(s) involved in the broadcast of the MBMS session shall leave the former M1 transport network IP multicast address and join the new M1 transport network IP multicast address (including the IP address of the multicast source) if the MBMS Session Start Request contains a different transport network IP multicast distribution address and/or a different IP multicast source address; the eNodeB(s) shall also use the C-TEID received in the MBMS Session Start Request.\nThe MCE shall be able to accept MBMS session start/update/stop requests with an absolute start time (\"MBMS data transfer start\" or \"MBMS data transfer stop\" parameter) in the past.\n15A.6\tOther MME related functionality for MBMS restoration\nWhen establishing MBMS bearer services in an MCE to ensure the distribution of content from ongoing MBMS sessions to an MCE which modifies the lists of the MBMS Service Areas it serves via the MCE Configuration Update procedure (see clause 5.9.2 of 3GPP TS 23.246 [12]), the MME shall encode the MBMS Session Start Request as specified in clause 15A.3 upon receipt of a Reset or M3 Setup Request message from the MCE.",

How this is ensured is implementation specific.\nNOTE:\tAs the user plane F-TEID pool is partitioned in the SGW-U across the multiple SGW-Cs controlling the SGW-U, the SGW-U does not need to wait for the re-establishment of all the Sx associations from all SGW-Cs to start assigning new F-TEID for new Sx sessions for a particular SGW-C.\n16.1b.2\tRestoration procedure\nDuring or immediately after an SGW-U Restart, the SGW-U shall place local SGW-U Recovery Time Stamp value in all Heartbeat Request/Response and Sx Association Setup Request/Response Messages.\n16.1A\tRestart of a peer node\n16.1A.1\tMME/S4-SGSN Failure\n16.1A.1.1\tGeneral\nThe SGW will receive the MME/S4-SGSN restart counter in GTPv2 Echo requests and Echo response messages that the SGW receives from the MME/S4-SGSN.\nWhen an SGW detects that a peer MME /S4-SGSN has restarted (see clause 18 \"GTP-C based restart procedures\") it shall either:\n-\tdelete all PDN connection table data/MM bearer contexts associated with the peer node that fails as well as freeing any internal SGW resources associated with those PDN connections.

In addition, if the optional feature PGW Restart Notification is supported by the SGW and MME/S4-SGSN as specified in clause 8.83 in 3GPP TS 29.274[13], the SGW shall initiate the cleanup of the hanging PDN connections associated with the SGW and the restarted PGW at the corresponding MMEs/S4-SGSNs by sending GTPv2 message(s) PGW Restart Notification, with the control plane IP address of the restarted PGW and the control plane IP address of the SGW on the S11/S4 interface included. The SGW may optionally perform other implementation specific actions such as messages to clear other external resources (e.g. PCC messages).\nIf an SGW detects that a peer PGW has failed and not restarted, it may delete all PDN connection table data/MM bearer contexts associated with the peer node that fails as well as freeing any internal SGW resources associated with those PDN connections. In addition, if the optional feature PGW Restart Notification is supported by the SGW and MME/S4-SGSN as specified in clause 8.83 in 3GPP TS 29.274[13], the SGW may also send a PGW Restart Notification message to the MME or S4-SGSN. The PGW Restart Notification message shall include the control plane IP address of the PGW, the control plane IP address of the SGW on the S11/S4 interface and the cause value \"PGW not responding\". It is an implementation matter how an SGW becomes aware that a PGW has failed and has not restarted, e.g. the SGW detects a signalling path failure with the PGW for a duration exceeding the maximum path failure duration timer (see clause 20.2.1).\nWhen the MME/S4-SGSN receives this message, according to the control plane IP address of the restarted PGW and the control plane IP address of the SGW on the S11/S4 interface included in the message, the MME/S4 SGSN should delete all PDN connection table data/MM bearer contexts associated with the SGW and the restarted PGW as well as freeing any internal MME/S4-SGSN resources associated with those PDN connections. Additionally the MME/S4-SGSN may decide to restore certain PDN connections based on operator's policy e.g. based on the QCI and/or ARP and/or APN. If so,\n-\tthe S4-SGSN shall deactivate the corresponding PDN connections using the \"reactivation requested\" cause value as specified in clause 9.2.4.2 of 3GPP TS 23.060 [5];\n-\tthe MME shall deactivate the corresponding PDN connections using the \"reactivation requested\" cause value as specified in clause 5.10.3 of 3GPP TS 23.401 [15] if only a subset of the PDN connections of the UE need to be restored or if the UE has a SCEF PDN connection or if the UE supports Attach without PDN connectivity as specified in clause 5.3.8.3 of 3GPP TS 23.401 [15]; if all the PDN connections of the UE need to be restored and the UE does not have a SCEF PDN connection and the UE does not support Attach without PDN connectivity, the MME shall initiate the \"explicit detach with reattach required\" procedure as specified in clause 5.3.8.3 of 3GPP TS 23.401 [15].\nThe MME/S4-SGSN may prioritize the PDN connections to restore based on operator's policy e.g. based on the QCI and/or APN. Besides, the MME/SGSN may use the subscribed Restoration Priority per APN, if received from the HSS, and if permitted by service level agreements for in-bound roamers, to determine the relative restoration priority among PDN connections to the same APN. The MME/SGSN may use a locally configured value as default restoration priority if the restoration priority for a user's PDN connection is not received from the HSS or not permitted by service level agreement for in-bound roamers.\nNOTE 1:\tThe Restoration Priority can e.g. allow to restore with a higher priority users with an IMS voice subscription over IMS users without an IMS voice subscription.\nThe MME/S4-SGSN may optionally perform other implementation specific actions such as to clear external resources (e.g. S1-MME messages to clear eNodeB resources or Iu messages to clear RNC resources) or more advanced forms of restoration.\nNOTE 2:\tThe SGW will have the identity of the MME/S4-SGSN and PGW currently in use for a PDN connection available in the SGW's PDN connection table as part of existing EPC procedure.\nIf PMIPv6 based S5/S8 interface is used and if the SGW needs to send a request for Gateway Control and QoS Policy Rules Provision procedure towards a PCRF which is known to have restarted since the Gateway Control Session Establishment, the SGW may discard the request and may tear down the associated PDN connection, based on operator policy, by sending a Delete Bearer Request message for the default bearer towards the MME/S4-SGSN with the cause set to \"Reactivation requested\". Additionally, SGW initiates an SGW initiated PDN Disconnection procedure towards PGW. This leads the UE to initiate a UE requested PDN connectivity procedure for the same APN. Emergency and eMPS sessions should not be torn down.\nNOTE 3:\tThe procedure above just enables to clean up the PDN connection affected by the PCRF failure when a specific interaction with the PCRF is required. Prior to that interaction, PCC controlled services cannot be provided to the UE.\nFor a split SGW, if the SGW-C detects a PGW failure, it shall initiate a Sx Session Deletion procedure towards the SGW-U.\n16.1A.3\tSGW-C Failure\nThe SGW-U will receive the recovery time stamps of the PFCP entity(ies) in the SGW-C in PFCP heartbeat request/response messages.\nWhen an SGW-U detects that a peer PFCP entity in the SGW-C has restarted, the SGW-U shall delete all its Sx session contexts affected by the restart. When the SGW-U receives a GTP‑U PDU not matching any PDRs, it shall discard the GTP‑U PDU and return a GTP error indication to the originating node (the PGW, the eNodeB, the S4-SGSN, or if Direct Tunnel is established, the RNC); as an exception, if the restoration of PDN connections after an SGW failure is supported as specified in clause 27, the SGW-U shall not send Error indication message for a configurable period after the restart in the SGW-C.\nNOTE:\tThe period needs to be longer than the time required for the peer node to detect the restart of the SGW-C, e.g. the interval between two echo request messages. This ensures that the MME/SGSN or PGW does not deactivate the bearers before it detects the SGW-C failure and triggers the restoration procedure.\nWhen a SGW-U detects that a peer PFCP entity in the SGW-C is not reachable for a preconfigured time, the SGW-U shall delete all session contexts affected by the unreachability of the peer PFCP entity in the SGW-C that it may have stored.\n16.1A.4\tSGW-U Failure\nThe SGW-C will receive the recovery time stamps of the PFCP entity(ies) in the SGW-U in PFCP heartbeat request/response messages.\nAfter an SGW-U restart, the Sx association between SGW-C(s) and the SGW-U has to be re-established.\nNOTE:\tThe SGW-C can determine to re-establish the Sx Association if it receives the cause code \"No established PFCP Association\" in a response message, or if it detects all peer PFCP entities in the SGW-U have restarted.\nRestoration of Sx sessions includes:\n-\tif re-establishment of Sx association is required, the SGW-C may start immediately the Sx association setup procedure, and then;\n-\twhen re-establishing a Sx session and if F-TEID allocation is performed in the SGW-U by network configuration, the SGW-C shall include a restoration indication in the PFCP Session Establishment Request message to indicate to the SGW-U it is for a restoration of an existing PFCP session and the SGW-U shall accept SGW-C allocated F-TEID if possible.\n-\tif the restoration is supported in the SGW-C on a proactive basis, the SGW-C may start re-establishing Sx sessions matching any PDRs.\n-\tif the restoration is supported in the SGW-C on a reactive basis:\n-\tthe SGW-C shall establish an Sx session with a wildcarded PDR to instruct the UP function to forward G-PDU packets which are not matching any other PDRs to the CP function (to a F-TEID uniquely assigned in the CP function for this Sx-u tunnel);\n-\tupon receipt of G-PDUs from this Sx-u tunnel, the CP function shall then check if it has an active session for each received G-PDU packet:\n-\tif so, the CP function shall perform Sx Session establishment procedures to re-establish the corresponding Sx sessions in the SGW-U;\n-\totherwise the CP function shall generate a GTP-U Error Indication with a destination address set to the source IP address of the received G-PDU, and send it to the UP function. The UP function shall forward this GTP-U Error Indication transparently. The CP function shall delete the G-PDU after the check for active sessions.\nNOTE 1:\tThe SGW-U can filter the G-PDU packets with same target F-TEID and send only one such G-PDU to the CP function.\nNOTE 2:\tSuch Sx-u tunnel to forward GTP-U Error Indication can be established per UP function and can also be used to send End Marker packets generated by the CP function. See clause 5.3.2 of TS 29.244 [43]\nThe SGW-U shall not send Error indication message for a configurable period after a PFCP entity restart in the SGW-U  when the SGW-U receives G-PDU not matching any PDRs.\nNOTE 3:\tIf restoration on a reactive basis is used, the period needs to be longer than the time required by the SGW-C to detect the SGW-U restart, establish the Sx association and provision the wildcarded PDR. Otherwise, the period needs to be longer than the time required by the SGW-C to restore all the Sx sessions on a proactive basis.\nWhen the SGW-C detects the failure of an SGW-U without a restart, the SGW-C may select an alternative SGW-U which can take over the IP addresses of the failed one to restore the Sx sessions in the UP function. How this is performed is implementation specific.",

This leads the UE to initiate a UE requested PDN connectivity procedure for the same APN. Emergency and eMPS sessions should not be torn down.\nNOTE:\tThe procedure above just enables to clean up the PDN connection affected by the PCRF failure when a specific interaction with the PCRF is required.

The restart counter signalled in the GTP-C message is associated with the GTP-C entity identified by the sender's F-TEID or SGSN/GGSN IP address for control plane if present in the message, otherwise (e.g. in echo request message) it is associated with the GTP-C entity identified by the source IP address of the message.\nThe GTP-C entity that receives a Recovery Information Element in an Echo Response or in another GTP-C message from a peer, shall compare the received remote Restart counter value with the previous Restart counter value stored for that peer entity.\n-\tIf no previous value was stored the Restart counter value received in the Echo Response or in the GTP-C message shall be stored for the peer.\n-\tIf the value of a Restart counter previously stored for a peer is smaller than the Restart counter value received in the Echo Response message or the GTP-C message, taking the integer roll-over into account, this indicates that the entity that sent the Echo Response or the GTP-C message has restarted.

The MBMS GW timer should be shorter than the MME timer by at least the period between two Echo Request messages sent by the MME, to avoid that the MME timer expires before the MBMS GW timer if the MME starts its timer before the MBMS GW.\nNOTE 4:\tThis enables the MCE to receive a MBMS Session Start request from the new MME controlling the MBMS session before the MCE receives a request to stop the MBMS service from the previous controlling MME.\nWhen sending an MBMS Session Start Request sent to an alternative MME, the MBMS GW shall encode the contents of the request with the same contents as in the original MBMS Session Start Request (or per the last MBMS Session Update Request sent by the MBMS GW if the original parameters were updated) with the following exceptions:\n-\tthe MBMS GW shall set the \"MBMS session re-establishment indication\" flag to signal that this message is used to re-establish an MBMS session;\n-\tif no absolute start time (\"MBMS data transfer start\" parameter) has been received, the MBMS GW may change the relative start time (\"time to MBMS data transfer\" parameter) to fasten the restoration of the MBMS service in E-UTRAN;\n-\tthe MBMS GW should set the estimated session duration to a value corresponding to the remaining duration of the session.\nNOTE 5:\tPer the requirements above, if the MBMS GW had started an MBMS session within an MME with the MBMS Service Area (1, 2, 3) and receives during an Sm path failure (towards this MME) an MBMS Session Update from the BM-SC modifying the MBMS Service Area to (3, 4, 5), the MBMS GW will encode the original MBMS Service Area (1, 2, 3) in the MBMS Session Start Request sent to the alternative MME and subsequently send an MBMS Session Update Request with the MBMS Service Area (3,4,5) to the new MME controlling the MBMS session.\nNOTE 6:\tIf the previous MME received an MBMS Session Update Request from the MBMS GW but could not propagate it to the MCE due to a M3AP path failure, the contents of the MBMS Session Start Request sent to the MCE via the new MME can also differ from the parameters sent to the MCE via the previous MME for the parameters that can be modified by the MBMS session update procedure (i.e. MBMS Session Area, MBMS Time to Data Transfer, MBMS Data Transfer Start).\nAfter detecting an Sm path failure, the MBMS GW shall determine whether the failure is transient or non transient from the perpective of the MME (e.g. the MBMS GW is provisioned with the maximum path failure timer of the MME). The MBMS GW shall assume that the failure is non transient from the perspective of the MME if the Sm path recovers after a period longer than the maximum path failure timer of the MME plus the period between two Echo Request messages sent by the MME, to ensure that the MME also determines this is a non transient path failure if the MBMS GW starts its timer before the MME. The MBMS GW shall consider that the MBMS session has been released by the MME if the Sm path failure is non transient for the MME. If the Sm path failure remains transient for the MME, the MBMS GW shall behave as follows upon detecting the Sm path recovery:\n-\tif the MBMS GW has already moved the control of the MBMS session to an alternative MME(s), the MBMS GW shall send an MBMS Session Stop Request message to the MME previously controlling the MBMS session with a \"Local MBMS bearer context release\" indication to instruct that MME to release its MBMS bearer context locally, without sending any message to the MCE(s).\n-\tif the MBMS GW has not yet moved the control of the MBMS session to an alternative MME (e.g. if the MBMS restoration procedures are not supported in the network),\n-\tif the Sm path failure is transient from the perspective of the MBMS GW, the MBMS GW shall consider that MBMS session is still controlled by the related MME and proceed as if there had been no Sm path failure;\n-\tif the Sm path failure is non transient from the perspective of the MBMS GW, the MBMS GW shall send an MBMS Session Start Request to the MME for the session and encode it as specified above (for a message sent to an alternative MME).\nNOTE 7:\tThe MBMS GW cannot know whether the MME will see the Sm path failure as transient or non transient if the Sm path recovers in the period between the maximum path failure timer of the MME plus and minus the period between two Echo Request messages sent by the MME. This can possibly lead the MBMS GW to send an MBMS Session Stop request to the MME for a session that has already been terminated by the MME (if the MME determined the failure is non transient) or to send an MBMS Session Start request (with the \"MBMS session re-establishment indication\" flag) to the MME for a session that is still alive at the MME (if the MME determined the failure is transient).",

      "content": "In deployments without a Diameter Agent between the BM-SC and the MBMS GW, the BM-SC shall detect an SGmb path failure using either:\n-\tmechanisms as specified in the Diameter Base Protocol (e.g. transport connection failure, MBMS GW peer not responding, Diameter Device-Watchdog-Request and Device-Watchdog-Answer messages during periods when there is no need for other MBMS signalling); or\n-\tthe MBMS Heartbeat procedure (see clause 29), if this procedure is supported.\nIn deployments with a Diameter Agent between the BM-SC and the MBMS GW, the BM-SC shall detect an SGmb path failure using the MBMS Heartbeat procedure (see clause 29).\nNOTE 1:\tA transport connection failure does not allow to identify a failure of the remote MBMS peer. Likewise, it is not possible to rely on Diameter Device-Watchdog-Request / Answer messages to test the responsiveness of the remote MBMS node during periods when there is no need for other MBMS signalling as these messages are only exchanged between Diameter peers with a direct transport connection.\nUpon detecting an SGmb path failure, the BM-SC should maintain the related MBMS bearer contexts.\nDuring a transient SGmb path failure (e.g. before the maximum path failure duration timer expires), the BM-SC should consider all related MBMS bearer contexts as active in the MBMS GW. The BM-SC may initiate new MBMS sessions via an alternative MBMS GW (if available). The BM-SC should defer any MBMS session update or stop procedure for on-going MBMS sessions in the MBMS GW affected by the SGmb path failure until the transient path failure ends.\nNOTE 2: Re-establishing an MBMS session via an alternative MBMS GW can generate network signalling over many interfaces and interrupt transiently the delivery of the MBMS data stream due to the need for related eNB/RNCs to switch to the new IP multicast group over M1. Thus during a transient SGmb path failure it is recommended to defer any MBMS session update or stop procedure for on-going MBMS sessions in the MBMS GW affected by the SGmb path failure. However if the MBMS session update or stop procedure is for time critical services, the BM-SC can immediately re-establish the active MBMS bearer services affected by the SGmb path failure by initiating MBMS Session Start procedure(s) towards an alternative MBMS GW (if available) as specified below, and subsequently send the MBMS Session Update or Stop message.\nWhen detecting a non-transient SGmb path failure (e.g. the maximum path failure duration timer of the BM-SC expires), the BM-SC should re-establish the active MBMS bearer services affected by the SGmb path failure by initiating MBMS Session Start procedure(s) towards an alternative MBMS GW (if available) or towards the same MBMS GW (once the SGmb path is recovered). If the MBMS session is not re-established and if it was activated by a Group Communication Service Application Server(s) (GCS AS), the BM-SC shall notify the GCS AS that the MBMS session has been deactivated.\nNOTE 3:\tThis enables to re-establish the MBMS sessions when a MBMS GW fails without restart.\nThe maximum path failure duration of the BM-SC should be configured with a shorter value than the maximum path failure duration timer of the MBMS GW to minimize the interruption of the active MBMS sessions upon a non-transient SGmb path failure. The BM-SC timer should be shorter than the MBMS GW timer by at least the period between two Diameter Device-Watchdog-Request messages or MBMS Heartbeat Request messages sent by the MBMS GW, to avoid that the MBMS GW timer expires before the BM-SC timer if the MBMS GW starts its timer before the BM-SC.\nNOTE 4:\tThis enables the MCE/RNC to receive a MBMS Session Start request from the new MME/SGSN (and MBMS GW) controlling the MBMS session before the MCE/RNC receives a request to stop the MBMS service from the previous controlling MME/SGSN (and MBMS GW).\nWhen re-establishing the active MBMS bearer services affected by the SGmb path failure, the BM-SC shall encode the MBMS Session Start Request with the same contents as in the original MBMS Session Start Request (or per the last MBMS Session Update Request sent by the BM-SC if the original parameters were updated) with the following exceptions:\n-\tthe BM-SC shall set the \"MBMS session re-establishment indication\" flag to signal that this message is used to re-establish an MBMS session;\n-\tif no absolute start time (\"MBMS data transfer start\" parameter) has been sent, the BM-SC may change the relative start time (\"time to MBMS data transfer\" parameter) to fasten the restoration of the MBMS service in E-UTRAN;\n-\tthe BM-SC should set the estimated session duration to a value corresponding to the remaining duration of the session.\nNOTE 5:\tIf the BM-SC is instructed to modify an MBMS Session during the SGmb path failure, the contents of the MBMS Session Start Request sent to the MBMS GW after the SGmb path failure can also differ from the parameters sent to the MBMS GW before the SGmb path failure for the parameters that can be modified by the MBMS session update procedure (i.e. MBMS Session Area, MBMS Time to Data Transfer, MBMS Data Transfer Start).\nAfter detecting an SGmb path failure, the BM-SC shall determine whether the failure is transient or non transient from the perpective of the MBMS GW (e.g. the BM-SC is provisioned with the maximum path failure timer of the MBMS GW). The BM-SC shall assume that the failure is non transient from the perspective of the MBMS GW if the SGmb path recovers after a period longer than the maximum path failure timer of the MBMS GW plus the period between two Diameter Device-Watchdog-Request messages or MBMS Heartbeat Request messages sent by the MBMS GW, to ensure that the MBMS GW also determines this is a non transient path failure if the BM-SC starts its timer before the MBMS GW. The BM-SC shall consider that the MBMS session has been released by the MBMS GW if the SGmb path failure is non transient for the MBMS GW. If the SGmb path failure remains transient for the MBMS GW, the BM-SC shall behave as follows upon detecting the SGmb path recovery:\n-\tif the BM-SC has already moved the control of the MBMS session to an alternative MBMS GW, the BM-SC shall send an MBMS Session Stop Request message to the MBMS GW previously controlling the MBMS session with a \"Local MBMS bearer context release\" indication to instruct that MBMS GW to release the MBMS bearer context locally in the MBMS GW and in the associated MME/SGSN(s) without sending any message to the MCE/RNC(s).\n-\tif the BM-SC has not yet moved the control of the MBMS session to an alternative MBMS GW (e.g. if the MBMS restoration procedures are not supported in the network),\n-\tif the SGmb path failure is transient from the perspective of the BM-SC, the BM-SC shall consider that the MBMS session is still controlled by the related MBMS GW and proceed as if there had been no SGmb path failure;\n-\tif the SGmb path failure is non transient from the perspective of the BM-SC, the BM-SC shall send an MBMS Session Start Request to the MBMS GW for the session and encode it as specified above (for a message sent to an alternative MBMS GW).\nNOTE 6:\tThe BM-SC cannot know whether the MBMS GW will see the SGmb path failure as transient or non transient if the SGmb path recovers in the period between the maximum path failure timer of the MBMS GW plus and minus the period between two Diameter Device-Watchdog-Request messages or MBMS Heartbeat Request messages sent by the MBMS GW. This can possibly lead the BM-SC to send an MBMS Session Stop request to the MBMS GW for a session that has already been terminated by the MBMS GW (if the MBMS GW determined the failure is non transient) or to send an MBMS Session Start request (with the \"MBMS session re-establishment indication\" flag) to the MBMS GW for a session that is still alive at the MBMS GW (if the MBMS GW determined the failure is transient).",

      "section_title": "General partial failure handling procedures",
      "content": "The partial failure handling is an optional feature for MME, SGW, ePDG, TWAN and PGW. Partial failure handling is an optional feature between SGW-C, PGW-C, SGW-U and PGW-U for split SGW and PGW (see 3GPP TS 23.214 [42]).\nFor split SGW and PGW, the description in this clause related to SGW applies to SGW-C and PGW applies to PGW-C as well.\nA partial failure handling feature may be used when a hardware or software failure affects a significant number of PDN connections while a significant number of PDN connections are unaffected. This feature may also be used for the degenerate case of a full/complete failure of a remote node (MME or PGW) in order to cleanup hanging PDN connections associated with the failed node. When it is impossible to recover the affected PDN connections (for example, using implementation-specific session redundancy procedures), it is useful to inform the peer nodes about the affected PDN connections for recovery on the peer nodes. Such a notification could be performed using an identifier that represents a large set of PDN connections rather than on individual PDN connection basis.\nNOTE 1:\tIf a hardware or software failure happens to impact only an insignificant number of PDN connections the node experiencing the fault need not treat the failure as a partial fault but may tear down connections one by one.\nFor the purposes of partial fault handling the term \"node\" refers to an entity that takes the role of an MME, PGW, ePDG, TWAN or SGW as defined in an SAE network.\nA PDN Connection Set Identifier (CSID) shall identify a set of PDN connections within a node that may belong to an arbitrary number of UEs. A CSID is an opaque parameter local to a node. Each node that supports the feature maintains a local mapping of CSID to its internal resources. When one or more of those resources fail, the corresponding one or more fully qualified CSIDs are signalled to the peer nodes.\nThe fully qualified CSID (FQ-CSID) is the combination of the node identity and the CSID assigned by the node which together globally identifies a set of PDN connections.\nNOTE 2:\tThe node identifier in the FQ-CSID is required since two different nodes may use the same CSID value. A partial fault in one node should not cause completely unrelated PDN connections to be removed accidentally.\nThe node identifier shall be globally unique across all 3GPP EPS networks. Its format is defined in 3GPP TS 29.274 [13]\nFor the purposes of partial fault handling the term peer is used as follows: For a particular PDN connection two nodes are peers if both nodes are used for that PDN connection. For a PDN Connection Set the nodes are peers if they have at least one PDN connection in the PDN Connection Set where both nodes are used for that PDN connection. In particular PGW and MME are generally peers for the purposes of partial fault handling.\nAn FQ-CSID is established in a node and stored in peer nodes in the PDN connection at the time of PDN connection establishment, or during a node relocation, and used later during partial failure handling in messages defined in 3GPP TS 29.274 [13] and 3GPP TS 29.275 [16]. Each node that support the feature, including the MME, SGW, ePDG, TWAN and the PGW, shall maintain the FQ-CSID provided by every other peer node for a PDN connection. The FQ-CSIDs stored by PDN connection are later used to find the matching PDN connections when a FQ-CSID is received from a node reporting a partial fault for that FQ-CSID.\nWith the exception of the GTPv2 Delete PDN Connection Set Request and PMIPv6 Binding Revocation Indication BRI messages, each feature supporting MME, SGW, ePDG, TWAN or PGW shall assign only one FQ-CSID for itself in messages and each FQ-CSID shall have exactly one CSID within the FQ-CSID.\nFollowing rules shall apply for all the nodes:\n1)\tIf a node (MME, SGW, ePDG, TWAN or PGW) supports the partial failure handling feature, it shall generate and include its own FQ-CSID during the PDN connection establishment, node relocation procedures. Explicit list of the relevant GTPv2 messages is given in the respective clauses (14.3 \"Partial Failure Handling at MME\", 16.2 \"Partial Failure Handling at SGW\", 17B.2 \"Partial Failure Handling at ePDG\", 17C.2 \"Partial Failure Handling at TWAN\" and 17.2 \"Partial Failure Handling at PGW\").

It is an implementation/deployment matter how an SGW becomes aware that an MME/S4-SGSN has failed and has not restarted.\nUpon receipt of a Downlink Data Notification message including the IMSI, the restarted CN node shall respond to the SGW with a Downlink Data Notification Acknowledge message and should page the UE and force it to re-attach to the network as specified in clause 25.2.\nNOTE 1:\tIf the UE camps under the service area of the restarted CN node, then the UE re-attaches to the network (see NOTE 1 in clause 25.2.3).\nIf the paging is successful (i.e. Modify Bearer Request is received) for the non-failed ISR associated CN node, the SGW may send a Stop Paging Indication message including the IMSI to the restarted CN node (or the alternative node in the same pool to which the Downlink Data Notification message with the IMSI has been sent before) to stop the paging procedure.\nIf the SGW receives a Create Session Request message as part of Initial Attach procedure for a UE for which the PDN connections, MM bearer context and ISR state have been maintained, the SGW shall stop the timer, deactivate ISR, and delete the maintained resources associated to the restarted CN node (i.e. CN node control plane F-TEID). The SGW may additionally send a Stop Paging Indication message to the non-failed ISR associated CN node to stop the paging procedure.\nNOTE 2:\tThe SGW may have already deleted the restarted CN node resources since Delete Session Request from non-failed ISR associated CN node may arrive earlier than the Create Session Request message.\nIf the non-failed ISR associated CN node received a Cancel Location message from HSS/HLR with \"Initial Attach procedure\" Cancellation Type, the non-failed CN node shall delete all the bearer contexts and send Delete Session Request message(s) to SGW. The SGW shall then release all the resources for this UE and sends one of the following messages to PGWs involved to release all the resources maintained in the PGWs as specified in 3GPP TS 23.401 [15] and 3GPP TS 23.402[18].\n-\tFor the GTP based S5/S8 case, Delete Session Request message(s)\n-\tFor the PMIP based S5/S8 case, PBU message(s) with Lifetime set to \"0\"\nThe SGW shall stop the timer and delete the resources for the maintained restarted CN node (i.e. restarted CN node control plane F-TEID) if it receives one of the following messages while the timer is running:\n-\ta Modify Bearer Request message indicating that ISR is not active, e.g. from the non-failed CN node during a TAU/RAU procedure; or\n-\ta Modify Bearer Request message indicating that ISR is active from another mobility management node with the same type as the restarted node.",

      "content": "This procedure is an optional feature for VLR and MME. It enables the network to continue delivering mobile terminated CS services to UEs via an alternative MME in the MME pool where the UE is located when the MME to which the UE was registered fails without restart or fails for a long duration.\nNOTE 1:\tUEs in idle mode are not aware of an MME failure until they need to send some uplink data or signalling (e.g. a periodic Tracking Area Update) or until they are forced to re-attach e.g. via the network trigerred service restoration procedure. Without support of the procedure defined in this clause, UEs that remain under LTE may not be able to receive mobile terminated CS services for a long duration after an MME failure without restart or a long MME failure.\nThe following requirements shall apply if the VLR and MME support this feature.\nWhen the VLR has to page the UE for a mobile terminated CS service (e.g. upon receipt of an incoming CS call), if the VLR detects that the MME serving the UE is no longer in service, the VLR should send an SGs paging request with a CS restoration indicator to one alternative MME in the same MME pool. The VLR should load-balance the paging requests among the available MMEs in the pool during the restoration procedure.\nThe VLR may know the set of MMEs pertaining to the same MME pool by local configuration or by checking the MME Group ID within the MME name that MMEs signal to the VLR in the SGsAP-LOCATION-UDATE-REQUEST, SGsAP-RESET-INDICATION or SGsAP-RESET-ACK messages. The MME should send an SGsAP-RESET-INDICATION message to the VLR after restart.\nThe VLR may detect that an MME is no longer in service if there are no more SCTP associations in service with that MME.\nNOTE 2:\tSemi-permanent SCTP associations are established between the MME and VLR, i.e. the SCTP associations remain up under normal circumstances.\nThe VLR should adjust its paging retransmission delay to avoid requesting again the UE to re-attach before the restoration procedure completes.\nThe MME shall behave as specified in clause 14.1.3 upon receipt of an SGs paging request not including the CS restoration indicator.\nThe MME shall accept the SGs paging request and proceed as follows upon receipt of an SGs paging request including the CS restoration indicator:\n-\tif the IMSI is unknown by the MME, or if the IMSI is known and the UE is marked as EMM-DEREGISTERED, the MME shall send the paging request with the location information provided by the VLR, regardless of the value of the \"MME-Reset\" indicator. If no such location information is provided, the MME may either page the UE in all the tracking areas corresponding to that MME or in the tracking areas served by the MME and by the VLR, or reject the paging request per operator policy. The paging request shall include the IMSI and the CN domain indicator set to \"PS\" to request the UE to re-attach;\n-\tif the IMSI is known by the MME and the UE is considered to be attached to both EPS and non-EPS services or for SMS only (for an SGs paging request with an 'SMS indicator'), the MME shall page the UE based on the location information stored in the MME.\nThe MME may support and apply this procedure to a UE using extended idle mode DRX for MT-SMS service, and if so, the MME shall page the UE with the S-TMSI.\nNOTE 3:\tHow the alternative MME knows the UE's DRX parameter or the extended DRX parameters to page the UE is implementation dependent.\nUpon receipt of a paging request including the IMSI and the CN domain indicator set to \"PS\", or upon receipt of a Service Reject with Cause #10 – Implicitly detached (when using S-TMSI paging), the UE re-attaches to one MME of the pool (that may not be necessarily the MME that initiated the paging procedure towards the UE) and a new SGs association is established with the VLR. This may be a different VLR than the VLR that initiated the SGs paging procedure, e.g. if Intra Domain Connection of RAN Nodes to Multiple CN Nodes is deployed for GERAN or UTRAN (see 3GPP TS 23.236 [24]).\nNOTE 4:\tThe UE can receive a Service Reject with Cause #10 – \"Implicitly detached\" upon being paged by an alternative MME with the S-TMSI assigned by the MME that has failed. The UE then re-attaches to the network as specified in clause 5.6.2.2.1 of 3GPP TS 24.301 [19].\nIf the new SGs association is established towards the same VLR, the VLR should repeat the SGs paging request after the UE has re-attached to non-EPS services. The MT CS service or SMS is then delivered according to  normal procedures.If the new SGs association is established towards a different VLR, the MT CS service may be delivered via the new VLR using Mobile Terminating Roaming Retry or Mobile Terminating Roaming Forwarding (see 3GPP TS 23.018 [23]); the on-going MT SMS is retransmitted by the SMS-SC using the existing SMS procedures (SMS alert).\nSubsequent MT CS services are delivered as per normal procedures.\nNOTE 5:\tA UE with ISR active before the MME failure and using GERAN or UTRAN radio access will not receive the paging request sent by the alternative MME. The VLR can deliver the MT CS service by paging the UE on the A/Iu interface as per existing principles of 3GPP TS 29.118 [14] when the UE does not respond to a first paging on the SGs interface. Paging the UE on the A interface fails if the network operates in NMO I and the UE is in PS connected mode in GERAN.\nSee 3GPP TS 29.118 [14] for a comprehensive description.",

The PGW shall assume that either all or none of the MMEs/S4-SGSNs in the PLMN support this procedure.Upon detecting an SGW failure with or without restart (relying on restart counter as specified in clause 18 \"GTP-C based restart procedures\" and clause 19 \"PMIP based restart procedures\", or implementation e.g. preconfigured path failure timer), the MME/S4-SGSN and PGW shall maintain the bearers and MM contexts of the PDN connections affected by the SGW failure and eligible for restoration, instead of removing associated resources as per procedures specified in clauses 14.1A.1 and 17.1A.1.\nFor PMIP based S5, when the PCRF detects an SGW failure or restart, the PCRF shall maintain the IP-CAN sessions and delete locally the Gxc sessions affected by the SGW failure.\nNOTE 1:\tThe PGW notifies the PCRF about the termination of IP-CAN sessions associated to PDN connections that are not restored by the MME/S4-SGSN within an operator configurable period.\nThe PDN connections eligible for restoration are determined by the MME/S4-SGSN and PGW based on same operator's policies, e.g. based on QCI, ARP and/or APN.\nNOTE 2:\tThe PCRF is not aware of which PDN connections are eligible for restoration. When the PGW detects an SGW failure, the PGW requests the PCRF to terminate IP-CAN sessions associated to  PDN connections affected by the SGW failure and not eligible for restoration.\nMaintaining the PDN connections affected by the SGW failure enables the MME/S4-SGSN to restore the corresponding bearers of the UE by selecting a new SGW or the restarted SGW. These PDN connections are maintained for an operator configurable period (T-Release-PDN timer), which is locally provisioned on MME/S4-SGSN and PGW, that by default should cover the periodic tracking area update timer (timer T3412) as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [19] or the periodic routing area update timer (timer T3312) as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [20].

For a UE with multiple active PDN connections, some PGWs may support the SGW restoration procedure while others do not support the same. E.g. SGW restoration procedure may be supported for a PDN connection with local breakout while not supported for another PDN connection with home routed traffic.

The MME/S4-SGSN shall control the pace of the SGW relocations to avoid core network node overload. The MME/S4-SGSN should prioritize the SGW relocation for UEs engaged in a Service Request, or a Connection Resume, or RAU/TAU procedures or having GBR bearers over UEs which are not engaged in any mobility procedure and that do not have a signalling connection to the MME/S4-SGSN nor GBR bearers. The MME/S4-SGSN should also prioritize the SGW relocation for UEs with an emergency PDN connection.\nThe MME/S4-SGSN may further prioritize the PDN connections to restore, e.g. for UEs ECM_IDLE / PMM-IDLE / GPRS STANDBY not engaged in any Service Request or Connection Resume procedure, based on operator's policy e.g. based on the QCI and/or APN. Besides, the MME/SGSN may use the subscribed Restoration Priority per APN, if received from the HSS, and if permitted per service level agreements for in-bound roamers, to determine the relative restoration priority among PDN connections to the same APN. The MME/SGSN may use a locally configured value as default restoration priority if the restoration priority for a user's PDN connection is not received from the HSS or not permitted by service level agreement for in-bound roamers.\nNOTE 1:\tThis is to allow all the affected UEs to be reconnected to the network in a relatively short time (that is function of the speed of the SGW relocations that the MME/S4-SGSN performs, based on implementation and the network load) so that downlink packets may be delivered to the UEs with minimum service interruption.\nNOTE 2:\tPrioritizing the restoration of emergency PDN connections can enable to preserve emergency calls in progress for authenticated and unauthenticated users, and enable PSAP to call back authenticated users with an emergency registration but without an emergency call in progress.\nNOTE 3:\tThe Restoration Priority can e.g. allow to restore with a higher priority users with an IMS voice subscription over IMS users without an IMS voice subscription.\nTo restore the PDN connection(s) of a UE, the MME/S4-SGSN shall perform an SGW relocation procedure by sending a Create Session Request message (per PDN connection to restore) to the new or restarted SGW as per the steps 8-11 of a Tracking Area Update procedure with Serving GW change in clause 5.3.3.1 in 3GPP TS 23.401[15]. For PDN connections with GBR bearers existing before the SGW failure, the MME/S4-SGSN may either request to restore or remove the GBR bearers in the Create Session Request (e.g. depending on how quickly the PDN connection is restored).   The MME/S4-SGSN shall restore the PDN connections of the affected UEs after the SGW failure as follows:\n1)\tfor UEs in ECM_IDLE/PMM-IDLE/GPRS STANDBY state:\n-\tthe MME/S4-SGSN shall select a new SGW or the restarted SGW based on the last visited TAI/RAI. When Dedicated Core Networks are deployed, the UE Usage Type shall also be used for the SGW selection as specified in 3GPP TS 29.303 [37];\n-\tthe MME/S4-SGSN shall then perform an SGW relocation procedure as specified above.\n2)\tfor UEs in ECM_CONNECTED/PMM-CONNECTED/GPRS READY state not engaged in any mobility procedure (TAU/RAU, Handover):\n-\tthe MME/S4-SGSN shall release the S1/Iu/radio resources; if the eNodeB/RNC detects the SGW failure, the eNodeB/RNC may request the MME/S4-SGSN to release the S1/Iu resources;\n-\tthe MME/S4-SGSN shall then handle these UEs as specified for UEs in ECM_IDLE/PMM-IDLE/GPRS STANDBY state, or for UEs performing a mobility procedure if the UE performs subsequently such a mobility procedure (e.g. a Service Request to re-establish the S1/Iu/radio bearers);\n-\tas an exception to these rules, for UTRAN without direct tunnel and GERAN, the S4-SGSN may perform SGW relocation while keeping the UEs in PMM-CONNECTED/GPRS READY state (i.e. without tearing down the Iu/radio resources) because S4 user plane is used and the SGW failure remains not visible to the radio network.\nNOTE 4:\tAn SGW failure with restart may be visible to the radio network and cause bearers to be released for bearers with on-going uplink traffic if an Error Indication is received from the SGW before the S4-SGSN detects the SGW restart.\n3)\tfor UEs in ECM-IDLE/PMM-IDLE/GPRS STANDBY state initiating a Service Request procedure or a Connection Resume procedure:\n-\tthe MME/S4-SGSN shall first perform the SGW relocation procedure as specified above and then continue with the Service Request or the Connection Resume procedure since the MME/S4-SGSN has no valid SGW F-TEID to send in the S1-AP Initial Context Setup Request towards the eNodeB or in the Iu RAB Assignment Request message towards the RNC if Direct Tunnel is used.\n4)\tfor UEs initiating an intra-MME or intra-S4-SGSN TAU/RAU procedure:\n-\tthe MME/S4-SGSN shall perform the SGW relocation procedure as specified above before the TAU/RAU procedure;\n5)\tfor UEs initiating an inter-MME/SGSN TAU/RAU procedure:\n-\tIf both the source and target MME/S4-SGSNs support this SGW restoration procedure, the source MME/S4-SGSN should indicate to the target MME/S4-SGSN in the GTPv2 Context Response message that an SGW relocation procedure is needed due to an earlier SGW failure. Upon reception of such indication, the target MME/S4-SGSN shall perform the SGW relocation procedure as specified above and then proceed with the TAU/RAU procedure. The source MME/S4-SGSN may perform the SGW relocation procedure as specified above before responding to the GTPv2 Context Request message if the target MME/S4-SGSN does not support the SGW restoration procedure, e.g. during inter-PLMN RAU/TAU procedures when the target PLMN does not support the SGW restoration procedure.\n6)\tfor UEs in ECM-CONNECTED/PMM-CONNECTED/GPRS READY state for which a handover procedure is initiated:\n-\tThe source MME/S4-SGSN should reject the Handover Required / Relocation Required message received from the RAN (for UEs with PDN connection(s) affected by an earlier SGW failure that have not been restored yet); the MME/S4-SGSN should then release the S1/Iu/radio resources of these UEs to force them to enter idle mode. The MME/S4-SGSN shall then proceed with the procedures specified above for UEs in ECM_IDLE/PMM-IDLE/GPRS STANDBY state, or for UEs performing a mobility procedure if the UE performs subsequently such a mobility procedure (e.g. a Service Request to re-establish the S1/Iu/radio bearers).\nNOTE 5:\tS1/Iu/radio resources of UEs in ECM-CONNECTED/PMM-CONNECTED/GPRS READY state affected by an SGW failure are released very shortly after the SGW failure. Therefore only very few UEs affected an SGW failure and with PDN connections not restored yet may be subject to a handover, e.g. handovers taking place just after the SGW failure before the eNodeB/RNC or the MME/S4-SGSN release the S1/Iu/radio resources. This is why it is not necessary to support SGW relocation during Intra/Inter-CN handover procedures.\nAfter detecting a combined SGW/PGW failure, the MME/S4-SGSN behavior shall be same as in the case when an MME/S4-SGSN receives the optional PGW Restart Notification message. Either of the following shall apply:\n-\tMME/S4-SGSN behavior is determined by clause 16.1A.2 \"PGW Failure\";\n-\tPDN connections can be restored by the MME (this does not apply to S4-SGSN), as specified in clause 31.3 \"MME triggered PDN connection restoration\".",

When a PGW-C/SMF fails with restart, the restarted PGW-C/SMF should continue supporting the same PDN connections, if possible. When a PGW-C/SMF of a PGW-C/SMF set fails with or without restart, the Recovery (Restart Counter) shall not be incremented over S5/S8 (assuming the PDN connection context is still available in the PGW-C/SMF set).\nThe restoration of a PDN connection may be triggered by the MME (e.g. when the SGW detects and reports to the MME that the PGW-C has failed) or by the ePDG supporting S2b over GTPv2, or by the PGW-C/SMF (e.g. scale-in operation or PGW-C/SMF reselection by another network function such as PCF).\nThe procedure supports the restoration of Home Routed PDN connections, if the VPLMN and HPLMN support this procedure. If the VPLMN or HPLMN does not support this procedure, the existing behaviour applies, e.g. the MME and SGW clears all PDN connections of the PGW-C/SMF when detecting the failure or restart of the PGW-C/SMF and the MME may request UEs to release and reactivate some PDN connections (e.g. IMS PDN connections).\nClause 31.6 defines procedures to enable to restore a set of PDN connections affected by a PGW-C/SMF failure with or without restart, or scale-in operation, associated with specific FQ-CSIDs, Group IDs or PGW-C/SMF IP addresses.",
