The present document references the 3GPP TS 29.202 which specifies alternative transport layers that can be applied instead of the MTP. The present document also specifies the SCCP addressing capabilities to be provided in the Gs interface.\nThe present document is divided into two main parts, clause 5 dealing with the use of MTP and clauses 6 and 7 dealing with the use of SCCP.\nClause 5 of the present document deals with the subset of the MTP that is required between an SGSN and a VLR. It is intended that this implementation of MTP is compatible with a full MTP implementation. Clause 4 references the 3GPP TS 29.202 which specifies alternatives to the MTP.\nThe SCCP is used to provide message routing between the SGSN and the VLR. The SCCP routing principles specified in the present document allow to connect one SGSN to several VLR. No segmentation at SCCP level is needed on the Gs interface. Only SCCP class 0 is used on the Gs interface. Clauses 6 and 7 identify the SCCP subset that should be used between an SGSN and an VLR.",

Only the needs of the user of SCCP (refer to 3GPP TS 29.018) are taken into account in this clause: the operations and maintenance requirements about SCCP functions are outside the scope of the present document.\nNo SCCP translation function is required in the VLR or the SGSN between the national and the local MTP. The Destination Point Code and Subsystem Number would allow direct routing by the local SCCP and MTP. Global Title addressing is supported on the Gs interface to provide flexibility in the addressing scheme implementation (note that the SGSN is assigned a global title in order to communicate with an HLR across an inter PLMN boundary).\nOnly connectionless class 0 SCCP services are used on the Gs interface. These simplifications are applicable to the signalling between an SGSN and a VLR in GSM PLMNs.\nThe minimum set of SCCP functions which apply are specified in the ITU-T Recommendations Q.711, Q.712, Q.713 and Q.714, for E1 interface and ANSI T1.112 for T1 interface with the qualifications specified in this Recommendation.",

      "content": "The underlying transport stack and the SCCP are used to support signalling messages between the SGSN and the MSC. The BSSAP+ protocol specified in 3GPP TS 29.018 is the user of the SCCP. 3GPP TS 29.018 only uses the services of the class 0 of the  SCCP.\nThe Gs interface connects an SGSN to a VLR within the same PLMN. The use of point codes or global titles is allowed for routing of SCCP messages.\nThe format and coding of address parameters carried by the SCCP for routing purpose shall comply with ITU-T Recommendation Q.713 for E1 interface and ANSI T1.112.3 T1 interface with the following restrictions:\n-\tThe called party address shall include:\n-\tan SSN (see subclause 6.4.1 E1 interface and subclause 6.4.2 for T1 interface);\n-\tall other aspects of the SCCP signalling are specified in 3GPP TS 29.002.\n-\tThe calling party address shall include:\n-\tan SSN (see subclause 6.4.1 E1 interface and subclause 6.4.2 for T1 interface);\n-\tall other aspects of the SCCP signalling are specified in 3GPP TS 29.002.\nWhen an SCCP message is sent, the Called Party Address is derived from the Called Address of the N-UNITDATA-REQUEST primitive issued by the local SCCP user.\nWhen an SCCP message is received, the Calling Address within the N-UNITDATA-INDICATION primitive is derived from the Calling Party Address of the SCCP UNITDATA message received.\nOnly address information belonging to the E.164 numbering plan is allowed to be included as Global Title in the Called and Calling Party Address. The SGSN and the VLR store the address of the other entity using the format received in the Calling Party Address field or the address information received in the application part of the message.\nAnnex A (informative):Change history\nChange history\nTSG CN#\nSpec\nVersion\nCR\n<Phase>\nNew Version\nSubject/Comment\nApr 1999\nGSM 09.16\n7.0.0\nTransferred to 3GPP CN1\nCN#03\n29.016\n3.0.0\nApproved at CN#03\nTSGMeet-ing\nTSG Docnumber\nTSG WGdocnumber\nCR\nRev\nPh\nCat\nVersOld\nVersNew\nSubject\nDate\nNP-09\nNP-000441\nN1-001017\n004\n1\nR99\nF\n3.0.0\n3.1.0\nDifferent SSNs for SGSN and VLR\n09-2000\nNP-11\nNP-0100150\nN1-010459\n005\n1\nRel-4\nC\n3.1.0\n4.0.0\nBSSAP+ over IP according to SIGTRAN\n03-2001\nNP-16\nNP-020224\nN1-021326\n006\nRel-4\nF\n4.0.0\n4.1.0\nVarious clean-up of wrong references\n06-2002\nNP-16\nRel-5\n4.1.0\n5.0.0\nCN plenary decision to make this 3GPP TS 29.016 also for Release 5.\n06-2002\nNP-26\nRel-6\n5.0.0\n6.0.0\nRel-6 published after CN#26\n12-2004\nRel-7\n6.0.0\n7.0.0\nCN plenary decision to make this 3GPP TS 29.016 also for Release 7.\n06-2007\nRel-8\n7.0.0\n8.0.0\nUpgrade to Rel-8 (CT#42)\n12-2008\nRel-9\n8.0.0\n9.0.0\nUpgrade to Rel-9 (CT#46)\n12-2009\nRel-10\n9.0.0\n10.0.0\nUpgrade to Rel-10 (CT#51)\n03-2011\nRel-11\n10.0.0\n11.0.0\nUpgrade to Rel-11 (CT#57)\n09-2012\nRel-12\n11.0.0\n12.0.0\nUpgrade to Rel-12 (CT#65)\n09-2014\nRel-13\n12.0.0\n13.0.0\nUpgrade to Rel-13 (CT#70)\n12-2015\nChange history\nDate\nMeeting\nTDoc\nCR\nRev\nCat\nSubject/Comment\nNew version\n2017-03\nSA#75\nUpgrade to Rel-14\n14.0.0\n2018-06\nSA#80\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-15 version (MCC)\n15.0.0\n2020-07\nSA#88e\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-16 version (MCC)\n16.0.0\n2022-04\nSA#95e-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-17 version (MCC)\n17.0.0\n2024-04\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-18 version (MCC)\n18.0.0",
