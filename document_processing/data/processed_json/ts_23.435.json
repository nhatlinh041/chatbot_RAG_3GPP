      "content": "NSCE layer provides value added services to VAL customers, based on consuming 5GS services related to slicing (from OAM, 5GC) and based on interacting with the VAL UE side. The variety of services and the deployment aspects depend on the different assumptions for the slice owner / provider, the slice customer and the SEAL service provider. With respect to NSCE, the NSCE server belongs to the SEAL provider (as stated in TS 23.434 [2] clause 5) who can be either the MNO itself, or the vertical customer (e.g. factory owner, automaker X) or the edge/cloud provider (e.g. hyperscaler) who provides such platform services related to slice capability exposure to the vertical customer on top of the MNO. Thus, NSCE can play different roles based on the business models. For example, NSCE server can be:\n-\tdeployed by NOP / MNO.\n-\tdeployed by an Edge / Cloud Provider. In this case, it is assumed that the NSCE server is acting as an authorized AF/AS.\n-\tdeployed by a vertical industry, which can be the end slice customer.\nFrom business perspective, the following business model applies. In Figure 5-1, the different interactions among all the involved entities are provided. More specifically, in this model the end user is the consumer of the applications provided by the vertical/ASP and can have app-level service agreement with vertical/ASP(s).\nThe end user/UE also has a PLMN subscription arrangement with the MNO. The UE used by the end user is allowed to be registered on the MNO's network. MNO (via OAM) can have a slice SLA with the vertical / ASP, which is optional when vertical customer is the NSC. In addition, due to the involvement of a NSCE service provider, additional agreements can be possible between the NSCE server and VAL/ASP layer and the NOP/MNO(s):\n-\tthe enablement service agreement between VAL/ASP layer and the NSCE service provider include the agreement on the value-added services, which in case on NSaaS these are services related to the consumed slice from NOP. So, the end customer (VAL) subscribes to NSCE server for receiving additional services for optimizing the slice utilization. In case that the NSCE server is a NSP towards VAL customer, then such agreement can relate to slice SLA (for the slice provided by the NSCE server). When the NSCE server is part of the vertical, the service agreement between VAL/ASP layer and the NSCE service provider is internal to a single organization.\n-\tthe service agreement between MNO and NSCE service provider is for consuming 5GS services (and being also authorized to provide additional services on top). Such agreement could be also a slice SLA for the scenarios when NSCE server is the NSC of the MNO (in NSaaS model).\nFigure 5-1: Business relationships\nIn case of shared RAN between operators, one NSCE service provider (slice service provider) can use NSCE to offer slice services using resources of these operators to end customer (VAL) using the shared RAN via one or both operators.\nIn case of national roaming between operators, one NSCE service provider (slice service provider) can use NSCE to offer slice services using resources of these operators to end customer (VAL).",

In this procedure, the NSCE server initially receives a slice API invocation request from the vertical application.

The request can indicate whether the notification is needed before performing the AppLayer-NS-LCM. The request can also indicate the trigger conditions, such as by providing the monitored parameters and the corresponding thresholds as described in clause 9.4.3.2.\n2.\tAfter receiving the request, the NSCE server checks that the user is authenticated and authorized to perform the corresponding AppLayer-NS-LCM operations, and filters the unauthorized requests, if any.\n3.\tAccording to network slice requirements and/or the trigger conditions, NSCE server triggers the provision of network slice status and QoE metrics.

The request contains the policy, VAL server ID, Default policy indication, and S-NSSAI. Optionally, the request contains the indicator of policy harmonization.\nThe VAL server can request the NSCE server to mark the provisioned policy as the default policy using the Default policy indication. The default policy should serve as a VAL server policy for the slices provisioned without any policy. Either the policy or default policy indication can be provided by the VAL server.\nThe VAL server policy is in form of a policy profile which contains list of trigger events associated with the parameters and expected actions. It contains priority and scheduling information with pre-emption capability for the policies. The scheduling information schedules the policy by defining the schedule (start and end time) for the policy. The pre-emption capability provides another, already successfully provisioned policy to pre-empt the scheduled policy in the scheduled period.\nThe supported policies are:\n-\tBased on monitored performance metric from OAM, when the max number of PDU sessions or max number of UE is reached, trigger the slice modification with expected parameters.\n-\tBased on monitored Network Slice load from NSACF, when the number of PDU sessions or number of UE exceeds the threshold, trigger the slice modification with expected parameters.\n-\tBased on monitored Network Slice load predictions from NWDAF, when Network Slice load predictions (Predicted Number of PDU Session establishments at the Network Slice) exceeds the threshold with high confidence, trigger the slice modification with expected parameters.\n-\tBased on the monitored the time period, when getting to a certain time period (e.g. summer vacation, spring festival etc.), trigger the slice modification with expected parameters.\n-\tBased on the monitored time period, when getting to a certain time period, trigger the slice modification based on the expected QoS per UE. QoS is mapped/calculated by NSCE to specific parameters of the slice such as the dLThptPerUE, uLThptPerUE, dLThptPerSliceSubnet, uLThptPerSliceSubnet, delayTolerance, dLLatency, uLLatency.\n2.\tThe NSCE server checks whether the policy is conflict with the MNO policies or NSPP. One criterion is to translate the network slice parameters in the service profile to see whether it is conflict with that in the VAL provided policy. If policy harmonization is not requested and policies conflict then the request could be rejected. The NSCE server also checks the validity of the policy (policy is valid for the specified time period or until the specified threshold count of trigger events is achieved) to avoid a ping-pong effect of slice modification. If the policy is invalid, the request could be rejected.\n3.\tIf the policy harmonization is requested, the NSCE server can harmonize the policy as per clause 9.5.2.1.4 and this may result in the changes to the current VAL server policy under provisioning.\n4.\tNSCE server sends the VAL server policy provisioning response to the VAL server to indicate whether the request is successful or not.

All MD features/capabilities come with a pre-configured exposure, where this can be configured by the operator for a given slice.

Exposure refers to the permissions that the 3rd party entity has gained over its use of the management service, e.g., the ability to read, or execute or modify or delete can be considered as different sorts of exposure.\nThe first procedure (9.6.2.1) provides the NSCE server support for translating the VAL server request to a MnS requirement and the exposure of service/management data related to his request.

Such query may be in form of a request/response and include:\na.\tS-NSCE server interacting with 5GC to query the UE specific information (location, UE connection capabilities) as well as network conditions (network monitoring from NEF) and/or slice related analytics on the slice load (from NWDAF as specified in TS 23.288 [4]).\nb.\tS-NSCE server may also interact with OAM to query on the target slice availability and the up-to-date configured slice parameters e.g. slice RRM policies, modification of the NSI/NSSI resources (see TS 28.531 [8], 5.1.12) at the target service area and measurements for the slice at the target area.\n4.\tS-NSCE server evaluates whether new NSCE service area supports slice #1 and if slice #1 offers similar performance in target area.\n5.\tIf the current slice doesn't fulfil these requirements, S-NSCE sends to the T-NSCE server (covering the target area) a service continuity negotiation request (including the VAL application service continuity requirement and optionally a proposed action) to negotiate on the trigger action.\n6.\tT-NSCE server determines the need for a slice lifecycle change at the target area and translates this to a trigger action. This trigger action can be based on the proposed action in step 5 and can be a requested slice modification or the slice #1 creation/instantiation at the target area (this may happen if a group of UEs are moving to the target area and use slice #1, so it may be beneficial to create slice #1 at the target area).\n7.\tT-NSCE server sends to the S-NSCE server a service continuity negotiation response including the determined trigger action.\n8.\tThe S- or T-NSCE server may send the trigger action as a slice modification trigger request to the slice provisioning MnS producer at OAM (e.g. slice modification for network slice) to extend slice availability to the target service area based on the expected/predicted VAL UE or VAL group mobility. As response to the trigger action, the provisioning MnS producer provides a slice modification trigger response to the corresponding NSCE server with a positive or negative result.\n9.\tAfter the slice lifecycle change execution (based on the indication in step 5), the S-NSCE server sends a notification to the VAL server and optionally to the VAL client via S-NSCE client\n10.\tIf the NSCE client needs to be remapped to different NSCE server (due to the expected change of UE location), the NSCE client establishes a new connection with T-NSCE and terminates the one with S-NSCE (in case of subscription-based interaction), or in case of request-based interaction, it updates the mapping at the client side, and maintains the new NSCE server address / ID for the target NSCE area.",

In this feature, the NSCE server initially receives an expected/predicted UE location/mobility change request outside a PLMN1 slice service area for one or more UEs within the VAL application session (e.g. such session can be a V2X session). Then, the NSCE server checks with 5GS (OAM, 5GC) whether the serving slice is available and can offer the same performance at the target PLMN. The NSCE server evaluates the need for a slice modification (e.g. a slice lifecycle related trigger change). Based on this decision/recommendation, it provides the action to the OAM of PLMN2 proactively, before UE mobility happens.",

The VAL server correlated received mobility predictions and determined PLMN change.\nFigure 9.13.2-1: Predictive Inter-PLMN slice service continuity\n1.\tThe VAL server sends to NSCE server an Inter-PLMN application service continuity requirement request due to predicted/expected UE or group UE mobility from source service area of slice1 in PLMN1 to a target service area covered by a different slice service area in slice#2/PLMN2.\nNOTE:\tSuch UE predicted mobility at the VAL server can be available before the event based on UE mobility analytics received by NWDAF or can be predicted by the VAL layer (VAL server or VAL UE).\n2.\tNSCE server sends an Inter-PLMN application service continuity requirement response to the VAL server as positive or negative acknowledgement depending on its capability to provide such service serving both areas/slices in both PLMNs and available resources.\n3.\tNSCE server determines to query the underlying 5G system on the slice availability and conditions at the target service area/slice2/PLMN2 (based on step 1 requirement). Such query may be in form of a request/response and include:\na.\tNSCE server interacting with 5GS/PLMN2 to query the UEs specific information (location, UEs connection capabilities) as well as network conditions, slice related analytics (from NWDAF as specified in 3GPP TS 23.288 [4]).\nb.\tNSCE server may also interact with 5GS/PLMN2 to query on the target slice availability and the up-to-date configured slice parameters e.g. slice RRM policies, modification of the NSI/NSSI resources (see TS 28.531 [8], 5.1.12) at the target service area and measurements for the slice at the target area.\n4.\tNSCE server determines the need for a slice lifecycle change at the slice target area and translates this to a trigger action. This trigger action can be based on the outcome of step 3 and can be a requested slice modification (slice2/PLMN2) or creation/instantiation of new slice at the target area (this may happen if a group of UEs are moving to the target area and the requested slice2 is missing in the target area).\n5.\tThe NSCE server may send the trigger action as a slice modification trigger request to the slice provisioning MnS producer at OAM/PLMN2 (e.g. slice modification for network slice) to extend slice availability to the target service area based on the expected/predicted VAL UE or VAL group mobility. As response to the trigger action, the provisioning MnS producer provides a slice modification trigger response with a positive or negative result.\n6.\tAfter the slice lifecycle change execution (based on the indication in step 5), the NSCE server sends a notification to the VAL server and optionally to the VAL client containing the positive or negative result from step5.\n7. \tIf big number of UEs is migrating from PLMN1 to PLMN2, there might be a need to further modify/reduce the respective slice resources of PLMN1. NSCE sends trigger request to the slice provisioning MnS producer at OAM/PLMN1 (e.g. slice modification for network slice) to decrease slice availability to the source area after the UEs have migrated.",

      "content": "5GS is required to provide suitable APIs to allow a trusted third-party to monitor the network slice used for the third-party according to operator policies. And network diagnostics is of key importance that helps with scanning, diagnosing and identifying problems within a network. Diagnostics includes gathering data and continuously providing sufficient fault diagnosis results that characterize the quality of the network connections and services. Exposure of relevant (and possibly aggregated) performance parameters ensures a quick reaction in case of failure as well as identifying network connectivity, performance and other related problems. Also, the alarm data from different sources (e.g., OAM, VAL server, NSCE client) can be used to help the third-party to diagnose the fault problem of the services, locate the fault causes, and to be aware of the potential fault. In TS 28.545 [23], the fault supervision management services are standardized by which the alarm of the network slice instance from network resource aspects can be subscribed and reported. This alarm information together with the application function's fault report and communication service related knowledge can be utilized by the NSCE to diagnose the cause of the service performance deterioration, locate the fault of the communication services, and expose the fault report to the third-party.\nFor example, if the status of the required communication is not correct, the SEAL/NSCE derives this alarm information from application functions. In this case, it is the SEAL/NSCE's responsibility to detect whether this fault is caused by the 5GS network or not and exposed the fault report to the third-party. If it is, then the SEAL/NSCE may inform the management functions the location of the fault and ask for the maintenance of the managed functions to clear the fault.\nThis service provides a possible procedure to illustrate the network slice fault management capability exposed by NSCE server. The performance data and alarm data from multiple sources is helpful to characterize the quality of the network connection.",

This request may be triggered by the errors of the applications detected by the VAL server itself, or the VAL server may periodically collect the fault diagnostic report subscribing to the NSCE.\n2.\tNSCE server sends the response of the subscription to VAL server.\n3.\tOptionally, on receiving the request from VAL server, NSCE server subscribes the performance data of network slice from 5GS. For OAM system, the APIs defined in clause 11.3, TS 28.532[7] is utilized. For CN functions, the APIs of Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo service defined in clause 7.3, TS 23.288[4] can be utilized.\nThe analytics data defined in clause 6.3 to clause 6.14, TS 23.288[4], network slice instance related performance data defined in clause 5, TS 28.552[19] and network analytics data in clause 8.3 and clause 8.4 TS 28.104[21] exposed by OAM system may be acquired. Also, the analytics result of slice-specific performance and slice usage analytics defined in TS 23.436[26] can be utilized.\n4.\tNSCE server subscribes the alarms of network slice instances from OAM system via the procedures defined in clause 6.1, TS 28.545[23], and the alarms are defined in clause 4.1.1.1, TS 32.111-1 [24], e.g., the fault of communication, environmental, equipment, processing error, QoS for device/resource/file/functionality/smallest.\n5.\tNSCE server may subscribe the alarm information (e.g., the 5GS network is not work or the required performance is under the threshold which leads the service's problem) collected by NSCE client if possible. The information collected by the NSCE client depends on the third-parties' requirements and implementation.\n6.\tNSCE client report the requested fault information to NSCE server.\nNote: The collection of fault data from NSCE client follows the mechanism defined in EVEX in SA4.\n7.\tEvery time the notifications from the OAM, NSCE client or ADAEs are received, NSCE server correlates this data, diagnoses the causes of the fault of the applications or services by analysing the fault information from different sources and prepares report for the VAL to be notified about the respective fault event. For example, the RAN function of the slice instance which is utilized to support the service of the smart grid application, for a certain time duration, the smart grid suffered the bad experience caused by Service Availability Failure Events, and in the RAN function is detected continuously to report an alarm of environmental fault in the same time duration, then the environment fault may be the root cause of the Service Availability Failure and should be prioritized to be solved. The fault may be identified with \"critical\", \"major\", \"minor\", \"ignore\" to show its prioritization.\n8.\tIf the NSCE server detects that the application/service error (reported from NSCE client) is caused by the 5GS, the VAL server may send the fault diagnosis report to OAM system to indicate the server fault which causes the application/service failure by utilizing the NSCE-OAM interface.\nNOTE:\tThe APIs utilized to send the fault diagnosis report to OAM will re-utilize the fault management services in TS 28.532[7] exposed by EGMF as defined in TS 28.533[25].\n9.\tNSCE server send a notification to VAL server with the fault diagnostics report prepared in step 7.",

To order a slice with certain slice requirements parameters and their values, the verticals will put their best effort into slice requirements translation. However, they are not able to guarantee that all the potential factors will be considered to generate the optimal slice requirements parameters on the first try.\nIn some cases, there may be some unforeseen exceptions (e.g., unexpected traffic changes) and the current configured slice requirements parameters are not able to fulfil the verticals requirements (e.g., more resources are required to address the exceptions), the VAL client may also suffer unsatisfied experience. Or in some other cases, when the service is executed on the required slice, the slice may not fully match the service real-time running conditions, for example, maybe only 60% of the slice resource is used to support the service, and rest of the slice resource is always idle, or the slice resource is insufficient due to under-provisioning.\nHence, NSCE is able to provide the capability of comparing the QoS achievement status together with the OAM QoS data versus real customer QoS data (e.g., Mean Opinion Score) collected from VAL client to check whether the existing QoS/Slice related data is able to satisfy the VAL clients and send periodically alignment notifications to VAL server for the slice requirements.",

NSCE service provider and slice owner can be different. For example the slice owner is VAL server, but the NSCE service provider is MNO.\nThis clause describes examples of deployment models with respect to different deployment scenarios as follows.\nA.1.2\tCentralized NSCE deployment\nFigure A.1.2 provides a example of centralized deployment of NSCE server whose service area covering the whole PLMN. It is also possible slice coverage area to be smaller than the NSCE service area.\nThe network slice capability enablement service is provided with the view of whole PLMN in this scenario.\nFigure A.1.2: Illustration of centralized NSCE deployment\nA.1.3\tDistributed NSCE deployment\nThe distributed deployment refers to the deployment model in which multiple NSCE servers are deployed by same provider, whose service area only covers some specific areas as shown below (based on geographical coordinates or TA list(s)).\nFigure A.1.3: Illustration of distributed NSCE deployment\nWhen there are multiple NSCE servers managed by same provider, NSCE server(s) can be subscribed for providing the network slice statistics to another NSCE server to provide a global view.\nThere can be two use cases to provide the NSCE service in the distributed deployment:\nOne use case is that the distributed deployed NSCE is about a slice service area which is equivalent to the edge/NPN’s service area. For this scenario, if the distributed deployed NSCE wants to access the NEF/NWDAF/NSACF services or to receive policies from OAM, it needs to interact to the global NSCE.\nA further use case could be that some NSCE services (e.g. MnS discovery) are locally provided to VAL servers (for example as a micro-service), whereas other capabilities are provided for the whole PLMN area. So, the distributed NSCE includes a subset of capabilities which are edge native. The local deployment of such capabilities can allow for more efficient services to the VAL servers (e.g. for QoS verification, the edge deployed NSCE can receive more timely KQI/QoE measurements and can process them locally before triggering an event).\nA.1.4\tNPN NSCE deployment\nThe NSCE architecture supports the deployment that NSCE server is deployed in NPN.\nFigure A.1.4 shows a deployment example of NSCE server deployment in the NPN. This case is valid if a geographical match between slice coverage area, NPN coverage area and NSCE service area is pre-configured. The matching may be pre-configured in the NSCE server by network operator based on the TA list or geographical coordinates. The NSCE server is deployed in Non-public network to provide the network slice capabilities exposure application service based on the interaction with NPN-5GC and NPN management system.\nFigure A.1.4: Illustration of NPN NSCE deployment\nA.1.5\tEdge NSCE deployment\nThe NSCE architecture supports the depolyment that the NSCE server is deployed in EDN as an EAS to provide the network slice capabilities exposure application service, based on the interaction with 5GS pertaining the network slice, and edge computing management system.\nFigure A.1.5 shows the edge NSCE deployment cases when the NSCE server is deployed in the EDN using LADNs as described in Annex A.2.4 of TS 23.558 [22]. This case is valid if a geographical match between slice coverage area, LADN service area (which is EDN service area) and NSCE service area is pre-configured in the NSCE server. The matching can based on the TA list or geographical coordinates.\nFigure A.1.5: Illustration of edge NSCE deployment\nA.2\tDeployment of NSCE server(s) in relation to VAL server and 3GPP system\nTo support the centralized/distributed deployment, the NSCE server(s) will have different deployment models and different relation with VAL server and 3GPP system.\nA.2.1\tCentralized NSCE deployment\nThe NSCE server can be deployed in single PLMN operator domain (as a SEAL server as specified in Figure 8.2.1-1 TS 23.434), deployed in VAL service provider domain by vertical (as a SEAL server as specified in Figure 8.2.2-1 TS 23.434), or deployed outside of both the VAL service provider domain and PLMN operator domain i.e. in 3rd party domain (as a SEAL server as specified in Figure 8.2.3-1 TS 23.434).\nThe deployment of NSCE server(s), with connections to 3GPP network systems in multiple PLMN operator domains (as a SEAL server as specified in Figure 8.2.2-2) is also supported. When the vertical consumer wants to get NSCE services in two countries which are operated by two different MNOs, the NSCE service provider has to interact with two 3GPP network systems. The NSCE server is either deployed in the VAL service provider domain or deployed separately in the 3rd party domain.\nA.2.2\tDistributed NSCE deployment\nThe NSCE servers can be distributed in multiple PLMN domains (as a SEAL server as specified in TS 23.434 Figure 8.2.1-2, Figure 8.2.1-3), or distributed in single PLMN operator domain (as a SEAL server as specified in TS 23.434 Figure 8.2.1-4). The NSCE servers can also distributed in VAL service provider domain by vertical (as a SEAL server as specified in TS 23.434 Figure 8.2.2-3), or distributed deployed in 3rd party domain by 3rd party. The VAL server can communicate with multiple NSCE servers via NSCE-S as long as other NSCE servers are discovered and accessible. Or, the VAL server can communicate with other NSCE servers via NSCE-E if needed.\nA.3\tDeployment of NSCE server(s) in relation to SEAL\nThe NSCE server(s) supports standalone deployment independent with other SEAL services, it can interact with other SEAL service(s) via SEAL-X interface as specified in Clause 6.2 TS 23.434, .\nThe NSCE service(s) supports combined deployment with other SEAL services, it can interact with other SEAL service via service API as specified in clause 15 TS 23.434.\nAnnex B (informative):Change history\nChange history\nDate\nMeeting\nTDoc\nCR\nRev\nCat\nSubject/Comment\nNew version\n2022-06\nSA6#49-bis-e\nTS skeleton\n0.0.0\n2022-07\nSA6#49-bis-e\nTS Skeleton agreed in SA6#49-bis-e: S6-221640,\nImplemented pCRs approved in SA6#49-bis-e: S6-221641, S6-221642, S6-221643, S6-221822, S6-221818.\n0.1.0\n2022-09\nSA6#50-e\nImplemented pCRs approved in SA6#50:\nS6-222146, S6-222197, S6-222407\nEditorial changes by the rapporteur.\n0.2.0\n2022-10\nSA6#51-e\nImplemented pCRs approved in SA6#51:\nS6-223036, S6-223035, S6-222901, S6-222764.\nEditorial changes by the rapporteur.\n0.3.0\n2022-11\nSA6#52\nImplemented pCRs approved in SA6#51:\nS6-223449, S6-223517, S6-223595, S6-223557, S6-223207, S6-223477\nEditorial changes by the rapporteur.\n0.4.0\n2023-01\nSA6#52-bis-e\nImplemented pCRs approved in SA6#52-bis-e:\nS6-230053, S6-230054, S6-230353, S6-230467, S6-230355, S6-230359, S6-230379, S6-230397, S6-230459, S6-230360, S6-230460, S6-230352, S6-230403, S6-230136, S6-230417, S6-230419, S6-230420, S6-230421, S6-230422, S6-230461\nEditorial changes by the rapporteur.\n0.5.0\n2023-03\nSA6#53\nImplemented pCRs approved in SA6#53:\nS6-230960, S6-230961, S6-230616, S6-231027, S6-231028, S6-230997, S6-231069, S6-230967, S6-231009, S6-230968, S6-230598Editorial changes by the rapporteur.\n0.6.0\n2023-03\nSA#99\nSP-230272\nPresentation for information at SA#99\n1.0.0\n2023-03\nSA#99\nSP-230346\nCorrection of implementation of pCR S6-231009 and presentation for information at SA#99\n1.1.0\n2023-04\nSA6#54\nImplemented pCRs approved in SA6#54:\nS6-231499, S6-231616, S6-231617, S6-231618, S6-231619, S6-231467, S6-231259, S6-231258, S6-231620, S6-231338, S6-231445, S6-231621\nEditorial changes by the rapporteur.\n1.2.0\n2023-05\nSA6#55\nImplemented pCRs approved in SA6#55:\nS6-232092, S6-231800, S6-231802, S6-231803, S6-232093, S6-231805, S6-231806, S6-232094, S6-232095, S6-232096.\nEditorial changes by the rapporteur.\n1.3.0\n2023-06\nSA#100\nSP-230686\nPresentation for approval at SA#100\n2.0.0\n2023-06\nSA#100\nSP-230686\nMCC Editorial update for publication after TSG SA approval (SA#100)\n18.0.0\n2023-12\nSA#102\nSP-231561\n0002\n2\nF\nSolve the EN in registration\n18.1.0\n2024-03\nSA#103\nSP-240307\n0007\n1\nF\nIE Name and Reference Corrections\n18.2.0\n2024-03\nSA#103\nSP-240307\n0008\n2\nF\nFault diagnosis subscription request\n18.2.0\n2024-03\nSA#103\nSP-240307\n0010\n3\nF\nAdd late notification to the network slice adaptation procedures\n18.2.0\n2024-03\nSA#103\nSP-240307\n0012\n2\nF\nCorrection of Area of interest\n18.2.0\n2024-06\nSA#104\nSP-240760\n0020\nF\nCorrection of Procedure name\n18.3.0\n2024-06\nSA#104\nSP-240760\n0023\n3\nF\nUpdate on predictive slice modification in Inter-PLMN based slice service continuity\n18.3.0\n2024-06\nSA#104\nSP-240760\n0025\n1\nF\nUE IP address preservation indicator deletion\n18.3.0\n2024-09\nSA#105\nSP-241215\n0029\n2\nF\nAdding a note on predictive slice modification in inter-PLMN based slice service continuity\n18.4.0",
