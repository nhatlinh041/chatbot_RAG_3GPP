Coupled with steadily increasing rates of international travel for business and leisure, this means a significant increase in the number of roaming users needing to be supported. This will lead to an increase of the signalling traffic on \"short -haul\" and \"long-haul\" international links.\nThe GLR (Gateway Location Register) is a node between the VLR and/or SGSN and the HLR, which may be used to optimise the location updating and the handling of subscriber profile data across network boundaries. When a subscriber is roaming the GLR plays the role of the HLR towards the VLR and SGSN in the visited network and the role of the VLR and SGSN towards the HLR in the home network.\nThe GLR is an optional entity within the VPLMN. The network architecture where the presence of a GLR within a UMTS PLMN is not visible to either a second generation HPLMN (i.e. GSM release 98 or earlier) or a 3G HPLMN (i.e. GSM Release 99 or later).",

The HLR takes some appropriate reaction (e.g. initiates service substitution or roaming restriction etc.) and determines whether to accept the location updating request or not for the user. The HLR generates a new profile (i.e. the profile after service substitution), which must be forwarded by the GLR to the VLR. The GLR must also maintain a copy of the actual service profile for the subscriber (i.e. the profile before service substitution).\nThe GLR will have to perform some transaction level processing on message 3 (i.e. Insert Subscriber Data ack) from the VLR.

Each step is explained in the following list.\nFigure 7.3/12: Inter SGSN Routeing Area Update Procedure\n1)\tThe MS sends a Routeing Area Update Request (old RAI, old P‑TMSI Signature, and Update Type) to the new SGSN. Update Type shall indicate RA update or periodic RA update. The BSS shall add the Cell Global Identity including the RAC and LAC of the cell where the message was received before passing the message to the SGSN.\n2)\tThe new SGSN sends SGSN Context Request (old RAI, TLLI, old P‑TMSI Signature, and New SGSN Address) to the old SGSN to get the MM and PDP contexts for the MS. The old SGSN validates the old P‑TMSI Signature and responds with an appropriate error cause if it does not match the value stored in the old SGSN. This should initiate the security functions in the new SGSN. If the security functions authenticate the MS correctly, the new SGSN shall send an SGSN Context Request (old RAI, TLLI, MS Validated, and New SGSN Address) message to the old SGSN. MS Validated indicates that the new SGSN has authenticated the MS. If the old P‑TMSI Signature was valid or if the new SGSN indicates that it has authenticated the MS, the old SGSN responds with SGSN Context Response (MM Context, PDP Contexts, and LLC Ack). If the MS is not known in the old SGSN, the old SGSN responds with an appropriate error cause. The old SGSN stores New SGSN Address, to allow the old SGSN to forward data packets to the new SGSN. LLC Ack contains the acknowledgements for each LLC connection used by the MS. Each PDP Context includes the GTP sequence number for the next downlink N‑PDU to be sent to the MS and the GTP sequence number for the next uplink N‑PDU to be tunnelled to the GGSN. The old SGSN starts a timer and stops the transmission of N-PDUs to the MS.\n3)\tSecurity functions may be executed. These procedures are defined in clause \"Security Function\". Ciphering mode shall be set if ciphering is supported.\n4)\tThe new SGSN sends an SGSN Context Acknowledge message to the old SGSN. This informs the old SGSN that the new SGSN is ready to receive data packets belonging to the activated PDP contexts. The old SGSN marks in its context that the MSC/VLR association and the information in the GGSNs and the GLR are invalid. This triggers the MSC/VLR, the GGSNs, and the GLR to be updated if the MS initiates a routeing area update procedure back to the old SGSN before completing the ongoing routeing area update procedure. If the security functions do not authenticate the MS correctly, then the routing area update shall be rejected, and the new SGSN shall send a reject indication to the old SGSN. The old SGSN shall continue as if the SGSN Context Request was never received.\n5)\tThe old SGSN duplicates the buffered N‑PDUs and starts tunnelling them to the new SGSN. Additional N‑PDUs received from the GGSN before the timer described in step 2 expires are also duplicated and tunnelled to the new SGSN. N‑PDUs that were already sent to the MS in acknowledged mode and that are not yet acknowledged by the MS are tunnelled together with the number of the LLC frame that transferred the last segment of the N‑PDU. No N‑PDUs shall be forwarded to the new SGSN after expiry of the timer described in step 2.\n6)\tThe new SGSN sends Update PDP Context Request (new SGSN Address, TID, and QoS Negotiated) to the GGSNs concerned. The GGSNs update their PDP context fields and return Update PDP Context Response (TID).\n7)\tThe new SGSN informs the GLR of the change of SGSN by sending Update Location (SGSN Number, SGSN Address, and IMSI) to the GLR.\n8)\tThe GLR sends Cancel Location (IMSI, Cancellation Type) to the old SGSN with Cancellation Type set to Update Procedure. If the timer described in step 2 is not running, then the old SGSN removes the MM and PDP contexts. Otherwise, the contexts are removed only when the timer expires. This allows the old SGSN to complete the forwarding of N‑PDUs. It also ensures that the MM and PDP contexts are kept in the old SGSN in case the MS initiates another inter SGSN routeing area update before completing the ongoing routeing area update to the new SGSN. The old SGSN acknowledges with Cancel Location Ack (IMSI).\n9)\tThe GLR sends Insert Subscriber Data (IMSI, GPRS subscription data) to the new SGSN. The new SGSN validates the MS's presence in the (new) RA. If due to regional subscription restrictions the MS is not allowed to be attached in the RA, the SGSN rejects the Routeing Area Update Request with an appropriate cause, and may return an Insert Subscriber Data Ack (IMSI, SGSN Area Restricted) message to the GLR. If all checks are successful then the SGSN constructs an MM context for the MS and returns an Insert Subscriber Data Ack (IMSI) message to the GLR.\n10)\tThe GLR acknowledges the Update Location by sending Update Location Ack (IMSI) to the new SGSN.\n11)\tThe new SGSN validates the MS's presence in the new RA. If due to roaming restrictions the MS is not allowed to be attached in the SGSN, or if subscription checking fails, then the new SGSN rejects the routeing area update with an appropriate cause. If all checks are successful then the new SGSN constructs MM and PDP contexts for the MS. A logical link is established between the new SGSN and the MS. The new SGSN responds to the MS with Routeing Area Update Accept (P‑TMSI, LLC Ack, and P‑TMSI Signature). LLC Ack contains the acknowledgements for each LLC connection used by the MS, thereby confirming all mobile-originated N‑PDUs successfully transferred before the start of the update procedure.\n12)\tThe MS acknowledges the new P‑TMSI with a Routeing Area Update Complete (P‑TMSI, LLC Ack). LLC Ack contains the acknowledgements for each LLC connection used by the MS, thereby confirming all mobile-terminated N‑PDUs successfully transferred before the start of the update procedure. If LLC Ack confirms reception of N‑PDUs that were forwarded from the old SGSN, then these N‑PDUs shall be discarded by the new SGSN. LLC and SNDCP in the MS are reset.\nIn the case of a rejected routeing area update operation, due to regional subscription or roaming restrictions, the new SGSN shall not construct an MM context.

Cause indicates the reason why the PDP context could not be established:\n-\t'IMSI Not Known'. The SGSN has no MM context for that IMSI (Cause in PDU Notification Response).\n-\t'MS GPRS Detached'. The MM state of the MS is IDLE (Cause in PDU Notification Response).\n-\t'MS Not GPRS Responding'. The MS is GPRS-attached to the SGSN but the MS does not respond. This may be due to:\n-\tthe lack of a response to a GPRS Paging Request;\n-\tan Abnormal RLC condition, or\n-\tno Activate PDP Context Request message received within a certain time after the Request PDP Context Activation message was delivered to the MS (Cause in PDU Notification Reject Request).\n-\t'MS Refuses'. The MS refuses explicitly the network-requested PDP context (Cause in PDU Notification Reject Request).\nWhen receiving the PDU Notification Response or the PDU Notification Reject Request message the GGSN may reject or discard the PDP PDU depending on the PDP type.\nAfter an unsuccessful Network-Requested PDP Context Activation procedure the network may perform some actions to prevent unnecessary enquires to the HLR. The actions taken depend on the cause of the delivery failure.\n-\tIf the MS is not reachable or if the MS refuses the PDP PDU (Cause value 'MS Not GPRS Responding' or 'MS Refuses'), then the SGSN shall not change the setting of MNRG for this MS.

The GGSN may store the SGSN address during a certain period and send subsequent PDU Notification Request messages to that SGSN via IM-GSN.\n-\tIf the MS is GPRS-detached or if the IMSI is not known in the SGSN (Cause value 'MS GPRS Detached' or 'IMSI Not Known'), then the SGSN, the GGSN, and the HLR may perform the Protection and Mobile User Activity procedures.\nThe Protection procedure is illustrated in Figure 7.3/16. Each step is explained in the following list.\nFigure 7.3/16: Protection Procedure\n1)\tIf the MM context of the mobile is IDLE or if the SGSN has no information about that user, the SGSN returns a PDU Notification Response (Cause) message to the GGSN via IM-GSN with Cause equal to 'MS GPRS Detached' or 'IMSI Not Known', otherwise the Cause shall be 'Activation Proceeds'. If the Cause is 'MS GPRS Detached' or 'IMSI Not Known' and if the SGSN has an MM context for that user, the SGSN sets MNRG to indicate the need to report to the HLR when the next contact with that MS is performed.\n2)\tIf the MS does not respond or refuses the activation request, the SGSN sends a PDU Notification Reject Request (IMSI, PDP Type, PDP Address, Cause) message to the GGSN via IM-GSN with Cause equal to 'MS Not GPRS Responding' or 'MS Refuses'. The GGSN returns a PDU Notification Reject Response message to the SGSN via IM-GSN.\n3)\tIf Cause equals 'IMSI Not Known' the IM-GSN may send a Send Routeing Information for GPRS (IMSI) message to the GLR before sending the PDP Notification response to GGSN. The GLR returns a Send Routeing Information for GPRS Ack (IMSI, SGSN Address, and Cause) message to the IM-GSN indicating the address of the SGSN that currently serves the MS. If SGSN Address is different from the one previously stored by the IM-GSN, then steps 3, 4, and 5 in Figure 6 are followed.If Cause equals 'IMSI Not Known' the GGSN may send a Send Routeing Information for GPRS (IMSI) message to the HLR. The HLR returns a Send Routeing Information for GPRS Ack (IMSI, SGSN Address, Cause) message to the GGSN (Note that the SGSN Address parameter includes actually the value of the IM-GSN Address.) indicating the address of the IM-GSN that currently serves the MS. If IM-GSN Address is different from the one previously stored by the GGSN, then steps 3, 4, and 5 in Figure 6 are followed.\n4)\tIf SGSN Address is the same as the one previously stored in the IM-GSN or if the Cause value returned in step 1 equals 'MS GPRS Detached', then the IM-GSN sets MNRG for that PDP address and sends a Failure Report (IMSI) message to the GLR to request MNRG to be set in the GLR. The GLR sets (if not already set) MNRG for the IMSI. Note that GLR does not store IM-GSN address and IM-GSN address to report to when activity from that IMSI is detected, and IM-GSN forgets the SGSN address after receiving PDU notification response or sending PDU notification reject response.\nIf IM-GSN Address is the same as the one previously stored in the GGSN, or if the Cause value returned in step 1 equals 'MS GPRS Detached', then the GGSN sets MNRG for that PDP address and sends a Failure Report (IMSI, GGSN Number, GGSN Address) message to the HLR to request MNRG to be set in the HLR. The HLR sets (if not already set) MNRG for the IMSI and adds GGSN Number and GGSN Address to the list of GGSNs to report to when activity from that IMSI is detected. GGSN Number is either the number of the GGSN, or, if a protocol converting GSN is used as an intermediate node, the number of the protocol-converting GSN. GGSN Address is an optional parameter that shall be included if a protocol-converting GSN is used.\nThe Mobile User Activity procedure is illustrated in Figure 7.3/17.

In addition, the GLR sets the MSC area restricted flag or the SGSN area restricted flag \"True\". Also, the HLR sets the MSC area restricted flag or the SGSN area restricted flag \"True\", and the location updating for the IMSI is rejected.

If the IMSI record in main memory is lost or broken by restart, it is retrieved from non-volatile backup memory as in HLR. This backup data would contain enough information to send \"Provide Roaming Number\" message to the VLR when it is requested by the HLR. The data which shall be stored in backed-up would be \"VLR number\", \"SGSN number\", \"IMSI\".\nIn case of GLR restart, it sends \"Reset\" message including the GLR number as the HLR number to VLR/SGSN where one or more of its mobile terminals are registered to prompt location updating attempt from VLR/SGSN. On receiving the location updating request, the GLR relays it to the HLR to restore its location and subscriber data. The restoration trigger can be the normal location updating from mobile terminal, call origination and call termination and so on.\nThe assumption in the case of terminating call in circuit switched service is that GLR would have VLR number in non-volatile memory so that it could know the exact VLR mobile terminal registered. If GLR loses VLR number or has only old VLR number, it loses the opportunity to restore its data at the timing of terminating call. This situation is the same as the case of HLR that loses VLR number after restart.\nAlso in this case, GLR shall have an indicator representing restart of GLR. This indicator is set \"Not Confirmed\" when GLR restarts, and kept the status until subscriber profile is successfully downloaded from HLR. This shall be triggered by radio contact of the mobile terminal.\nThe restoration indicator is called the \"Location and Subscriber information Confirmed by HLR\" (LSIC) and defined as follows:\nIf the LSIC is set to \"Not confirmed,\" the GLR send Update Location message to HLR.\n\"Location and Subscriber information confirmed by HLR\" is set to \"Not Confirmed\" at any of following events:\n-\tThe GLR receives an \"Update Location\" request for an MS for which the GLR has no IMSI records.\n-\tThe GLR receives a \"Reset\" message from the HLR with which the MS is registered.\n-\tThe GLR detects the restart of itself and the IMSI record does not seem to be guaranteed (e.g. data retrieved from backup non-volatile memory).\n\"Location and Subscriber information confirmed by HLR\" is set to \"Confirmed\" at any of following events:\n-\tThe GLR successfully performs an \"Update Location\" to the HLR.\nThe recovery procedure of GLR Failure is illustrated in Figure 7.6/1.

After identifying access to the user and successful authentication the VLR or SGSN sends Restore data message to the GLR.

If the HLR included an HLR-ID list in the reset message, then only those subscriber records for which the leading digits of the IMSI match one of the HLR-IDs in the HLR-ID list will be marked.\nThen the GLR sends a RESET message, which includes the GLR number as the HLR number and HLR-ID list if the GLR received it from the HLR, to the serving node (i.e. VLR or SGSN).

The error indications which the GLR or IM-MSC may receive from the MSC, SGSN, VLR or MS enable the GLR or IM-MSC to return one of the error indications given in Table 23.040/1 back to the SMS-GMSC.\nNote that the SMS-GMSC shall regard the GLR as a SGSN and the IM-MSC a MSC and it is not aware the GLR and the IM-MSC as individual entities.\nOperation 2: ObtainMSCNumber.\nWhen the IM-MSC receives \"1a.

Thus, the outcome of the operation comprises either success, i.e. that the message has been delivered to the MS; or a failure that may be caused by several reasons, e.g. failure in the transfer IM-MSC ‑> MSC or GLR -> SGSN, MS being detached, or no paging response.\nNote that the MSC and the SGSN shall not be aware of existence of the GLR and the IM-MSC.\nOperation 4: InformSMDeliveryFailure.\nWhen the IM-MSC receives \"3c. FailureReport\" with absent subscriber cause, IM-MSC informs it to the GLR. The GLR checks if the reason of absent subscriber is due to the purged MS in the serving node (i.e. MSC or SGSN).
