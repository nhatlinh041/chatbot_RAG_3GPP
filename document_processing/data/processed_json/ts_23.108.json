The network may optionally instruct the MS to attach the user connection at this stage of the call, by means of the progress indicator information element set to the value #1 or #8 (if the ringing tone will be sent by the remote end) in the ALERTING message. In that case, an alerting ringing tone has to be generated by the network.\nNOTE:\tThe speech codec is transparent for supervisory tones.\nA CONNECT message and its acknowledgement CONNECT ACKNOWLEDGE complete the call establishment when the called party has answered.\nThe mobile originating call setup with early assignment is shown in figure 7.10a/3GPP TS 23.108.\nb)\tOACSU option (late assignment):\nThe network determines when the traffic channel is to be assigned. The assignment may be performed at any time after call establishment has been initiated in the fixed network. In the following the case is considered where the network will only allocate a traffic channel after the called party has answered the call (late assignment).\nAs in a) an ALERTING message is sent to the mobile station when user alerting has been initiated at the called side. If the ringing tone is needed, it has to be generated locally at the mobile station as no traffic channel is allocated. When the called party has answered, the network will initiate the channel assignment procedure in order to allocate a traffic channel to the mobile station. If call queuing is applied, it may cause variable delay in the traffic channel assignment. Once the channel assignment has been completed the network will send a CONNECT message to the mobile station. The MS attaches then the user connection. The CONNECT ACKNOWLEDGE message will complete the call setup.\nThe mobile originating call setup with late assignment is shown in figure 7.10b/3GPP TS 23.108.\nc)\tVery early assignment:\nThe network assigns the traffic channel at the earliest possible moment, i.e. in the immediate assignment procedure. The mode of the traffic channel is changed from signalling only to the mode necessary for the call by means of the channel mode change procedure.

applied.\nThe further establishment of the call is as in a).\nThe mobile originating call setup with very early assignment is shown in figure 7.10c/3GPP TS 23.108.\nß\nMobile Station

      "content": "Mobile terminating call establishment is initiated by the network sending a PAGING REQUEST message (see figure 7.11a/3GPP TS 23.108). Upon receiving this message the mobile station initiates the immediate assignment procedure and responds to the network by sending the PAGING RESPONSE message within a layer 2 SABM frame. The network returns a layer 2 UA frame containing the same information field as was sent in the SABM frame.\nAuthentication and ciphering are treated by the network in the same way as defined for the mobile originating call establishment (subclause 7.3.2). After ciphering has been started, the network sends a SETUP message to the mobile station. The capability of the mobile station (at that time) to accept the call is confirmed when the mobile station returns a CALL CONFIRMED message to the network.\na)\tNon-OACSU option (early assignment):\nWith this option the network initiates the assignment of a traffic channel upon receiving the CALL CONFIRMED message.\nThe signal IE is not included in the SETUP message, therefore user alerting is initiated only after a traffic channel has been allocated. An ALERTING message will be sent to the network.\nWhen the called user answers, the mobile station sends a CONNECT message to the network. Upon receiving the CONNECT message the network completes the through connection of the communication path and sends a CONNECT ACK message to the mobile station.\nb)\tOACSU option (late assignment):\nIn that option, the signalling IE is included in the SETUP message. Consequently, user alerting is initiated as soon as the MS has accepted the call.\nThe network determines when the traffic channel is to be assigned. The assignment may be performed at any time after user alerting has been initiated. In the following the case is considered where the network will only allocate a traffic channel to the mobile station after having received the CONNECT message sent from the mobile station (see figure 7.11b).\nUpon receiving the ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE message from the mobile station, the network completes the through connection of the communication path and sends a CONNECT ACKNOWLEDGE message to the mobile station.\nMobile Station              Network\n+-                               -+\n│          PAGING  REQUEST        │\n│    <-------------------------   │\n│          CHANNEL REQUEST        │  RR connection\n│    ------------------------->   │  establishment\n│      IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT       │  (MT)\n│    <------------------------    │\n+-                               -+\n+-                               -+\n│          PAGING RESPONSE        │\n│    ------------------------->   │  Service request\n+-                               -+\n+-                               -+\n│      AUTHENTICATION REQUEST     │  Authentication\n│    <-------------------------   │\n│      AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE    │\n│    -------------------------->  │\n+-                               -+\n+-                               -+\n│       CIPHer MODe COMMAND       │\n│    <-------------------------   │  Ciphering\n│       CIPHER MODE COMPLETE      │  mode setting\n│    -------------------------->  │\n+-                               -+\n+-                               -+\n│               SETUP             │\n│    <--------------------------  │  Call initiation\n│           CALL CONFIRMED        │\n│    -------------------------->  │\n+-                               -+\n+-                               -+\n│        ASSIGNMENT COMMAND       │\n│    <--------------------------  │  Assignment of\n│        ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE      │  a traffic\n│    -------------------------->  │  channel\n+-                               -+\n+-                               -+\n│              ALERTING           │\n│     ------------------------->  │  User alerting\n+-                               -+  information\n+-                               -+\n│              CONNECT            │\n│    -------------------------->  │  Call accepted\n│        CONNECT ACKNOWLEDGE      │\n│    <--------------------------  │\n+-                               -+\nFigure 7.11a/3GPP TS 23.108: Mobile terminating: call establishment without OACSU (early assignment)\nMobile Station              Network\n+-                               -+\n│          PAGING  REQUEST        │\n│    <-------------------------   │\n│          CHANNEL REQUEST        │  RR connection\n│    ------------------------->   │  establishment\n│      IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT       │  (MT)\n│    <------------------------    │\n+-                               -+\n+-                               -+\n│          PAGING RESPONSE        │\n│    ------------------------->   │  Service request\n+-                               -+\n+-                               -+\n│      AUTHENTICATION REQUEST     │  Authentication\n│    <-------------------------   │\n│      AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE    │\n│    -------------------------->  │\n+-                               -+\n+-                               -+\n│       CIPHer MODe COMMAND       │\n│    <-------------------------   │  Ciphering\n│       CIPHER MODE COMPLETE      │  mode setting\n│    -------------------------->  │\n+-                               -+\n+-                               -+\n│               SETUP             │\n│    <--------------------------  │  Call initiation\n│           CALL CONFIRMED        │\n│    -------------------------->  │\n+-                               -+\n+-                               -+\n│              ALERTING           │\n│     ------------------------->  │  User alerting\n+-                               -+  information\n+-                               -+\n│              CONNECT            │\n│     ------------------------->  │\n+-                               -+\n+-                               -+\n│        ASSIGNMENT COMMAND       │\n│    <--------------------------  │  Assignment of\n│        ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE      │  a traffic\n│    -------------------------->  │  channel\n+-                               -+\n+-                               -+\n│        CONNECT ACKNOWLEDGE      │\n│    <--------------------------  │\n+-                               -+\nFigure 7.11b/3GPP TS 23.108: Mobile terminating: call establishment with OACSU (late assignment)",

      "content": "Network initiated mobile originating call establishment (which is used, for example, for CCBS Service) is initiated by the network sending a PAGING REQUEST message. Upon receiving this message the mobile station initiates the immediate assignment procedure and responds to the network by sending the PAGING RESPONSE message within a layer 2 SABM frame. The network returns a layer 2 UA frame containing the same information field as was sent in the SABM frame.\nAuthentication and ciphering are treated by the network in the same way as defined for the mobile originating call establishment (subclause 7.3.2). After ciphering has been started, the network sends a CM SERVICE PROMPT message, indicating that the CM protocol is to be started, to the mobile station. The basic capability of the mobile station to accept any form of recall service is confirmed when the mobile station returns a START CC message to the network.\na)\tassignment before A party alerting:\nWith this option the network allocates a traffic channel to the mobile station before the mobile station alerts its user.\nThe network responds to the START CC message with a CC-ESTABLISHMENT message. The MS answers with a CC-ESTABLISHMENT CONFIRMED message indicating the wanted channel characteristics. The network then initiates traffic channel assignment.\nWhen the traffic channel has been assigned, the network indicates a pending recall by sending a RECALL message.\nIf the calling user accepts the recall, a SETUP message is sent to the network. The network responds with a CALL PROCEEDING message and initiates call establishment in the fixed network.\nWhen user alerting has been initiated at the called side, an ALERTING message is sent to the mobile station. The network may optionally instruct the MS to attach the user connection at this stage of the call, by means of the progress indicator information element set to the value #1 or #8(if the ringing tone will be sent by the remote end) in the ALERTING message. In that case, an alerting ringing tone has to be generated by the network.\nNOTE 1:\tThe speech codec is transparent for supervisory tones.\nA CONNECT message and its acknowledgement CONNECT ACKNOWLEDGE complete the call establishment when the called party has answered.\nThe network initiated mobile originating call establishment with assignment before A part alerting is shown in figure 7.19/3GPP TS 23.108.\nb)\tassignment before B party alerting:\nWith this option the network allocates a traffic channel to the mobile station after the mobile station has alerted its user and after its user has accepted the recall but before the network initiates call establishment in the fixed network.\nThe network responds to the START CC message with a CC-ESTABLISHMENT message. The MS answers with a CC-ESTABLISHMENT CONFIRMED message indicating the wanted channel characteristics.\nThe network indicates a pending recall by sending a RECALL message. If the calling user accepts the recall, a SETUP message is sent to the network. The network responds with a CALL PROCEEDING message and initiates traffic channel assignment.\nWhen the traffic channel has been assigned, the network initiates call establishment in the fixed network.\nWhen user alerting has been initiated at the called side, an ALERTING message is sent to the mobile station. The network may optionally instruct the MS to attach the user connection at this stage of the call, by means of the progress indicator information element set to the value #1 or #8(if the ringing tone will be sent by the remote end) in the ALERTING message. In that case, an alerting ringing tone has to be generated by the network.\nNOTE 2:\tThe speech codec is transparent for supervisory tones.\nA CONNECT message and its acknowledgement CONNECT ACKNOWLEDGE complete the call establishment when the called party has answered.\nThe network initiated mobile originating call establishment with assignment before B party alerting is shown in figure 7.20/3GPP TS 23.108.\nc)\tassignment after A and B party alerting\nWith this option, the network determines when the traffic channel is to be assigned. The assignment may be performed at any time after call establishment has been initiated in the fixed network. In the following, the case is considered where the network will only allocate a traffic channel after the called party has answered the call (late assignment).\nThe network responds to the START CC message with a CC-ESTABLISHMENT. The MS answers with a CC-ESTABLISHMENT CONFIRMED message indicating the wanted channel characteristics.\nThe network indicates a pending recall by sending a RECALL message. If the calling user accepts the recall, a SETUP message is sent to the network. The network responds with a CALL PROCEEDING message and initiates call establishment in the fixed network.\nAs in a) and b) an ALERTING message is sent to the mobile station when user alerting has been initiated at the called side. If the ringing tone is needed, it has to be generated locally at the mobile station as no traffic channel is allocated. When the called party has answered, the network will initiate the channel assignment procedure in order to allocate a traffic channel to the mobile station. Once the channel assignment has been completed the network will send a CONNECT message to the mobile station. The MS attaches then the user connection. The CONNECT ACKNOWLEDGE message will complete the call setup.\nThe network initiated mobile originating call establishment with assignment after A and B party alerting is shown in figure 7.21/3GPP TS
