      "content": "This specification covers UAV functionality provided by 5GC connected to NG-RAN and EPC connected to LTE.\nThe following functionality is defined for UAV support in the 3GPP system:\n-\tAn UAV is authenticated and authorized by USS via a USS UAV Authentication & Authorization (UUAA) with the support of the 3GPP system before connectivity for UAS services is enabled.\n-\tDepending on 3GPP network operator and/or regulatory requirements, the UUAA is performed:\n-\tIn 5GS: either as a separate procedure during the 5GS registration procedure (optional and based on specific PLMN policies, USS requirements, and geographic regulatory requirements), or when the UAV requests user plane resources for UAV operation (i.e. PDU session establishment). The UAV shall support UUAA during Registration and PDU session establishment procedure. The network shall support UUAA during PDU session establishment.\n-\tIn EPS: during the attach procedure and the corresponding PDN connection establishment. The network shall support UUAA during PDN connection establishment. The UAV shall support UUAA during PDN connection establishment procedure.\n-\tA UAV that is provisioned with a CAA-Level UAV ID shall provide the CAA-Level UAV ID in 5GS in both Registration and in PDU Session establishment. In EPC, a UAV that is provisioned with a CAA-Level UAV ID provides the CAA-Level UAV ID in PDN Connection establishment in SM-PCO. The CN determine whether UUAA is executed at 5GS registration or at PDU session/PDN Connection establishment, based on local policies.\n-\tThe UUAA is performed at PDU session establishment when the UAV requests user plane resources for UAV operation and the UAV provides its CAA Level ID during PDU session (PDN connection) establishment.\n-\tThe UAV flight authorization and UAV-UAVC pairing authorization is performed at PDU session/PDN connection establishment/modification procedures.\n-\tThe 3GPP system supports USS authorization of pairing between a UAV and a networked UAVC or a UAVC that connects to the UAV via Internet connectivity during either the establishment of the PDN connection/PDU session for C2 communication or a modification of a PDN connection/PDU session either dedicated to C2 communication or common to USS communication and C2 communication. Modifications of the pairing or re-authorization take place via modification of the established PDN connection/PDU session. During such procedures, the USS provides to the 3GPP system information (e.g. QoS requirement, data flow descriptors, etc.) that enable traffic between the UAV and the UAVC.\nNOTE 1:\tHow the USS is made aware of the UAVC is outside the scope of 3GPP in this Release.\n-\tFor EPC, the PDN connections used by UAV are served by SMF+PGW-C regardless of whether the UAV support 5G NAS or whether their subscription allows access to 5GC. The APN(s) used by the UAV for contacting USS or for C2 communication always resolves to a SMF+PWG-C.\nThe following architectural assumptions apply:\n-\tIt is assumed that the UAV trying to access UAS services using 3GPP connectivity is already registered with a USS and has been assigned a CAA-Level-UAV ID. The procedure for UAV registration and assignment of CAA-Level-UAV ID is out of scope of 3GPP. The USS assigns to the UAV a CAA-Level UAV ID, or is made aware of the assigned CAA-Level UAV ID.\n-\tA UAV is associated with an Aerial subscription in the UDM. The Aerial subscription contains aerial UE indication in the Access and Mobility Subscription data (to be used similarly to aerial UE indication defined in EPS), an aerial service indication in the Session Management Subscription data for each DNN dedicated for UAS services (C2 and UUAA-SM) which indicates that corresponding authentication/authorization has to be done using API based mechanism.\n-\tAn UAV is identified by USS using a CAA-level UAV ID, and identified by the 3GPP System using a 3GPP UAV ID assigned by the MNO:\n-\tIt is assumed that an aerial subscription associated to a UAV includes at least one GPSI to be used as 3GPP UAV ID.\n-\tA UAV is registered with the USS either before connecting with the 3GPP system or using plain internet connectivity via the 3GPP system. Before registering for UAS services with the 3GPP system, the UAV shall be provisioned with a CAA-Level UAV Identity.\n-\tIn roaming scenarios, it is assumed that access to USS is in the VPLMN, thus packet data connectivity for UAV-USS communication is in local breakout, and the UAS NF function is located in the VPLMN.\n-\tIn this Release, the UAV uses 3GPP access (i.e. LTE & NR) for 3GPP UAV related operations.\n-\tActivation of RAN aerial features for UAV accessing via E-UTRA reuses the existing mechanism defined in TS 36.300 [7].\nNOTE 2:\tIn this Release, an UAV is served by single USS for the duration of the connectivity between the USS and the UAV.\n-\tOne or more USS(s) may be present in a specific region and may manage UAVs over one or more 3GPP networks.\n-\tThe 3GPP Network subscription for the UAV is not assumed to contain any information about the USS.\n-\tThe USS address, if known to the UAV, is configured in the UAV via mechanisms outside the scope of 3GPP.\n-\tFor PC5, Release 15 (and later) version of the specification is the baseline.\nNOTE 3:\tIn this Release, UAV UE uses A2X capability to support the PC5 based DAA and BRID.",

No CAA-level UAV ID is assigned to and used by a UAVC.\nVarious formats of CAA-level UAV ID must be supported by the UAV to support various geo-specific regulations. At least Serial Number Identification, a CAA-Issued Registration Identifier (aka Session ID), and USS Issued UUID shall be supported.\nIn the case of Session ID, though the actual format of the CAA-Level UAV ID is defined outside 3GPP and is not decided by 3GPP, it is assumed that the CAA-Level UAV ID used for Remote Identification contains at least the following information:\n-\tan identity unique to the UAV, which may preferably have temporary validity: this identifies uniquely the UAV with the entity that allocates the CAA-level UAV ID.\nNOTE 1:\tWhether privacy or confidentiality requirements will apply to the unique UAV temporary identity depends on regulations in various regions.\n-\tCAA-level UAV ID Routing Information, used by an entity attempting to retrieve the UAV data (e.g. TPAE) to identify and address the appropriate UAS NF/NEF where to send the query.

When the UAV registers with the USS before registering to a 3GPP system for UAS services, the UAV operator provides information about the serving PLMN to the USS. In order to allocate a CAA-Level UAV ID, the USS interacts with a UAS NF if 3GPP Assisted CAA-Level UAV ID Assignment is desired. The 3GPP network selects a UAS NF to respond to the USS, and the UAS NF provides to the USS the CAA-Level Routing Information to enable a resolver of the CAA-level UAV ID to resolve to the UAS NF.\n-\tThe USS delegates to the UAS NF the role of \"resolver\" of the CAA-Level UAV ID and return to an entity (e.g. the TPAE) querying information about the UAV based on the CAA-Level UAV ID the UAV data that the UAS NF retrieves from the USS.\n-\tIt is assumed that the mapping between USS assigned CAA-level UAV ID and the associated 3GPP UAV ID is known by the UAS NF after the UAV is authorized by the USS via a successful UUAA. If UAS NF receives a remote identification and tracking query from a TPAE with the USS-assigned CAA-Level UAV ID, the UAS NF uses the mapped 3GPP UAV ID to coordinate with different 3GPP functions to collect the UAV remote identification and tracking information. In addition, the UAS NF can retrieve aviation-level information (e.g. pilot information, USS operator, etc.) from the USS to provide it to the querying party (e.g. TPAE).\nNOTE 2:\tIt is assumed that the UAV is not aware of which assignment mechanisms is used for the CAA-Level UAV ID.",

      "content": "The UUAA-MM procedure is optional and triggered for a UE that requires UAV authentication and authorization by a USS when registering with 5GS. The UUAA-MM procedure is triggered by the AMF. UUAA-MM is triggered during the UE Registration based on the local network policy, if the UE has an Aerial UE subscription with the 5GS and if the UE has provided the CAA-Level UAV ID of the UAV in the Registration Request, or when the USS that authenticated the UAV triggers a re-authentication.\nThe UE is authenticated and authorized by USS using a CAA-Level UAV ID and credentials associated to the CAA-Level UAV ID, different from the 3GPP subscription credentials (e.g. SUPI and credentials used for PLMN access). During UUAA-MM procedure, the AMF communicates with the USS via a UAS NF and forwards authentication messages transparently between the UE and UAS NF.\nUAS NF stores the UAV UEs UUAA context after successful UUAA procedure. The UUAA context may be stored in the UDSF or may be stored locally in the UAS NF depending on deployments. The UAS NF shall also create an implicit subscription for notification towards the AMF after the successful UUAA procedure. This notification is used by the UAS NF to trigger re-authentication, update authorization data or revoke authorization of the UAV, upon receipt of such request from the USS.\nFigure 5.2.2.1-1: UUAA in the context of the Registration procedure (UUAA-MM)\n1.\tThe UE sends a Registration request message and, if configured with one, it shall provide a CAA-level UAV ID of the UAV and optionally a USS address when registering for UAS services.\n2.\tIf primary authentication is required (e.g. if this is an initial Registration), AMF invokes it as described in step 9 in Figure 4.2.2.2.2-1 of TS 23.502 [3]. Subsequently AMF retrieves UE subscription data from UDM as described in step 14 in Figure 4.2.2.2.2-1 of TS 23.502 [3] - (not shown in the figure).\n3.\tAMF shall determine whether UUAA-MM is required for the UAV. The AMF decides that UUAA is required if:\na)\tthe UE has a valid Aerial UE subscription information;\nb)\tUUAA is to be performed during Registration according to local operator policy;\nc)\tthere is no successful UUAA result from a previous UUAA-MM procedure;\nd)\tthe UE has provided a CAA-Level UAV ID.\nAMF shall not perform UUAA-MM for non-3GPP access and shall ensure that the UE is not allowed to access any aerial services in non-3GPP access by rejecting PDU session establishment requests for aerial services (identified by DNN/S-NSSAI).\n4.\tIf AMF determines in step 3 that a UUAA-MM is to be performed, AMF shall include a pending UUAA-MM indication in the Registration Accept message. The AMF stores in the UE context that a UUAA is pending. The UE shall wait for completion of the UUAA-MM procedure without attempting to register for UAS services or to establish user plane connectivity to USS or UAV-C.\nIf AMF determines that UUAA is not to be performed during this Registration procedure, UUAA may be triggered during PDU Session Establishment later on.\nIf UUAA is configured in the AMF to be performed during 5GS registration and the UE has provided a CAA-Level UAV ID in the registration request in step 1, but the UE does not have an aerial subscription in the UE subscription data retrieved from the UDM in step 2, then the AMF rejects the registration with an indication informing no aerial subscription. This information indicates to the UAV of the reason for the rejection for aerial services and ensures that the UE is not allowed to access any aerial service.\nIf UAS services become enabled or disabled (e.g. because the aerial subscription becomes a part of the UE subscription data retrieved from UDM as described in clause 5.2.3.3.1 of TS 23.502 [3]) then AMF may trigger a UE Configuration Update procedure as described in clauses 4.5.1 and 4.2.4.2 of TS 23.502 [3] to notify the UE. The UE may initiate a mobility registration update procedure to get the UAS services after completion of the UE Configuration Update procedure.\nIf UUAA is configured in the AMF to be performed during 5GS registration, the UE did not provide a CAA-Level UAV ID in the registration request in step 1, but UE has aerial subscription in the UE subscription data retrieved from UDM in step 2, then the AMF accepts the registration and ensures that the UE is not allowed to access any aerial service by storing in the UE context that 'UUAA-MM has FAILED', and further rejecting PDU session establishment requests for aerial services (identified by DNN/S-NSSAI). At a later point in time, if the UE wants to use the aerial services by providing the CAA Level UAV ID later on via UUAA-MM procedure, then the UE shall first perform Mobility Registration Update as explained in clause 4.2.2.2.2 of TS 23.502 [3].\n5.\tIf UE indicates its support for Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization (NSSAA) procedure in the UE MM Core Network Capability, and if the UE includes Requested S-NSSAI in Registration Request which is subject to NSSAA, however, the Requested S-NSSAI has not been successfully authenticated, the NSSAA procedure is executed as described in clause 4.2.2.2.2 of TS 23.502 [3].\n6.\tIf required based on step 3 determination, and if the S-NSSAI that is associated with the UAS services is part of the Allowed NSSAI, UUAA-MM procedure (see clause 5.2.2.2) is executed at this step. Once the UUAA-MM procedure is successfully completed for the UAV, the AMF stores a successful UUAA result and updates the UE context indicating that UUAA is no longer pending and the authorized CAA-Level UAV ID if provided by the USS. The USS may provide a new CAA-Level UAV ID as the authorized CAA-Level UAV ID. The AMF shall trigger a UE Configuration Update procedure (see TS 23.502 [3], clause 4.2.4.2) to deliver the UUAA result, the UUAA Authorization Payload containing UAV configuration and the authorized CAA-Level UAV ID if received from the USS to the UE.\nNOTE 1:\tThe UAV configuration is application layer information outside the scope of 3GPP.\nIf UUAA fails, based on local network policy, the AMF may decide to de-register the UE with an appropriate cause value in the De-Registration Request message, or keep the UE-registered with a failure UUAA result in UE context as described in step 7 of clause 5.2.2.2 and ensures that the UE is not allowed to access any aerial service based on the DNN/S-NSSAI value. If the UE is de-registered, the UE may re-attempt to re-register without including the CAA-level UAV ID.\nNOTE 2:\tThe security aspects for this procedure is defined in TS 33.256 [10].",

If the SMF receives the DN authorized Session AMBR in from the UAS NF/NEF, it sends the DN authorized Session AMBR within the Session AMBR to the PCF to retrieve the authorized Session AMBR (described in clause 6.4 of TS 23.503 [9]).\nThe SMF transfers the Authentication/Authorization result, the Service Level Device Identity containing the authorized CAA-Level UAV ID and the Authorization Data (i.e. the UUAA Authorization Payload) to the UAV if received from the UAS NF, as in steps 11, 12 and 13 in figure 4.3.2.2.1-1 of TS 23.502 [3].\nIf the authentication/ authorization result is a failure, the SMF rejects the PDU session establishment with a proper cause value.\n8.\t[Conditional] If the USS in step 6 subscribed to the PDU Session Status Event the SMF will, as described in steps 6-7 in Figure 4.15.3.2.3-1 of TS 23.502 [3], detect when the PDU Session is established, and send the PDU Session Establishment event report to the UAS NF/NEF by means of Nsmf_EventExposure_Notify message, including GPSI and the UE IP Address. Then, the UAS-NF/NEF forwards the event message to the USS.\nIf UUAA-SM fails during a Re-authentication and Re-authorization and the USS has indicated that the network resources can be released, SMF may trigger PDU Session release for UAS services with a proper cause value.\nNOTE 2:\tWhen the UUAA-SM fails during a Re-authentication, and the USS has not indicated that the network resources can be released, the USS can initiate UUAA revocation as described in clause 5.2.7.\nNOTE 3:\tIf C2 information reference is available from USS during the initial PDU Session Establishment procedure the SMF can interact with the PCF to set up a predefined PCC rule(s) profile for the C2 communication.\nIf the PDU session is released as per clause 4.3.4 of TS 23.502 [3] then the SMF shall notify the UAS NF/NEF about the PDU Session Status event (as specified in clause 4.15.3.2.3 of TS 23.502 [3]). Then the UAS NF/NEF may clear the UUAA-SM context and notify the USS about the PDU session release.",

In addition, the AMF(s) may also further identify UAVs that have successfully established PDU session for DNN(s) subject to aerial services, if it was included as an event filter in the request from UAS NF/NEF.\n3.\t[Optional] UAS NF to GMLC: From the list of UEs generated in step 2, for UAVs that are in target areas that do not map to 3GPP network areas, the UAS-NF then queries the UAV(s) location from GMLC.\n4.\t[Conditional] If step 3 above was executed, from the list of locations returned by the GMLC, the UAS NF compares the UAV's locations to the target area (provided in step 1 above) to identify the UAV to be included in the report for USS.\n5.\tFor either the UAV list received from the AMF(s)/MME(s), or the UAV list identified in step 4, the UAS NF performs the filtering by checking for each reported 3GPP UAV ID whether there is match for the corresponding UUAA context.\n6.\tUAS NF to USS: UAS NF responds to the USS/TPAE with the list of filtered UAVs (step 5). The CAA Level UAV ID, if available, may be provided by the UAS NF in the response message to USS/TPAE. If the USS performed the UUAA of the UAV, or the UAS NF is configured to know the USS is authorized to receive such information, then the 3GPP UAV ID is also included.",

      "content": "This clause provides a network-assisted (ground based) DAA mechanism. It is applicable for a specific area, such as a stadium or arena where UAVs are used e.g. for filming an event. It is based on a ground-based entity, Area Airspace Manager (AAM), that is able to detect UAVs in the specific area and provide local steering policies to the individual UASs in order to avoid the UAVs crashing into each other or different structures etc. The policy may e.g. include allowed flying zones and positions allowed for the specific UAV. The policy may also apply to a specific outdoor area, e.g. an event, where specific measures to avoid collision between drones are established locally.\nNOTE 1:\tThe policies provided by the AAM is application specific steering/DAA policies that are out of scope of 3GPP. The same or different local policies can be provided to the UAVs in the arena. UAVs can, for example, be given different fly zones in the arena just like people have different seating in an arena.\nThe high-level principles of the network-assisted (ground based) DAA are:\n-\tThe arena/area has a ground-based entity Area Airspace Manager (AAM). The AAM includes one or more UEs enabled for use of PC5. The AAM may also have a direct connection to the Data Network.\n-\tFor the applicable airspace of the area/arena the AAM defines individually adapted local collision avoidance rules for correspondingly located UAVs.\nNOTE 2:\tHow the AAM can determine the local steering policy for collision avoidance is out of scope of 3GPP. It can e.g. be based on maps of the area/arena and detailed information about the facilities together with an awareness of the current usage need for the airspace.\n-\tProvisioning of AAM local collision avoidance rules to a UAV/UE must comply with the policies for PC5 operations received from the 5GC or being preconfigured in the UE.\n-\tDetected UAVs are identified by their coordinates and by the Remote ID as retrieved by Broadcast Remote ID (BRID) or Network Remote ID (NRID) mechanisms dependent on the method used by the UAV.\nNOTE 3:\tHow the AAM can scan the UAVs in specific area is out of scope of 3GPP.\nNOTE 4:\tHow the AAM retrieves the Remote ID for detected UAVs is out of scope of 3GPP. For example, in case of BRID different UAVs can use different methods, such as WLAN, Bluetooth or PC5 direct communication, for broadcasting the Remote ID and in case of NRID the AAM will, based on the geolocation of the UAV, retrieve the Remote ID from the USS at application layer. For the NRID case the AAM will typically have to be authorized by the UTM to be allowed to retrieve the Remote ID.\n-\tBased on the retrieved Remote ID, the AAM activates PC5 communication with each detected UAV by triggering establishment of an A2X PC5 unicast link based on procedures described in clause 6 using the UAV's Remote-ID as Application-Layer-ID (i.e. Target User Info) in the Direct Communication Request message.\nFor Direct Communication over PC5 the UAV and AAM shall comply with the authorization and provisioning principles described in clause 4.2.1.2.2 including the following considerations:\n-\tThe default destination Layer-2 ID to be used for initial signalling to establish a unicast connection for the A2X service.\n-\tParameters for Groupcast are not applicable.\nNOTE 5:\tUse of LTE PC5 for the unicast is not supported in this Release.\n-\tThe AAM uses PC5 unicast link to provide each UAV present in the arena/area with local DAA policies as user traffic.\n-\tA UAV that receives local collision avoidance related policies from the AAM over PC5 may forward the policies to its UAV-C so that the UAV-C can steer the UAV accordingly by use of C2 communication (e.g. over Uu, PC5, or other means) in order to enforce the local policies and avoid collisions.\nNOTE 6:\tWhether and how to forward the policies from UAV to its UAV-C and how UAV-C uses the policies is out of scope of 3GPP.\nNOTE 7:\tA UAV-C that receives local collision avoidance policies from an AAM, can inform the AAM about its network address (e.g. IP address or URL) in order to enable direct AAM to UAV-C communication via Data Network. How a UAV-C communicates with the AAM is out of scope of 3GPP.\nFigure 5.7.1-1: Logical architecture for ground based DAA",

As a result of this procedure a PC5 unicast direct communication link enabling bidirectional data exchange is set up between the application layer in the AAM and the UAV application layer of the UAV/UE having the specified Remote-ID.\n5.\tOptionally the UAV/UE may, when the PC5 unicast direct communication link between the AAM and the UAV/UE has been set up for NR, activate a corresponding bidirectional communication connection extending the link from the UAV to the UAV-C using the specific communication technology used for C2 communication (may e.g. be LR Wi-Fi or PC5). This enables packets received on the link (i.e. from the AAM) to be forwarded to the UAV-C and packets received from the UAV-C to be forwarded on the link (i.e. towards the AAM). Implementation aspects for this step are out of scope for 3GPP.\n6.\tUsing the PC5 unicast direct communication link the AAM and the UAV establishes a bidirectional communication channel for exchange of messages. Optionally this channel can be extended to involve the UAV-C using the bi-directional tunnel. The protocol and implementation aspects for this step are out of scope for 3GPP.\nNOTE 2:\tThe UAV-C and/or the UAV can use the communication channel to provide application specific information to the AAM, how and what information is out of 3GPP scope. Based on awareness of the current UAV traffic situation, local info and plans for the area/arena, the AAM determines locations and flight paths appropriate for the specific UAV such that collisions can be avoided and creates a corresponding application specific steering policy being out of scope of 3GPP.\n7.\tThe AAM provides the determined steering policy to the specific UAV using the activated communication channel. Optionally it can be forwarded to the UAV-C which can return corresponding C2 commands. Protocols, semantics and syntax for handling this are application specific and out of 3GPP scope.\n8.\tThe UAV is steered to avoid collisions in accordance with received policy and using mechanisms that are out of scope for 3GPP.\nNOTE 3:\tA UAV-C that optionally receives local policies for DAA from an AAM, can inform the AAM of its address (e.g. IP address or URL) to enable direct AAM to UAV-C communication via Data Network.",

      "content": "There are two modes of operation for A2X communication, namely A2X communication over PC5 reference point and A2X communication over Uu reference point. These two operation modes may be used by a UE independently of different A2X communications.\nA2X communications over PC5 reference point are supported by LTE and/or NR.\nA2X communications over Uu reference point are supported by NR connected to 5GC.\nA2X leverages both LTE PC5 as defined in TS 23.285 [12] and NR PC5. For LTE PC5 in EPS, the network scheduled operation mode defined in TS 23.285 [12] is not supported and the A2X uses only the UE autonomous resources selection mode.\nGroupcast mode for NR based PC5 is not supported.\nSubscription to A2X services based on the user's profile stored in the UDM is supported as described in clause 6.2.5.\nBoth UAV UEs that utilize Uu connectivity and that do not utilize Uu connectivity (i.e. either UAV UEs that are Uu capable and do not use Uu) are supported. A UAV without utilizing Uu capabilities may use A2X for C2 communication, BRID and DDAA and be configured via A2X1 over a transport outside the scope of 3GPP.\nNOTE 1:\tUAV UEs without utilizing Uu capabilities are part of the 3GPP ecosystem since they use A2X1 for configuration by a A2X Application Server and implement PC5 connectivity specified by 3GPP.\nBoth UAVs with UICC and UAVs without UICC (i.e. with no subscription to an MNO) are supported. UAVs with no UICC can only perform A2X communications when authorized for \"not served by E-UTRA\" and \"not served by NR\".\nNo specific authorization of the use of PC5 for A2X services (i.e. BRID, DDAA, Ground based DAA) is required by the USS. For UAVs without UICC, or UAVs with UICC that are out of coverage or are served by a PLMN where UUAA has not been performed, the use of PC5-based communications for A2X services is authorized only by A2XP via pre-configuration or A2X1.\nIn this version of the specification, UAV UEs may support A2X capability for A2X communication over PC5 reference point and/or A2X capability for A2X communication over Uu reference point.\nIn this Release, communication over PC5 between the UAV UEs served by different PLMNs is possible in NR when the UAV UEs use the same sidelink carrier.\nUAV UEs that use the UE autonomous resources selection based on pre-configuration for NR PC5 can communicate over NR PC5 independently of the serving PLMN. The UE shall support the procedures described in clause 5.1.2.2 of TS 23.287 [11], for both E-UTRA and NR, so that the UE can perform A2X communications over PC5 reference point when \"not served by E-UTRA\" and \"not served by NR\". The UE, in order to perform these procedures, shall reliably locate itself in the corresponding Geographical Area. Otherwise, the UE is not authorized to transmit.\nNOTE 2:\tIt is out of scope of the present specification to define how the UE can locate itself in a specific Geographical Area. When the UE is in coverage of a 3GPP RAT, it can for example, use information derived from the serving PLMN. When the UE is not in coverage of a 3GPP RAT, it can use other techniques, e.g. Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). User provided location is not a valid input.\nNOTE 3:\tIt is assumed that any security of A2X solution is addressed by SA WG3.\nNOTE 4:\tThe A2X application layer schemes developed in other SDOs are outside the scope of this specification.",

      "content": "The UE Policy Association Establishment procedure and UE Policy Association Modification procedure, as defined in TS 23.502 [3], is used to provide to the AMF PC5 QoS parameters used by NG-RAN. When receiving Npcf_UEPolicyControl_Create Request from the AMF which includes the PC5 capability for A2X or when receiving the updated subscription data from UDR, the PCF generates the PC5 QoS parameters used by NG-RAN corresponding to a UE.\nThe (V-)PCF provides the information to the AMF as follows:\n-\tIn the roaming case, the H-PCF includes the PC5 QoS parameters used by NG-RAN in the Npcf_UEPolicyControl_Create Response message or Npcf_UEPolicyControl UpdateNotify Request message sent to V-PCF in an N2 PC5 policy container, and V-PCF relays this N2 PC5 policy container as the N2 container in the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer message sent to AMF.\n-\tIn the non-roaming case, the PCF includes the PC5 QoS parameters used by NG-RAN in an N2 container in Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer message sent to AMF.\nWhen the AMF determines that the N2 PC5 policy container comes from (V-)PCF, the AMF stores such information as part of the UE context.\nIn the UE Configuration Update procedure triggered by UE Policy Association Establishment or UE Policy Association Modification:\n-\tThe AMF forwards the PC5 QoS parameters in the NGAP message to the NG-RAN if a N2 PC5 policy container is received in the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer message.\n-\tThe AMF forwards the PC5 QoS parameters in the NAS message to UE by using the UE Configuration Update procedure for transparent UE Policy delivery procedure defined in clause 4.2.4.3 of TS 23.502 [3] if a UE Policy Container is received in the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer message.\nNOTE 1:\tIf the PC5 QoS parameters are provided to both NG-RAN and UE, both the N2 PC5 Policy Container and the UE Policy Container are included in the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer message.\nNOTE 2:\tNon-UE specific PC5 QoS parameters, e.g. default PC5 QoS parameters, can also be locally configured in NG-RAN. How such configuration is performed is out of scope of this specification.\nAnnex A (informative):Change history\nChange history\nDate\nMeeting\nTDoc\nCR\nRev\nCat\nSubject/Comment\nNew
