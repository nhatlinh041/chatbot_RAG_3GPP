Each individual MBMS session of an MBMS Bearer Service may be sent to a different MBMS Service Area. This MBMS Service Area is the same or a subset of the Multicast or Broadcast Service Area as defined in TS 22.146 [2]. An MBMS Service Area smaller than the Multicast or Broadcast Service Area is typically used for localized services.\nMBMS over a Single Frequency Network: See TS 25.346 [10].\nReceive Only Mode: A UE configuration option that allows a UE to receive only eMBMS broadcast service without the need to access and register with the PLMN offering the eMBMS service. A UE configured to operate in Receive Only Mode receives MBMS service only on a standardised TMGI value range. The UE uses the acquired system information to receive MBMS broadcast. Use of Receive Only Mode does not require USIM for the UE.\nShared MBMS Network: A network shared by multiple PLMNs that provides MBMS services. The Shared MBMS network consists of the following shared network elements: BM-SC(s) and MBMS-GW(s). The shared MBMS network may also include eNB(s), MCE(s), and shared MME(s) for MBMS operation.",

      "content": "MBMS is a point-to-multipoint service in which data is transmitted from a single source entity to multiple recipients. Transmitting the same data to multiple recipients allows network resources to be shared.\nThe MBMS bearer service offers two modes:\n-\tBroadcast Mode;\n-\tMulticast Mode.\nBroadcast Mode is supported for EPS and GPRS, and Multicast Mode is supported for GPRS. MBMS for EPS supports E-UTRAN and UTRAN. MBMS for GPRS supports UTRAN and GERAN.\nMBMS architecture enables the efficient usage of radio-network and core-network resources, with an emphasis on radio interface efficiency.\nMBMS is realised by the addition of a number of new capabilities to existing functional entities of the 3GPP architecture and by addition of a number of new functional entities.\nThe existing PS Domain functional entities (GGSN, SGSN, MME, E-UTRAN, UTRAN, GERAN and UE) are enhanced to provide the MBMS Bearer Service. In the EPS a functional entity MBMS GW exists at the edge between the CN and the BM-SC. In the bearer plane, this service provides delivery of IP Multicast datagrams from the Gi and SGi-mb reference points to UEs with a specified Quality of Service. In the control plane, this service provides mechanisms for:\n-\tmanaging the MBMS bearer service activation status of UEs (in the case of multicast mode);\n-\toutsourcing authorisation decisions to the MBMS User Service (i.e. to the BM-SC) (in the case of multicast mode);\n-\tproviding control of session initiation/modification/termination by the MBMS User Service and managing bearer resources for the distribution of MBMS data (in the case or multicast and broadcast modes).\nA particular instance of the MBMS Bearer Service is identified by an IP Multicast Address and an APN Network Identifier. A TMGI also can be used to identify one MBMS Bearer Service inside one PLMN.\nFor GPRS the boundary of the MBMS Bearer Service is the Gmb and Gi reference points as shown in Figure 1 below. The former provides access to the control plane functions and the latter the bearer plane. For EPS the boundary is the SGmb and the SGi-mb as shown in figure 1b below.\nA functional entity, the Broadcast Multicast Service Centre (BM-SC) provides a set of functions for MBMS User Services. BM-SC functions for different MBMS User Services may be supported from the same or different physical network elements.",

The MBMS service consumption reporting procedure is optional and initiated by the MBMS receiver (UE) to the BM-SC, in accordance with parameters in the Associated Delivery Procedure description as defined in TS 26.346 [7].\nThe BM-SC can specify the nominal periodicity by which the UE, when it is continuously consuming the service of concern, performs consumption reporting. The BM-SC can specify whether the UE includes its current location (serving cell-ID or MBMS SAI) when it performs consumption reporting. The location type is selected based on the Associated Delivery Procedure Description settings, or the MooD Management Object (MO) on the UE, or via UE pre-configuration rules. Typically, the BM-SC is pre-configured, via OAM procedures, with a threshold per location (number of UEs reporting consumption) to be used in making the decision to switch delivery method.\nThe service offloaded to the MBMS bearer could be either one delivered by unicast not involving MBMS User Services, or an MBMS User Service delivered on a unicast bearer. Furthermore, the BM-SC can determine, based on Consumption Reporting from UEs consuming that MBMS User Service over an MBMS bearer, the interest for that MBMS User Service has decreased sufficiently to terminate the MBMS bearer. In such event, UEs may continue to receive the service but over unicast instead, either not involving the MBMS User Service, or as an MBMS User Service over unicast. Continued consumption monitoring by the BM-SC, and consumption reporting by UEs, may be employed to facilitate further switching, over time, between bearer modes.\nAlong with MBMS Consumption Reporting, the use of MBMS operation on Demand (clause 7.4) permits certain content that is initially delivered over the unicast network to be turned into an MBMS User Service, in order to efficiently use network resources when the traffic exceeds a certain threshold.",

All QoS attributes related to the UMTS bearer service described in TS 23.107 [3] are applicable to MBMS bearer services. Compared to point-to-point bearer services the following limitations exist:\n-\tFor traffic class, only the background and streaming classes shall be supported.\n-\tFor SDU error ratio, only higher values are supported, i.e. the values describing higher numbers of lost or corrupted SDUs (actual values are for the background and streaming classes are 10-2 and 10-1).\n-\tFor maximum bit-rate, see the values described in TS 22.246 [6].\n-\tFor Guaranteed bit rate of the Streaming Traffic Class: depending on radio resource usage by other services, some cells of the MBMS Service Area may not have sufficient resources available for a MBMS Session. The RAN may decide not to establish RB in cells where requested resources are not available. The RAN does not reject a MBMS Session Start Request message even if one or more cells do not have enough resources to establish radio bearers.\nMBMS bearer services of background class are best suited for the transport of MBMS user services such as messaging or downloading. Buffering, shaping schemes and packet dropping may be applied to the traffic flow to adapt to the available resources and changing network conditions. The total transfer time is not critical for background class bearer services since the content must normally have been received in totality and stored in the UE before the user can access it.\nMBMS bearer services of streaming class are best suited for the transport of MBMS user services such as streaming. As for point-to-point bearer services, the network should minimise the packet transfer delay of streaming class bearer services as far as possible. Packet dropping should be the preferred traffic conditioning action applied to the traffic flow to adapt to the available resources.\nThe principle difference between background and streaming classes for MBMS is the support of a guaranteed bit-rate in the streaming case. No indication is provided to the UE in cases where the RAN cannot provide the requested QoS. As a result, some UEs may not receive the MBMS session or parts of it. For background class, the RAN may continue to distribute data in congestion conditions but at potentially high packet loss rates, therefore the MBMS user service will have to provide sufficient redundancy within the data to be able to cope with the high packet loss.\nMBMS user services that would normally use MBMS bearer services of background class may however decide to use a streaming class MBMS bearer service if the MBMS user service cannot cope with high packet loss.\nThe Allocation and Retention Priority of the MBMS bearer service allows for prioritisation between MBMS bearer services.\nAs the MBMS bearer service transfers data to many UEs in parallel and because of the lack of feedback channel on radio level low SDU error ratios are difficult to achieve. When the resulting packet error ratio is not suitable for the MBMS user service or when prevention of data loss is required, an MBMS user service may perform retransmission of MBMS data over a point-to-point PDP context.",

All EPS QoS attributes related to the EPS bearer service are applicable to MBMS bearer services.\nFor EPS, only GBR MBMS service is defined and the MBMS bearer service QoS includes the parameters QCI, ARP, GBR and MBR (TS 23.401 [16]).\nFor E-UTRAN MBMS bearer service for NB or M UE categories, operator defined QCIs may be configured in the BMSC and in the EUTRAN.\nThe BMSC may take into account the UE Capability for MBMS received via Activate MBMS Bearer Request in addition to the QoS requirements of the service and map that to a QCI value that is sent using MBMS Session Start Procedure towards EUTRAN (see TS 23.682 [29]).\nBMSC may be configured to take into account the UE Category for MBMS to derive operator defined QCIs.\nAn example mapping is shown below for a service with otherwise the same QoS requirements:\nTable 6.3.2-1: QCI association with UE Categories\nUE Categories supported\nOperator defined QCI\n(not standardised)\nIoT UE type M2\na\nBoth UE Category M1 and M2 UEs\nb\nIoT UE type NB2\nc\nBoth UE Category NB1 and NB2\nd\nThe BMSC may receive coverage level information for MBMS in addition to the UE Category for MBMS. When coverage information is received, and the BMSC is configured to take into account the coverage level, then BMSC generates the appropriate QCI based on the UE Category for MBMS and coverage level information for the MBMS service as defined in TS 23.682 [29].\nAn example mapping is shown below for a service with otherwise the same QoS requirements including coverage level:\nTable 6.3.2-2: QCI association with UE Categories and coverage level\nUE Categories supported\nOperator defined QCI\n(not standardised)\nIoT UE type M2, Coverage level: Medium\na\nIoT UE type M2, Coverage level: Normal\nb\nIoT UE type M2 Coverage level: High\nc\nBoth UE Category M1 and M2 UEs\nd\nIoT UE type NB2\ne\nBoth UE Category NB1 and NB2\nf\nNOTE 1:\tThe QCI to and from UE Capability for MBMS needs to be the same in E-UTRAN and BMSC.\nEach GBR MBMS bearer service is associated with the following MBMS bearer level QoS parameters:\n-\tQoS Class Identifier (QCI);\n-\tAllocation and Retention Priority (ARP);\n-\tMaximum Bit Rate (MBR);\n-\tGuaranteed Bit Rate (GBR).\nUnlike point-to-point EPS bearers, the MBR of a particular GBR bearer service shall be set equal to the GBR.\nNOTE 2:\tUE-AMBR and APN-AMBR do not apply to MBMS bearer services.\nCompared to point-to-point bearer services the following limitations exist:\n-\tFor Guaranteed bit rate: depending on radio resource usage by other services, some cells of the MBMS Service Area may not have sufficient resources available for a MBMS Session. The RAN may decide not to establish RB in cells where requested resources are not available. The RAN does not reject a MBMS Session Start Request message even if one or more cells do not have enough resources to establish radio bearers.\n-\tMBMS bearer admission control within E-UTRAN is constrained by the E-UTRAN resources that are configured for MBMS.\nIn the case of E-UTRAN, established MBMS bearers may not always use all the resources configured for MBMS. When the resources configured for MBMS are not fully utilised, the E-UTRAN may schedule delivery of traffic from point-to-point bearers using some of the un-utilised MBMS resources (refer to TS 36.213 [25]).\nGBR MBMS bearer services are best suited for the transport of MBMS user services where a constant bit rate is needed. As for point-to-point bearer services, the network should comply with the transfer delay for GBR QCI's (TS 23.203 [23]). Packet dropping should be the preferred traffic conditioning action applied to the traffic flow to adapt to the available resources. The BM-SC ensures that the bit rate is not larger than the MBR. There is no radio aware flow shaping in the BM-SC.\nThe Allocation and Retention Priority of the MBMS bearer service allows for prioritisation between MBMS bearer services at MBMS bearer service establishment.\nWhen the MBMS bearer service experience a packet error ratio which is not suitable for the MBMS user service or when prevention of data loss is required, an MBMS user service may perform retransmission of MBMS data over a point-to-point PDP context or PDN connection.",

This is a request to activate all necessary bearer resources in the network for the transfer of MBMS data and to notify interested UEs of the imminent start of the transmission.\nThrough this procedure, MBMS session attributes such as QoS, MBMS service Area, estimated session duration, are provided to the registered GGSN(s) and SGSN(s), to all BSCs/RNCs that are connected to a listed SGSN and to the registered MBMS GW(s) and MME(s). In addition the procedure allocates the bearer plane to all registered GGSNs, all registered SGSNs and all registered MBMS GWs, to BSCs/RNCs and E-UTRAN that respond to the session start request message. If IP multicast distribution of MBMS user plane data to E-UTRAN/UTRAN is supported, the MBMS-GW allocates an IP Multicast address together with the corresponding IP address of the multicast source (i.e. MBMS GW) and the C-TEID are provided to the eNodeB via MME and to the RNC via SGSN in this procedure. Optionally, in the case of E-UTRAN access (e.g. in deployments with a mix of IPv4 and IPv6 eNodeBs and/or backhauls) and if the MBMS‑GW supports both IPv4 and IPv6, both an IPv4 and an IPv6 IP Multicast address together with the corresponding alternative IP addresses of the multicast source are also allocated by the MBMS‑GW and provided to the E-UTRAN via the MME. An IP multicast address and the paired IP address of the multicast source shall be of the same IP type.\nAfter sending the Session Start Request message the BM-SC waits for a configurable delay (time to MBMS data transfer) before sending MBMS data. This delay should be long enough to avoid buffering of MBMS data in entities other than the BM-SC, i.e. the delay should allow the network to perform all procedures required to enable MBMS data transfer before the BM-SC sends MBMS data. For example notification of UEs and radio bearer establishment should be performed before MBMS data arrive in the RAN. The delay may be in the region of multiple seconds or tens of seconds. It may be useful for the BM-SC to be able to configure different delays for MBMS bearer services on 2G, 3G and E-UTRAN, respectively.\nFor the distributed MCE architectures, i.e. when the MCE is part of the eNB as described in clause 15.1.1 in TS 36.300 [17], an absolute time stamp for when data can be expected, \"MBMS data transfer start\", should be used at MBSFN operation mode to ensure synchronized session control and to facilitate a graceful reallocation of resources for the MBSFN when needed. When the parameter \"MBMS data transfer start\" is present, a receiving supporting node shall ignore the parameter \"time to MBMS data transfer\". For session stop signalling, the parameter \"MBMS data transfer stop\" is if present used to schedule the release of the radio resources in order to ensure a synchronized session control.",

The message is sent to the MBMS GWs listed in the \"downstream nodes\" parameter of the corresponding MBMS Bearer Context in the BM-SC. The BM-SC may start multiple sessions for the same MBMS bearer service (identified by the TMGI) but with different content. If so, a Flow Identifier is included in the Session Start Request to identify the different sub-sessions and the associated MBMS Service Areas shall not overlap. The Access indicator indicates in which radio access types the MBMS service should be broadcasted, i.e. UTRAN, or E-UTRAN, or both. The Access indicator may be included in charging information generated by the MBSM GW.\nIf MBMS‑GW is configured to delay response to BMSC when access type is E-UTRAN, then MBMS‑GW delays response to BMSC (i.e. step 2) until after step 6 is executed as shown in figure 8b.2. This configuration should be only performed when E-UTRAN executes step 7 below before responding to the MBMS Session Start message as specified in TS 36.300 [17].\nNOTE:\tIt is up to the operator to ensure that E-UTRAN, MBMS‑GW and BMSC are configured only when E‑UTRAN supports delaying the response from eNB.\n2.\tThe MBMS GW responds with a Session Start Response message with information for BM-SC to send MBMS data to the MBMS GW , if figure 8b.1 is executed. The MBMS‑GW responds only after first MME response in step 6 is received, if it is configured to do so as shown in figure 8b.2.\n3.\tThe MBMS GW creates an MBMS bearer context. The MBMS GW stores the session attributes and the list of MBMS control plane nodes in the MBMS bearer context and allocates a transport network IP multicast address or, optionally, for E-UTRAN access (e.g. in deployments with a mix of IPv4 and IPv6 eNodeBs and/or backhauls) and if the MBMS‑GW supports both IPv4 and IPv6, both an IPv4 and an IPv6 IP Multicast address, according to clause 6.5.3 and a C-TEID for this session. The MBMS GW sends a Session Start Request message including the session attributes (TMGI, Flow Identifier, QoS, MBMS service Area, list of cell IDs if available, Session identifier, estimated session duration, transport network IP Multicast Address(es), IP address(es) of the multicast source, C-TEID, ...) to MMEs and/or SGSNs listed in the \"list of MBMS control plane nodes\" parameter after filtering the list using the Access indicator, thus ignoring entries not consistent with the Access indicator.\n4.\tThe MME or SGSN creates an MBMS bearer context. The MME/SGSN stores the session attributes and sends a Session Start Request message including the session attributes (TMGI, QoS, MBMS service area, list of cell IDs if available, Session identifier, estimated session duration, broadcast (for UTRAN only), transport network IP Multicast Address, IP address of the multicast source, C-TEID, ...) to E-UTRAN/UTRAN. Optionally in the case of E-UTRAN access and if the MBMS‑GW supports both IPv4 and IPv6, the MME includes both an IPv4 and an IPv6 IP Multicast address together with the corresponding alternative IP address(es) of the multicast source. When connected to multiple MCEs, the MME should filter the distribution of Session Control message to the MCEs based on the MBMS service area.\nFor UTRAN, if one or more of the downstream nodes accepts the Session Start with the proposed IP Multicast and Source addresses for backbone distribution and the proposed C-TEID, the SGSN includes an indication that IP Multicast distribution is accepted in the MBMS Session Start Response message to MBMS GW. If one or more of the downstream nodes does not accept the proposed IP Multicast and Source addresses for backbone distribution or the proposed C-TEID, the SGSN falls back to normal point-to-point MBMS bearer establishment for these nodes and responds with an MBMS Session Start Response message providing the TEID for bearer plane that the MBMS GW shall use for forwarding the MBMS data. Otherwise if all nodes accept multicast, the SGSN returns the C-TEID and the IP Multicast distribution address in the Session Start Response message.\nFor E-UTRAN access, eNB may respond to Session Start Request after first successful MBMS resources have been reserved (i.e. step 7) which indicates to the BMSC that there are resources already available for MBMS data delivery, as shown in figure 8b.2.\n5.\tThe E-UTRAN/UTRAN creates an MBMS bearer context. The E-UTRAN/UTRAN stores the session attributes, sets the state attribute of its MBMS Bearer Context to 'Active' (in UTRAN only) and responds the MME/SGSN to confirm the reception of the Session Start Request message. When a cell ID list is included in the Session Start Request, E-UTRAN uses it to determine a set of radio resources to be used for the broadcast. Based on the cell ID list, the set of radio resources selected may be reduced from the full set of resources defined by the MBMS service area. The E-UTRAN ensures that all of its corresponding nodes make the same decision on the reduced set.\nFor UTRAN, if an RNC accepts the Session start and the proposed IP Multicast and Source addresses for backbone distribution and the proposed C-TEID the RNC sends an MBMS Session Start Response message to SGSN including an indication that IP Multicast distribution is accepted. If an RNC does not accept the proposed IP Multicast and Source address for backbone distribution (or the proposed C-TEID), the RNC falls back to normal point-to-point MBMS bearer establishment.\n6.\tThe MME/SGSN stores the session attributes and the identifier of the eNBs/RNCs as the \"list of downstream nodes\" parameter in its MBMS Bearer Context and responds to the MBMS GW. The SGSN should wait for a response from all UTRAN nodes (until an acceptable duration) to be able to report to the MBMS‑GW whether all, part or none of the RNCs have accepted IP multicast distribution and to provide an SGSN IP address and TEID for user plane over Sn if some RNCs did not accept IP multicast distribution. The MME may return an MBMS Session Start Response to the MBMS-GW as soon as the session request is accepted by one E-UTRAN node. The MBMS‑GW initiates IP Multicast distribution and/or point-to-point MBMS bearers (for UTRAN only) depending on the responses from the MMEs/SGSNs.\nIf the MBMS‑GW is configured to delay response to the BMSC, MBMS‑GW waits until step 6 occurs before responding to the BMSC as shown in figure 8b.2.\n7.\tThe E-UTRAN/UTRAN establishes the necessary radio resources for the transfer of MBMS data to the interested UEs. For E-UTRAN the radio resource set up is scheduled using the MBMS data transfer start parameter if it is present, otherwise using the time to MBMS data transfer parameter. The MBMS data transfer start parameter is not used by UTRAN.\n8.\tIf the E-UTRAN/UTRAN node accepts IP Multicast distribution, it joins the appropriate transport network IP multicast address (including the IP address of the multicast source) allocated by the MBMS GW, to enable reception of MBMS data. If several MBMS bearer services uses the same IP multicast address, the join is only done once.\n9.\tThe BM-SC starts sending the MBMS data.\n10.\tMBMS GW function receives MBMS data.

The multicast service deactivation can be initiated by:\n-\tThe UE;\n-\tThe GGSN;\n-\tThe BM-SC; or\n-\tThe SGSN\nAll these cases are contained in the procedure illustrated in figure 13. The UE initiated Multicast Service Deactivation starts with step 1), the BM-SC initiated Multicast Service Deactivation starts with step 3), the GGSN initiated Multicast Service Deactivation starts with step 4), the SGSN initiated Multicast Service Deactivation starts with step 5) or 9), and the MBMS UE de-linking is performed at step 7).\nAt GPRS detach, all MBMS UE contexts of the UE are implicitly deactivated in the UE, SGSN and GGSN, i.e. the SGSN performs the deactivation procedure starting with step 7).\nIf the PDP context linked to the MBMS UE context by the linked NSAPI is deactivated by the UE or SGSN or GGSN, then the SGSN shall perform the MBMS deactivation procedure starting with step 7). The UE will remove all MBMS UE Contexts locally after the Linked PDP Context was deactivated.\nFigure 13: MBMS Multicast Service Deactivation\n1.\tThe UE sends an IGMP (IPv4) or MLD (IPv6) Leave message (here, the Leave message means Leave Group message in RFC 2236 for IGMP (IPv4) and Multicast Listener Done in RFC2710 for MLD (IPv6)) over the default PDP context to leave a particular multicast service identified by an IP multicast address.\n2.\tThe GGSN sends a Leave Indication (IP multicast address, APN,IMSI) to the BM-SC Proxy and Transport function, which forwards it to the BM-SC Membership function, indicating that the UE is requesting to leave the multicast service identified by the IP multicast address. The exact nature of the signalling between GGSN and BM-SC is specified in TS 29.061 [4].\n3.\tUpon reception of the Leave Indication, the BM-SC Membership function verifies that the IP multicast address corresponds to a valid MBMS bearer service and sends a UE Removal Request (IP multicast address, APN, IMSI) to the GGSN that originated the Leave Indication.

This GGSN may be different from the GGSN that receives IGMP Leave request in step 1.\n10.\tThe GGSN deletes the MBMS UE Context and sends a Deactivation Indication to the BM-SC to confirm the successful deactivation of the MBMS UE Context.

The TMGI and Session identifier identifies the ongoing session. Apart from the ARP parameter, all other parameters in the QoS profile shall be identical as in the preceding Session Start message. The ARP parameter may be different if it is to be updated. The MBMS Service Area and the list of MBMS control plane nodes (MMEs, SGSNs) for MBMS GW define the new service area. The estimated session duration shall be set to a value corresponding to the remaining part of the session. If radio access of MBMS service is updated the Access indicator shall be included to indicate in which radio access types the MBMS service should be broadcasted, i.e. UTRAN, or E-UTRAN, or both. The ARP parameter may be updated only if the Access Indicator indicates E-UTRAN. The Access indicator may be included in charging information generated by the MBMS‑GW.\nIf MBMS‑GW is configured to delay response to BMSC when access type is E-UTRAN, then MBMS‑GW delays response to BMSC (i.e. Step 2) until after step 6 is executed as shown in figure 13c-2. This configuration should be only performed when E-UTRAN executes step 7 below before responding to the MBMS Session Update message as specified in TS 36.300 [17].\nNOTE:\tIt is up to the operator to ensure that E-UTRAN, MBMS‑GW and BMSC are configured only when E‑UTRAN supports delaying the response from eNB.\n2.\tThe MBMS GW stores the new session attributes in the MBMS Bearer Context and sends a Session Update Response message to the BM-SC, if figure 13c-1 is executed. The MBMS‑GW responds only after first MME response in step 6 is received, if it is configured to do so as shown in figure 13c-2.\n3.\tThe MBMS GW filters the new list of MBMS control plane nodes using the Access indicator to ignore entries not consistent with the Access indicator, and compares remaining entries in the new list of MBMS control plane nodes with the list of MBMS control plane nodes it has stored in the MBMS Bearer Context. It sends an MBMS Session Start Request message to any added MME/SGSN, an MBMS Session Stop Request to any removed MME/SGSN, and an MBMS Session Update Request (TMGI, Flow Identifier, QoS, MBMS Service Area, list of cell IDs if available, Session identifier, estimated session duration, ...) to the remaining MME/SGSNs in the new list. The handlings of the MBMS Session Start/Stop Request message are described in clauses 8.3.2 and 8.5.2.\n4.\tThe MME/SGSN receiving an MBMS Session Update Request message, sends an MBMS Session Update Request message including the session attributes (TMGI, QoS, MBMS service Area, list of cell IDs if available, Session identifier, estimated session duration, broadcast (for UTRAN only), transport network IP Multicast Address, IP address of the muticast source, C‑TEID, etc.) to each eNodeB/MCE/RNC that is connected to the MME/SGSN.\nFor E-UTRAN, when connected to multiple MCEs, the MME should filter the distribution of MBMS Session Update Request messages to the MCEs based on the MBMS service area.\nFor UTRAN, if one or more of the downstream nodes newly added to the MBMS Service Area accepts the Session Update and the proposed IP Multicast and Source address for backbone distribution and the proposed C‑TEID, the SGSN includes an indication that IP Multicast distribution is accepted in the MBMS Session Update Response message to MBMS GW. If one or more of the downstream nodes newly added to the MBMS Service Area does not accept the proposed IP Multicast and Source address for backbone distribution or the proposed C‑TEID, the SGSN falls back to normal point-to-point MBMS bearer establishment for these nodes and responds with an MBMS Session Update Response message providing the TEID for bearer plane that the MBMS GW shall use for forwarding the MBMS data. Otherwise if all nodes accept multicast, the SGSN returns the C‑TEID and the IP Multicast distribution address in the Session Update Response message.\nE-UTRAN may respond to Session Update Request after first successful MBMS resources have been set up or released (i.e. Step 7) which indicates to the BMSC that there are resources already available for MBMS data delivery, as shown in figure 13c-2.\n5.\tIf the E-UTRAN/UTRAN has no MBMS bearer context with the TMGI indicated in the MBMS Session Update Request message, the E-UTRAN/UTRAN creates an MBMS bearer context and sets its state attribute to 'Active' (in UTRAN only). Otherwise the E-UTRAN/UTRAN compare the new service area with the one it has stored in the MBMS Bearer Context and make the corresponding update. Then the E-UTRAN/UTRAN responds the MME/SGSN to confirm the reception of the Session Update Request message. When a cell ID list is included in the Session Start Request, E-UTRAN uses it to determine a set of radio resources to be used for the broadcast. Based on the cell ID list, the set of radio resources selected may be reduced from the full set of resources defined by the MBMS service area. The E-UTRAN ensures that all of its corresponding nodes make the same decision on the reduced set.\nFor UTRAN, if an RNC newly added to the MBMS Service Area accepts the Session Update and the proposed IP Multicast and Source address for backbone distribution and the proposed C-TEID the RNC sends an MBMS Session Update Response message to SGSN including an indication that IP Multicast distribution is accepted. If an RNC newly added to the MBMS Service Area does not accept the proposed IP Multicast and Source address for backbone distribution (or the proposed C‑TEID), the RNC falls back to normal point-to-point MBMS bearer establishment.\n6.\tThe MME/SGSN updates the session attributes in its MBMS Bearer Context and responds to the MBMS GW. The SGSN should wait for a response from all UTRAN nodes (until an acceptable duration) if the Service Area has been changed to be able to report to the MBMS‑GW whether all, part or none of any newly added RNCs have accepted IP multicast distribution and to provide an SGSN IP address and TEID for user plane over Sn if some RNCs did not accept IP multicast distribution. The MME may return a response to the MBMS-GW as soon as the session update request is accepted by one E-UTRAN node.\nIf the MBMS‑GW is configured to delay response to the BMSC, MBMS‑GW waits until step 6 occurs before responding to the BMSC as shown in figure 13c-2.\n7.\tThe E-UTRAN/UTRAN establishes/releases the radio resources for the transfer of MBMS data to the interested UEs. If the ARP parameter is updated the MCE shall ensure that any necessary changes to radio resources are synchronized across all eNBs in the corresponding MBSFN area. For E-UTRAN the radio resource set up is scheduled using the MBMS data transfer start parameter if it is present, otherwise using the time to MBMS data transfer parameter if it is present. The MBMS data transfer start parameter is not used by UTRAN.\n8.\tThe eNodeBs/RNCs send IP multicast Join or Leave message to the received user plane IP multicast address allocated by the MBMS GW.

Shared MBMS Network has MBMS synchronization area (MBSFN area) defined within each PLMN.\nThe SMN has the following properties:\n-\tThe BM-SC and MBMS‑GW are shared among participating PLMNs.\n-\tThe SMN provides the entry point of the data stream.\n-\tThe BM-SC can provide full service layer functionality or act only in transparent mode for the case of MBMS as transport only.\n-\tAn MBMS service area may span across RAN nodes from different participating PLMNs.\n-\tRAN nodes (eNBs/MCEs) dedicated to MBMS bearer service may be deployed, in which case these nodes are part of the SMN. This deployment requires a shared MME function.\nD.2\tArchitecture\nD.2.1\tArchitecture for per PLMN MBSFN synchronization area\nFigure D.2.1-1 shows and example network architecture for Shared MBMS Network with MBMS synchronization area defined within each PLMN. The example shows two PLMNs (PLMN 1 and PLMN2) providing shared MBMS service. In the example, F3 is shared spectrum used by all involved PLMN for MBMS service.\nFigure D.2.1-1: Shared MBMS Network architecture with per-PLMN MBMS synchronization area\nThe SMN contains the following network elements:\n-\tShared BM-SC (denoted BM-SC(SMN) in Figure D.2.1-1):\n-\tProvides all the functionality defined in clause 5.1 for EPC.\n-\tShared MBMS-GW (denoted MBMS-GW(SMN) in Figure D.2.1-1)\n-\tProvides all the functionality defined in clause 5.9.1.\n-\tIn addition:\n-\tIt connects to MMEs from one or multiple PLMNs via the inter-PLMN Sm-s reference point for control plane signalling.\n-\tIt connects to E-UTRAN nodes from one or multiple PLMNs via the inter-PLMN M1-s reference point for IP multicast distribution.\nThe SMN may also contain shared E-UTRAN functionality for the purpose of MBMS service only. In that case the SMN also contains the following network entities:\n-\tShared E-UTRAN - eNB, MCE (denoted RAN(SMN) in Figure D.2.1-1)\n-\tProvides functionality as defined in clause 5.9.1.\n-\tShared MME MBMS function (denoted MME(SMN)):\n-\tThe shared MME MBMS control function provides the functionality defined in clause 5.9.2.\nNOTE:\tThe shared MME MBMS control function provides only a subset of the functionality of a regular MME as defined in TS 23.401 [16], dedicated only to providing control plane functionality related to MBMS service.\nD.2.2\tReference Points\nThe following reference points are defined for Shared MBMS Network:\n-\tAll internal reference points within the SMN leverage existing reference points M1, M2, M3, Sm, SGmb, SGi-mb.\n-\tAll internal reference points within each PLMN existing reference points M2, M3\n-\tM1-s:\n-\tInter-PLMN reference point between the Shared MBMS‑GW and the E-UTRAN node from a participating PLMN.\n-\tProvides equivalent functionality to M1.\n-\tSm-s:\n-\tInter-PLMN reference point between the Shared MBMS‑GW and MME from a participating PLMN.\n-\tProvides equivalent functionality to Sm.\nD.2.3\tUE Aspects\nDifferent scenarios can be supported from the perspective of the UE. The following is a non-exhaustive list of possible scenarios:\nUE Scenario 1:\tThe UE receives both unicast and broadcast service from same PLMN. The UE follows the same functionality as defined in clause 5.2.\nUE Scenario 2:\tThe UE receives broadcast MBMS service without PLMN subscription over E-UTRAN without the need to access and register with the PLMN offering the MBMS service. The UE acts in Receive Only mode as defined in Annex E.\nUE Scenario 3:\tThe UE receives unicast service from one serving PLMN's (e.g. the PLMN for which it has unicast subscription), and receive MBMS service through a different PLMN. The UE acts in Receive Only mode with independent unicast as defined in Annex E.\nD.2.4\tTMGI for shared MBMS networks\nAS described in TS 23.003 [13], the TMGI is composed by an MBMS Service ID and a PLMN ID (MCC/MNC).\nThere construction of the PLMN ID field in the TMGI is deployment dependent. The following are example deployment options:\n-\tExample Deployment Option 1: Shared PLMN ID\n-\tA Shared PLMN ID is used for the shared MBMS service. The shared PLMN ID is broadcasted in the cells broadcasting the shared MBMS service content.\n-\tExample Deployment Option 2: Internal PLMN ID in the Shared MBMS network\n-\tThe Shared MBMS network (i.e. BMSC) uses the \"Internal\" PLMN ID to generate the TMGI. MBMS-GW uses the PLMN ID from the incoming SGmb interface towards the rest of the network entities in the MBMS path. eNB announces a MBMS session TMGI whose PLMN ID is not in the SIB1 PLMN ID list. The \"Internal\" PLMN ID is not used for any other PLMN services.\nAnnex E (normative):UE behaviour in Receive Only Mode\nA UE configured as Receive Only Mode can receive only MBMS broadcast service over E-UTRAN without the need to access and register with the PLMN offering the MBMS service. A UE configured to operate in Receive Only Mode shall shall camp on a network cell in an eMBMS Broadcast carrier, shall attempt to receive MBMS service based only on a standardised TMGI value range for Receive Only Mode. The UE shall not attempt to receive MBMS service for TMGIs outside the standardized TMGI range. The UE shall refrain from any Mobility Management or other signalling with the network offering MBMS. The UE uses the acquired system information to receive MBMS broadcast. Use of Receive Only Mode does not require USIM for the UE.\nA UE may be configured as Receive Only Mode with independent unicast using EPS bearer contexts. This configuration option allows a UE to operate as Receive Only Mode (as defined above) for MBMS broadcast service, and independently follows regular NAS/RRC procedures for unicast service with a PLMN. This mode of operation requires USIM and PLMN subscription to receive unicast service. No additional subscription or credentials are required to receive MBMS broadcast service.\nAny device that is equipped with MBMS broadcast receiver and is configured to operate in Receive Only Mode is able to receive the broadcast content, with the following characteristics:\n-\tNo PLMN credentials/subscription are required, as long as use of EPS unicast bearers is not required by the device.\n-\tWithout PLMN credentials/subscription, the UE can only access broadcast services without subscription. The content can be Free To Air (FTA) content as defined in TS 22.101 [30] in which case it can be viewed without content subscription.\n-\tThere is no need for the UE to support uplink.\nNOTE:\tIt is possible though that there is content protection handled at application layer. In that case security is provided at application layer, and keys, etc. are provisioned out of band. This provisioning is out of scope of 3GPP.\nThe UE is preconfigured with all the necessary information for the UE to acquire the system information and receive MBMS service. This information includes:\n-\tPLMN ID(s) that provide the MBMS service.\n-\tTMGI(s):\n-\tIn the case of the network providing MBMS service in MBMS transport only mode, the TMGI(s) for each MBMS service need to be configured in the UE.\n-\tThe UE may be configured to receive TMGI(s) via Service Announcement (see clauses 4.4.3.1, 5.1.4 and 6.4).\n-\tRAN specific information,\n-\tUSD(s).\nFigure E-1 shows the components of a UE in Receive Only Mode and in Receive Only Mode with independent unicast.\nFigure E-1: UE components in Receive Only Mode and Receive Only Mode with independent unicast\nThe unicast component is active only in Receive Only Mode with independent unicast. The unicast component follows regular NAS/RRC procedures for E-UTRAN/EPC in order to receive unicast service.\nFor the broadcast component, the UE is configured with MBMS radio resources for TV service with no PLMN subscription. The broadcast component of the UE shall camp on a network cell in an eMBMS Broadcast carrier and shall attempt to receive MBMS service based only on a standardised TMGI value range. The UE shall not attempt to receive MBMS service for TMGIs outside the standardized TMGI range. The broadcast component shall refrain from any Mobility Management or other signalling with the network offering MBMS. The broadcast component uses the acquired system information to receive MBMS broadcast.\nAnnex C (Informative):Change history\nChange history\nDate\nMeeting\nTDoc\nCR\nRev\nCat\nSubject/Comment\nNew version\n2011-12\nSA#54\nSP-110748\n0269\n4\nC\nMBMS data transfer time\n11.0.0\n2012-03\nSA#55\nSP-120088\n0273\n-\nF\nCorrection to Absolute Start Time for MBMS Data Delivery\n11.1.0\n2013-12\nSA#62\nSP-130534\n0276\n3\nC\nM1 Group reuse\n12.0.0\n2014-03\nSA#63\nSP-140102\n0277\n1\nB\nMBMS bearer priority update\n12.1.0\n2014-06\nSA#64\nSP-140377\n0279\n2\nF\nResource allocation for the MBMS bearer\n12.2.0\n2014-06\nSA#64\nSP-140260\n0281\n1\nF\nLift restriction GBR=MBR for MBMS when GCSE is used\n12.2.0\n2014-09\nSA#65\nSP-140425\n0384\n1\nF\nClarify the MBMS session update procedure\n12.3.0\n2014-12\nSA#66\nSP-140678\n0387\n4\nF\nLong Group Calls and New Cells\n12.4.0\n2015-03\nSA#67\nSP-150015\n0390\n-\nA\nCorrection to BM-SC initiated Session Update procedure\n12.5.0\n2015-03\nSA#67\nSP-150027\n0391\n2\nB\neMBMS alternative IP multicast distribution address\n13.0.0\n2015-03\nSA#67\nSP-150239\n0392\n1\nF\nMBMS Session Start procedure correction and editorial corrections\n13.1.0\n2015-09\nSA#69\nSP-150239\n0394\n2\nA\nSupport for UE Consumption Reporting towards BM-SC\n13.2.0\n2015-09\nSA#69\nSP-150506\n0396\n2\nB\nMBMS bearer establishment and update with cell ID list\n13.2.0\n2015-12\nSA#70\nSP-150616\n0397\n2\nF\nCell ID in MBMS bearer context table for EPS\n13.3.0\n2015-12\nSA#70\nSP-150614\n0398\n2\nF\nDifferentiate MBMS User and Bearer Services\n13.3.0\n2016-09\nSA#73\nSP-160656\n0402\n1\nB\nEnhanced TV services using Broadcast and Unicast mode of operation\n14.0.0\n2016-09\nSA#73\nSP-160656\n0404\n2\nB\nIntroducing Shared eMBMS Network and Receive Only Mode for TV services\n14.0.0\n2016-12\nSA#74\nSP-160820\n0405\n1\nF\nCorrections of MBMS Shared Network\n14.1.0\n2016-12\nSA#74\nSP-160820\n0406\n1\nF\n3GPP network and Content provider reference point\n14.1.0\n2016-12\nSA#74\nSP-160820\n0407\n1\nF\nShared MBMS Network scope clarification\n14.1.0\n2016-12\nSA#74\nSP-160820\n0408\n2\nF\nUse of TMGI & PLMN ID for Shared MBMS Network\n14.1.0\n2016-12\nSA#74\nSP-160825\n0412\n1\nF\nMBMS Update with session time\n14.1.0\n2017-09\nSA#77\nSP-170723\n0414\n4\nC\nUE Capabilities for MBMS\n14.2.0\n2017-12\nSA#78\nSP-170928\n0415\n1\nC\nMBMS session setup/event notification procedure alignment with RAN WG3\n15.0.0\n2017-12\nSA#78\nSP-170928\n0416\n2\nF\nMB2 improvements for GCS AS to be able to request application of FEC and/or RoHC to a MBMS bearer\n15.0.0\n2019-03\nSA#83\nSP-190175\n0417\n1\nF\nChange xMB reference\n16.0.0\n2019-09\nSA#85\nSP-190602\n0419\n2\nA\nFix missed update to Session Update procedure - add delayed response\n16.1.0\n2022-03\nSA#95E\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-17 version (MCC)\n17.0.0\n2024-03\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-18 version (MCC)\n18.0.0",
