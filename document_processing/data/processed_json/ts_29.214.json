The functional requirements and the stage 2 specifications of the Rx reference point are contained in 3GPP TS 23.203 [2].\nThe Rx reference point lies between the Application Function (AF) and the Policy and Charging Rule Function (PCRF). In the 5GS the Rx reference point resides between the AF and the Policy Control Function (PCF) as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [55] and 3GPP TS 23.503 [56].\nNOTE:\tInteractions between the PCF and the AF using the 5GS Npcf_PolicyAuthorization service (the N5 reference point) are defined in 3GPP TS 29.514 [57].\nThe Rx interface which is based on RESTful HTTP and XML is specified in 3GPP TS 29.201 [37].\nWhenever it is possible the present document specifies the requirements for the protocol by reference to specifications produced by the IETF within the scope of Diameter.

The bit rate in bit/s can be abbreviated with bps. This specification uses SI (International System of Units) prefixes as unit prefixes, which strictly refer to the power of 10, and shall not be used for the power of 2. For example, 1 kbit/s represents 1000 bit/s or 1 Mbit/s represents 1000 kbit/s and so on.\nIP-CAN bearer: IP transmission path of defined capacity, delay and bit error rate, etc.See 3GPP TR 21.905 [1] for the definition of bearer.\nIP-CAN session: association between a UE and an IP network (for GPRS, APN).The association is identified by one UE Ipv4 address and/or one Ipv6 prefix together with a UE identity information, if available, and a PDN represented by a PDN ID (e.g. an APN). An IP-CAN session incorporates one or more IP-CAN bearers. Support for multiple IP-CAN bearers per IP-CAN session is IP-CAN specific. An IP-CAN session exists as long as the related UE Ipv4 address and/or Ipv6 prefix are assigned and announced to the IP network.\nIP flow: unidirectional flow of IP packets with the same source IP address and port number and the same destination IP address and port number and the same transport protocolPort numbers are only applicable if used by the transport protocol.\nMPS session: A session for which priority treatment is applied for allocating and maintaining radio and network resources to support the Multimedia Priority Service (MPS). MPS is defined in 3GPP TS 22.153 [31].\nPacket flow: A specific user data flow carried through the PCEF. A packet flow can be an IP flow.\nPCC rule: set of information enabling the detection of a service data flow and providing parameters for policy control and/or charging control.\nRESTful HTTP: is an architectural style consisting of a coordinated set of architectural constraints applied to components, connectors, and data elements, within a distributed hypermedia system applied to the development of web services.\nRestricted local operator services: communication services provided by an operator that involve either automated or human assistance (e.g. credit card billing, directory assistance, customer care) for which successful authentication is not necessary.\nservice information: set of information conveyed from the AF to the PCRF over the Rx interface to be used as a basis for PCC decisions at the PCRF, including information about the AF session (e.g. application identifier, type of media, bandwidth, IP address and port number).\nservice data flow: An aggregate set of packet flows.",

      "content": "The PCRF (Policy Control and Charging Rules Function) is a functional element that encompasses policy control decision and flow based charging control functionalities. These 2 functionalities are the heritage of the release 6 logical entities PDF and CRF respectively. The PCRF provides network control regarding the service data flow detection, gating, QoS and flow based charging (except credit management) towards the PCEF. The PCRF receives session and media related information from the AF and informs AF of traffic plane events.\nThe PCRF may check that the service information provided by the AF is consistent with the operator defined policy rules before storing the service information. The service information shall be used to derive the QoS for the service. The PCRF may reject the request received from the AF and as a result the PCRF shall indicate, in the response to the AF, the service information that can be accepted by the PCRF.\nThe PCRF may temporarily not be able to provide the service delivery that AF requested (e.g. due to RAN user plane congestion). In this case, the PCRF may send a re-try interval information to the AF. The re-try interval indicates when service delivery may be retried by the AF over Rx.\nNOTE 1:\tAdditionally, existing bandwidth limitation parameters (e.g. Max-Requested-Bandwidth-DL AVP, Max-Requested-Bandwidth-UL AVP within the Acceptable-Service-Info AVP) provided by the PCRF to the AF in AA-Answer command during the Rx session establishment are available in order to mitigate RAN user plane congestion.\nThe PCRF may use the subscription information as basis for the policy and charging control decisions. The subscription information may apply for both session based and non-session based services. The subscription specific information for each service may contain e.g. max QoS class and max bit rate.\nIf the AF requests it, the PCRF shall report IP-CAN session events (including bearer events and events on AF signalling transport) to the AF via the Rx reference point.\nThe PCRF PCC/QoS Rule decisions may be based on one or more of the following:\n-\tthe session and media related information obtained from the AF via the Rx reference point;\n-\tthe bearer and subscriber related information obtained from the PCEF over the Gx reference point;\n-\tthe bearer and subscriber related information obtained from the BBERF over the Gxx reference point;\n-\tsubscriber and service related data the PCRF may be aware of by configuration or through the Sp reference point;\n-\tpre-configured information in the PCRF.\nNOTE 2:\tThe details associated with the Sp reference point are not specified in this Release. The SPR’s relation to existing subscriber databases is not specified in this Release.\nThe PCRF shall provision PCC/QoS Rules to the PCEF/BBERF via the Gx/Gxx reference point.",

      "content": "When a new AF session is being established and media information for this AF session is available at the AF and the related media require PCC supervision, the AF shall open an Rx Diameter session with the PCRF for the AF session using an AA-Request command, unless an Rx session has already been established for the AF session (e.g. as per clause 4.4.6.7). If an Rx Diameter session already exists for the AF session, the AF uses the existing Rx Diameter session. The AF shall provide the full IP address of the UE using either Framed-IP-Address AVP or Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP, and the corresponding Service Information within Media-Component-Description AVP(s). The AF shall not include circuit-switched bearer related media in the service information sent to the PCRF. The AF shall indicate to the PCRF as part of the Media-Component-Description whether the media IP flow(s) should be enabled or disabled with the Flow-Status AVP.\nNOTE 1:\tThe AF does not need to open an Rx Diameter session with the PCRF, if the SDP payload is only proposing to use a circuit-switched bearer (i.e. \"c=\" line set to \"PSTN\" and an \"m=\" line set to \"PSTN\", refer to 3GPP TS 24.292 [26]).\nNOTE 2:\tThe Rx Diameter session used for an AF session is different from the Rx Diameter session possibly used for the notifications of the status of the AF signalling transmission path. A new Rx Diameter session is established for each new AF session.\nThe AF may include the AF-Application-Identifier AVP into the AA-Request in order to indicate the particular service that the AF session belongs to. This AVP can be provided at both AF session level, and Media-Component-Description level. When provided at both levels, the AF-Application Identifier provided within the Media-Component-Description AVP will have precedence. The AF may also include an AF application identifier within the AF-Application-Identifier AVP at the AF session level to trigger the PCRF to indicate to the PCEF/TDF to perform the application detection based on the operator’s policy as defined in 3GPP TS 29.212 [8].\nThe AF may include the AF-Charging-Identifier AVP into the AA-Request for charging correlation purposes. The AF may also include the Specific-Action AVP to request notification for certain user plane events, e.g. bearer termination.\nThe AF may include the Service-URN AVP in order to indicate that the new AF session relates to emergency or RLOS traffic and additionally it may include the AF-Requested-Data AVP to indicate the information required by the AF. If the PCRF receives the Service-URN AVP indicating an emergency session, the PCRF may apply special policies, for instance prioritising service flows relating to the new AF session or allowing these service flows free of charge. If the Service-URN AVP indicates that the new AF session relates to emergency traffic and the AF-Requested-Data AVP is received, the PCRF shall provide the requested available user information as part of the AA-Answer command.\nThe AF may include the MPS-Identifier AVP in order to indicate that the new AF session relates to an MPS session. If the PCRF receives the MPS-Identifier AVP indicating an MPS session, the PCRF may take specific actions on the corresponding IP-CAN to ensure that the MPS session is prioritized as specified in 3GPP TS 29.212 [8]. For Multimedia Priority Service handling for IMS, see Annex A.9.\nThe AF may include the MCPTT-Identifier AVP in order to indicate that the new AF session relates to an MCPTT session with priority call. If the PCRF receives the MCPTT-Identifier AVP related to that MCPTT session, the PCRF may take specific actions on the corresponding IP-CAN to ensure that the MCPTT session is prioritized. For the handling of MCPTT session with priority call, see Annex A.13.\nThe AF may include the MCVideo-Identifier AVP in order to indicate that the new AF session relates to an MCVideo session with priority call. If the PCRF receives the MCVideo-Identifier AVP related to that MCVideo session, the PCRF may take specific actions on the corresponding IP-CAN to ensure that the MCVideo session is prioritized. For the handling of MCVideo session with priority call, see Annex A.15.\nIf the QoSHint feature is supported by the AF, the AF may include the Desired-Max-Latency AVP and/or Desired-Max-Loss AVP within the Media-Component-Description AVP to indicate to the PCRF that the related application media has specific latency and/or loss demands.\nThe AF may include the FLUS-Identifier AVP within the Media-Component-Description AVP in order to indicate to the PCRF that the media flow(s) correspond to a FLUS media stream. Additional QoS information for the treatment of FLUS media may be provided within Desired-Max-Latency AVP and/or Desired-Max-Loss AVP.\nThe AF may include the Priority-Sharing-Indicator AVP set to PRIORITY_SHARING_ENABLED within the Media-Component-Description AVP in order to indicate to the PCRF that the related media flow is allowed to use the same Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP) as media flows belonging to other AF sessions as described in clause 4.4.8. In this case, if the MCPTT-Preemption is supported, the AF may also include the Pre-emption-Capability AVP containing the suggested pre-emption capability value and the Pre-emption-Vulnerability AVP containing the suggested pre-emption vulnerability value within the Media-Component-Description AVP for the PCRF to determine the ARP values. The AF may also include the Pre-emption-Control-Info AVP containing the pre-emption control information at the AAR command level for the PCRF to perform the pre-emption control as defined in clause 4.5.27 or 4a.5.17 of 3GPP TS 29.212 [8].\nThe AF may include the Sharing-Key-UL and/or Sharing-Key-DL AVP within the Media-Component-Description AVP in order to indicate that the related media of the new AF session may share resources with other media components in the related direction that include the same value for the Sharing-Key-UL AVP and/or Sharing-Key-DL AVP.\nWhen the AF is a GCS AS, it may include the GCS-Identifier AVP at command level and Reservation-Priority AVP at command level or media component level in order to indicate that the new AF session relates to a prioritized Group Communication session. Based on this information, the PCRF may take specific actions on the corresponding IP-CAN to ensure that the Group Communication session is prioritized as specified in 3GPP TS 29.212 [8].\nIf the AF provides service information that has been fully negotiated (e.g. based on the SDP answer), the AF may include the Service-Info-Status AVP set to FINAL_SERVICE_INFORMATION. In this case the PCRF shall authorize the session and provision the corresponding PCC/QoS rules to the PCEF/BBERF.\nThe AF may additionally provide preliminary service information not fully negotiated yet (e.g. based on the SDP offer) at an earlier stage. To do so, the AF shall include the Service-Info-Status AVP with the value set to PRELIMINARY SERVICE INFORMATION. Upon receipt of such preliminary service information, the PCRF shall perform an early authorization check of the service information. For GPRS, the PCRF shall not provision PCC rules towards the PCEF unsolicitedly. However, the PCRF may authorize a PCC/QoS rule request received from the PCEF/BBERF as per 3GPP TS 29.212 [8]. Further, if the AF requests the PCRF to report the access network information together with preliminary service information, the PCRF shall immediately configure the PCEF (or BBERF) to provide the access network information.\nFor sponsored data connectivity and if SponsoredConnectivity is supported, the AF shall provide the application service provider identity and the sponsor identity to the PCRF by including the Application-Service-Provider-Identity AVP and the Sponsor-Identity AVP in the Sponsored-Connectivity-Data AVP in the AA-Request. Additionally if SponsorChange is supported the AF shall provide an indication whether to enable or not enable sponsored data connectivity to the PCRF by including the Sponsoring-Action AVP set to the applicable value.\nNOTE 3:\tThe relationship between the AF and Sponsor is out of scope of this specification. A single AF can serve multiple ASPs and multiple sponsors, An ASP can also be a sponsor.\nTo support the usage monitoring of sponsored data connectivity, the AF may also include the Granted-Service-Unit AVP in the Sponsored-Connectivity-Data AVP and the Specific-Action AVP set to the value USAGE_REPORT in the AA-Request to request notification when the usage threshold has been reached.\nNOTE 4:\tIf the AF is in the user plane, the AF can handle the usage monitoring and therefore it is not required to provide a usage threshold to the PCRF as part of the sponsored data connectivity information.\nWhen SponsoredConnectivity is supported or when SponsorChange is supported and the AF indicated to enable sponsored data connectivity, the following procedures apply:\n-\tIf the UE is roaming with the visited access case and the AF is located in the HPLMN or roaming with the home routed case and operator policies do not allow accessing the sponsored data connectivity with this roaming case, the H-PCRF shall reject the service request indicating UNAUTHORIZED_SPONSORED_DATA_CONNECTIVITY to the AF.\n-\tIf the UE is roaming with the visited access case and the AF is located in the VPLMN, the V-PCRF shall reject the service request indicating UNAUTHORIZED_SPONSORED_DATA_CONNECTIVITY to the AF.\nWhen SponsoredConnectivity is supported or when SponsorChange is supported and the AF indicated to enable sponsored data connectivity, if the UE is in the non-roaming case or roaming with the home routed case and the operator policies allow accessing the sponsored data connectivity with this roaming case, the following procedures apply:\n-\tIf the PCEF/TDF does not support sponsored connectivity and the required reporting level for that service indicates a sponsored connectivity level according to 3GPP TS 29.212 [8], then the PCRF shall reject the request indicating REQUESTED_SERVICE_NOT_AUTHORIZED.\n-\tIf the PCEF/TDF supports sponsored data connectivity feature or the required reporting level is different from sponsored connectivity level as described in 3GPP TS 29.212 [8], then the PCRF, based on operator policies, shall check whether it is required to validate the sponsored connectivity data. If it is required, it shall perform the authorizations based on sponsored data connectivity profiles. If the authorization fails, the PCRF responds to the AF with an AA-Answer including the Experimental-Result-Code AVP set to the value UNAUTHORIZED_SPONSORED_DATA_CONNECTIVITY. The profile may include a list of Application Service Providers and their applications per sponsor.\nNOTE 5:\tIf the AF is in the operator’s network and is based on the OSA/Parlay-X GW, the PCRF is not required to verify that a trust relationship exists between the operator and the sponsors.\nWhen CHEM feature is supported, the AF includes the Max-PLR-DL AVP and/or Max-PLR-UL AVP within the Media-Component-Description AVP, to indicate the downlink maximum packet loss rate and/or uplink maximum packet loss rate for each payload type. For CHEM feature, see Annex A.18.\nWhen the PCRF receives an initial AA-Request from the AF, the PCRF shall perform session binding as described in 3GPP TS 29.213 [9]. To allow the PCRF to identify the IP-CAN session for which this request applies, the AF shall provide either the Framed-IP-Address or the Framed-Ipv6-Prefix containing the full IP address applicable to an IP flow or IP flows towards the UE. In case of private IP address being used, the AF may provide PDN information if available in the Called-Station-Id AVP for session binding. The AF may provide the domain identity in the IP-Domain-Id AVP for session binding.\nNOTE 6:\tThe IP-Domain-Id AVP is helpful in the following scenario: Within a PLMN, there are several separate IP address domains, with PCEF(s) that allocate Ipv4 IP addresses out of the same private address range to UEs. The same IP address can thus be allocated to UEs served by PCEFs in different address domains. If one PCRF controls several PCEFs in different IP address domains, the UE IP address is thus not sufficient for the session binding. An AF can serve UEs in different IP address domains, either by having direct IP interfaces to those domains, or by having interconnections via NATs in the user plane between PCEFs and the AF. If a NAT is used, the AF obtains the IP address allocated to the UE via application level signalling and supplies it for the session binding as Framed-IP-Address to the PCRF. The AF supplies an IP-Domain-Id value denoting the IP address domain behind the NAT in addition. The AF can derive the appropriate value from the source address (allocated by the NAT) of incoming user plane packets. The value provided in the IP-Domain-Id AVP is operator configurable.\nNOTE 7:\tWhen the scenario described in NOTE 6 applies and the AF is a P-CSCF it is assumed that the P-CSCF has direct IP interfaces to the different IP address domains and that no NAT is located between P-GW and P-CSCF. How a non-IMS AF obtains the UE private IP address to be provided to the PCRF is out of scope of the present release; it is unspecified how to support applications that use a protocol that does not retain the original UE’s private IP address.\nIf the PCRF fails in executing session binding, the PCRF responds to the AF with an AA-Answer including the Experimental-Result-Code AVP set to the value IP-CAN_SESSION_NOT_AVAILABLE. Further details on how the PCRF identifies suitable IP-CAN sessions can be found in the binding mechanism described in 3GPP TS 29.213 [9].\nIf the request contains Media-Component-Description Attribute-Value Pair(s) (AVP(s)) the PCRF shall store the received Service Information. The PCRF shall process the received Service Information according to the operator policy and may decide whether the request is accepted or not. The PCRF may take the priority information within the Reservation-Priority AVP into account when making this decision.\nFor an IP-CAN session associated to a dedicated APN for the purpose of offering services to remote UEs via a ProSe UE-to-network relay UE, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.303 [46], the PCRF shall validate the service information based on the service/roaming agreement and the operator policies related to that PDN information.\nNOTE 8:\tThe PCRF is not required to be aware of the remote UE.\nIf the service information provided in the AA-Request command is rejected (e.g. the subscribed guaranteed bandwidth for a particular user is exceeded), the PCRF shall indicate in the AA-Answer command the cause for the rejection with the Experimental-Result-Code AVP set to the value REQUESTED_SERVICE_NOT_AUTHORIZED. If the service information provided in the AA-Request command is rejected by the PCRF due to a temporary condition in the network (e.g. the user plane in the cell the user is located is congested), the PCRF may indicate in the AA-Answer the cause for the rejection with the Experimental-Result-Code AVP set to the value REQUESTED_SERVICE_TEMPORARILY_NOT_AUTHORIZED (4261). The PCRF may also provide a retry-interval within the Retry-Interval AVP in the AA-Answer command to the AF. When the AF receives the re-try interval within the Retry-Interval AVP, the AF shall not send the same service information to the PCRF again (for the same IP-CAN session) until the re-try interval has elapsed. The PCRF may additionally provide the acceptable bandwidth within the Acceptable-Service-Info AVP in AA-Answer command.\nNOTE 9:\tHow the PCRF derives the re-try interval is up to implementation.\nTo allow the PCRF and PCEF to perform PCC rule authorization and bearer binding for the described service IP flows, the AF shall supply both source and destination IP addresses and port numbers within the Flow-Description AVP, if such information is available.\nNOTE 10:\tIn SDP source port information is usually not available.\nThe AF may specify the ToS‑Traffic‑Class AVP for the described service data flows together with the Flow‑Description AVP.\nNOTE 11:\tThe ToS-Traffic-Class AVP can be useful when another packet filter attribute is needed to differentiate between flows. For example, (when EPS bearers are used for group communication services) flows encapsulated and encrypted by a tunneling protocol and thus having their IP five-tuple attributes obscured can be differentiated by the Type of Service (or Traffic Class) value of the outer header.\nNOTE 12:\tThe use of ToS‑Traffic‑Class AVP by the AF assumes that no DSCP re-marking is applied from the application to the PGW.\nThe AF may specify the Reservation-Priority AVP at request level in the AA-Request in order to assign a priority to the AF Session as well as specify the Reservation-Priority AVP at the media-component-description AVP level to assign a priority to the IP flow. The presence of the Reservation-Priority in both levels does not constitute a conflict as they each represent different types of priority. Specifically the Reservation-Priority at the AA-Request level provides the relative priority for a session while the Reservation-Priority at the media-component-description level provides the relative priority for an IP flow within a session. If the Reservation-Priority AVP is not specified the requested priority is DEFAULT (0).\nThe AF may request notifications of specific IP-CAN session events through the usage of the Specific-Action AVP in the AA-Request command. The PCRF shall make sure to inform the AF of the requested notifications in the event that they take place.\nThe AF may include the Rx-Request-Type AVP set to INITIAL_REQUEST in the AAR.\nThe AF may include a Reference Id within the Reference-Id AVP related to a transfer policy negotiated for background data transfer via the Nt reference point as described in 3GPP TS 29.154 [47]. The PCRF shall retrieve the corresponding transfer policy from the SPR based on the Reference Id. If the PCRF can not retrieve the transfer policy, the PCRF shall include in the AA-Answer the Service-Authorization-Info AVP with the bit 0 set to indicate that the transfer policy is unknown. If the time window of the received transfer policy has expired, the PCRF shall include in the AA-Answer the Service-Authorization-Info AVP with the bit 1set to indicate that the transfer policy has expired. Otherwise, if the time window of the received transfer policy has not yet occurred, the PCRF shall include in the AA-Answer the Service-Authorization-Info AVP with the bit 2 set to indicate that the time window of the transfer policy has not yet occurred.\nNOTE 13:\tIn the case that the PCRF can not retrieve the transfer policy or the transfer policy expired, the PCRF makes the decision without considering the transfer policy.\nNOTE 14:\tWhen receiving the reference id from the 3rd party SCS/AS as described in 3GPP TS 23.682 [40], the SCEF (acting as an AF) can provide the reference id together with the sponsored data connectivity information if SponsorChange is supported as described in this clause.\nThe AF may include the IMS-Content-Type AVP into the AA-Request in order to indicate the type of IMS communication service (e.g. CAT service, 3PTY conference) the AF session refers to.\nThe AF may include the IMS-Content-Identifier AVP into the AA-Request in order to indicate the particular IMS communication service or communication dialogue that the AF session refers to.\nThe AF may include the Calling-Party-Address AVP and the Callee-Information AVP into the AA-Request in order to indicate the caller and the callee information that the AF session refers to.\nThe PCRF shall check whether the received Service Information requires PCC/QoS Rules to be created and provisioned and/or authorized QoS to be provisioned as specified in 3GPP TS 29.213 [9]. Provisioning of PCC/QoS Rules and Authorized QoS to the PCEF/BBERF shall be carried out as specified at 3GPP TS 29.212 [8].\nIf the Sharing-Key-UL AVP and/or Sharing-Key-DL AVP are provided within the Media-Component-Description AVP, the PCRF may apply the mechanisms for resource sharing as specified at 3GPP TS 29.212 [8].\nThe PCRF shall reply with an AA-Answer to the AF. The acknowledgement towards the AF should take place before or in parallel with any required PCC Rule provisioning towards the PCEF and shall include the Access‑Network-Charging-Identifier(s) and may include the Access-Network-Charging-Address AVP, if they are available. The AA-Answer message shall also include the AN-GW-Address AVP, if the PCRF has previously requested to be updated with this information in the PCEF. The AA-Answer message shall also include the PLMN identifier within the 3GPP-SGSN-MCC-MNC AVP if the PCRF has previously requested to be updated with this information in the PCEF/BBERF. The AA-Answer message shall also include the IP-CAN-Type AVP. if the PCRF has previously requested to be updated with this information in the PCEF/BBERF. In that case, the AA-Answer message shall also include the RAT type information within the RAT-Type AVP and AN-Trusted AVP when applicable for the specific IP-CAN Type. In addition, if IP flow mobility applies to service data flows as specified in 3GPP TS 29.212 [8], such that a subset of the flows within the AF session are affected, the PCRF shall also include IP-CAN-type and RAT type information (if applicable) to IP flow mobility related flows, if such information is available. The IP flow mobility affected service data flows are included within the Flows AVP at command level. If the PCRF needs to terminate the Rx session before it has sent the AA Answer, the PCRF shall send the AA Answer immediately and before the AS Request.\nThe behaviour when the AF does not receive the AA Answer, or when it arrives after the internal timer waiting for it has expired, or when it arrives with an indication different than DIAMETER_SUCCESS, are outside the scope of this specification and based on operator policy.\nIf the PCRF fails in installing PCC/QoS rules based on the provided service information due to resource allocation failure as specified in 3GPP TS 29.212 [8] and if requested by the AF, the PCRF shall send an RAR command to the AF with the Specific-Action AVP set to the value INDICATION_OF_FAILED_RESOURCES_ALLOCATION to report the resource allocation failure, the Flows AVP containing the service data flows corresponding to the resources that could not be allocated, and the content version within the Content-Version AVP if it was included when the corresponding media component was provisioned. The AF shall send an RAA command to acknowledge the RAR command.",

The procedures to update the Authorized QoS for the affected IP-CAN bearer are also specified at 3GPP TS 29.212 [8].\nIf the Sharing-Key-UL AVP and/or Sharing-Key-DL AVP are provided within the Media-Component-Description AVP, the PCRF may apply the mechanisms for resource sharing as specified at 3GPP TS 29.212 [8].\nThe PCRF shall reply with an AA-Answer to the AF. The acknowledgement towards the AF should take place before or in parallel with any required PCC Rule provisioning towards the PCEF and shall include the Access‑Network-Charging-Identifier(s) and may include the Access-Network-Charging-Address AVP, if they are available at this moment and have not been yet supplied earlier to the AF. The AA-Answer message shall include the AN-GW-Address AVP if the PCRF has previously requested to be updated with this information in the PCEF. The AA-Answer message shall also include the PLMN identifier within the 3GPP-SGSN-MCC-MNC AVP if the PCRF has previously requested to be updated with this information in the PCEF/BBERF. The AA-Answer message shall also include the IP-CAN-Type AVP if the PCRF has previously requested to be updated with this information in the PCEF/BBERF . In that case, the AA-Answer message shall also include the RAT type information within the RAT-Type AVP and AN-Trusted AVP when applicable for the specific IP-CAN Type. In addition, if IP flow mobility applies to service data flows as specified in 3GPP TS 29.212 [8], such that a subset of the flows within the AF session are affected, the PCRF shall also include IP-CAN-type and RAT type information (if applicable) to IP flow mobility related flows, if the PCRF has previously requested to be updated with this information in the PCEF. The IP flow mobility affected service data flows are included within the Flows AVP at command level. If the PCRF needs to terminate the Rx session before it has sent the AA Answer, the PCRF shall send the AA Answer immediately and before the AS Request. If the PCRF does not have an existing session for the Rx session being modified (such as after a PCRF failure), the PCRF may reject the request with an AA-Answer with the result code set to DIAMETER_UNKNOWN_SESSION_ID.\nIf the PCRF installs PCC/QoS rules or modifies existing PCC/QoS rules based on the updated service information and the installation or modification fails due to resource allocation failure as specified in 3GPP TS 29.212 [8] and if requested by the AF, the PCRF shall send an RAR command to the AF with the Specific-Action AVP set to the value INDICATION_OF_FAILED_RESOURCES_ALLOCATION to report the modification failure, the Flows AVP containing the service data flows corresponding to the resources that could not be allocated, and the content version(s) within the Content-Version AVP(s) if it was included when the corresponding media component was provisioned. If the modification of the existing PCC/QoS rules fails, the PCRF may also provide the status of the service information within the Media-Component-Status AVP. The AF shall send an RAA command to acknowledge the RAR command.\nNOTE 6:\tThe PCRF will report the Media-Component-Status AVP according to the status reported for the related PCC/QoS rules when the modification fails over the Gx/Gxx reference points as described in 3GPP TS 29.212 [8].",

      "content": "The Supported-Features AVP is used during session establishment to inform the destination host about the required and optional features that the origin host supports. The client shall, in the first request of a Diameter session indicate the set of supported features. The server shall, in the first answer within the Diameter session indicate the set of features that it has in common with the client and that the server shall support within the same Diameter session. Any further command messages shall always be compliant with the list of supported features indicated in the Supported-Features AVPs during session establishment. Features that are not advertised as supported shall not be used to construct the command messages for that Diameter session. Unless otherwise stated, the use of the Supported-Features AVP on the Rx reference point shall be compliant with the requirements for dynamic discovery of supported features and associated error handling on the Cx reference point as defined in clause 7.2.1 of 3GPP TS 29.229 [25].\nThe base functionality for the Rx reference point is the 3GPP Rel-7 standard and a feature is an extension to that functionality. If the origin host does not support any features beyond the base functionality, the Supported-Features AVP may be absent from the Rx commands. As defined in clause 7.1.1 of 3GPP TS 29.229 [25], when extending the application by adding new AVPs for a feature, the new AVPs shall have the M bit cleared and the AVP shall not be defined mandatory in the command ABNF.\nAs defined in 3GPP TS 29.229 [25], the Supported-Features AVP is of type grouped and contains the Vendor-Id, Feature-List-ID and Feature-List AVPs. On the Rx reference point, the Supported-Features AVP is used to identify features that have been defined by 3GPP and hence, for features defined in this document, the Vendor-Id AVP shall contain the vendor ID of 3GPP (10415). If there are multiple feature lists defined for the Rx reference point, the Feature-List-ID AVP shall differentiate those lists from one another.\nOn receiving an initial request application message, the destination host shall act as defined in clause 7.2.1 of 3GPP TS 29.229 [25]. The following exceptions apply to the initial and stateless AAR/AAA command pair:\n-\tIf the AF supporting post-Rel-7 Rx functionality is able to interoperate with a PCRF supporting Rel-7, the AAR shall include the features supported by the AF within Supported-Features AVP(s) with the ‘M’ bit cleared. Otherwise, the AAR shall include the supported features within the Supported-Features AVP(s) with the M-bit set.\nNOTE 1:\tOne instance of Supported-Features AVP is needed per Feature-List-ID.\n-\tIf the AAR command does not contain any Supported-Features AVP(s) and the PCRF supports Rel-7 Rx functionality, the AAA command shall not include the Supported-Features AVP. In this case, both AF and PCRF shall behave as specified in the Rel-7 version of this document.\n-\tIf the AAR command contains the Supported-Features AVP(s), the PCRF shall include the Supported-Features AVP(s) in the AAA command, with the ‘M’ bit cleared, indicating only the features that both the PCRF and AF support. In this case, the PCRF should not use the 'M' bit setting of the Supported-Features AVP(s) to determine if the AAR is accepted or rejected.\nNOTE 2:\tThe client will always declare all features that are supported according to table 5.4.1.1. When more than one feature identifying a release is supported by both AF and PCRF, the AF will work according to the latest common supported release.\nOnce the PCRF and AF have negotiated the set of supported features during session establishment, the set of common features shall be used during the lifetime of the Diameter session.\nThe table below defines the features applicable to the Rx interfaces for the feature list with a Feature-List-ID of 1.\nTable 5.4.1.1: Features of Feature-List-ID 1 used in Rx\nFeature bit\nFeature\nM/O\nDescription\n0\nRel8\nM\nThis feature indicates the support of the base 3GPP Rel-8 functionality, including the AVPs and corresponding procedures supported by the base 3GPP Rel-7 Rx standard, but excluding those features represented by separate feature bits.

The service information shall be derived both from the SDP offer and the SDP answer. This ensures that the PCRF receives proper information to perform media authorization for all possible IMS session set-up scenarios, and that the PCRF is also capable of handling session modifications. The P-CSCF may include the Service-Info-Status AVP with the value set to FINAL_SERVICE_INFORMATION.\nAdditionally, the P-CSCF may send service information to the PCRF when receiving a SIP message that includes an SDP offer payload for the purpose of performing an early bandwidth authorization check, or for enabling pre-authorization for a UE terminated IMS session establishment or modification with UE initiated resource reservation, or for the retrieval of network provided access network information (see clause A.10.2). The P-CSCF shall send service information to the PCRF when receiving a SIP message that includes an SDP offer payload when the IMS session is an MPS session that requires priority treatment. For a UE terminated session the P-CSCF may send the service information derived from the SDP offer when the SDP offer either does not include any preconditions information or includes preconditions information indicating that the local preconditions (i.e. the preconditions related to the remote peer) are already met. In this case, the P-CSCF shall derive the service information only from the SDP offer and shall include the Service-Info-Status AVP with the value set to PRELIMINARY SERVICE INFORMATION.\nNOTE 1:\tFor a UE terminated session setup, when the SDP offer either does not include any preconditions information or includes preconditions information indicating that the local preconditions (i.e. the preconditions related to the remote peer) are already met, the terminating UE can request a resource modification prior to sending the SDP answer. Even if the IP address and port information in the session information derived from the SDP offer can be insufficient for PCC rule authorization, the policy to handle such UE initiated requests at the PCRF can take into account the fact that an IMS session establishment is ongoing, for instance in deciding whether to authorize the request and in selecting an appropriate charging key and a gating policy.\nThe P-CSCF shall derive Flow-Description AVP within the service information from the SDP as follows:\n-\tAn uplink Flow-Description AVP shall be formed as follows: The destination address shall be taken from the SDP information received by the P-CSCF in downlink direction, while the source IP address may be formed from the address present in the SDP received by the P-CSCF in uplink direction (taking into account only the 64 bit prefix of the Ipv6 address) Source and destination ports shall be derived according to rules provided in 3GPP TS 29.213 [9] clause 6.2.\nEXAMPLE 1:\tAssuming UE A sends an SDP to UE B, the PCRF of UE B uses the address present in this SDP for the destination address of UE B’s uplink Flow-Description AVP, while the PCRF of the UE A uses the 64 bit prefix of the same address for the source address of UE A’s uplink Flow‑Description AVP. If the source address is not formed from the 64 bit prefix, the source address shall be wildcarded.\n-\tA downlink Flow-Description AVP shall be formed as follows: The destination address shall be taken from the SDP information received by the P-CSCF in uplink direction, while the source IP address may be formed (in order to reduce the possibilities of bearer misuse) from the destination address in the SDP received by the P-CSCF in downlink direction (taking into account only the 64 bit prefix of the Ipv6 address) Source and destination ports shall be derived according to rules provided in 3GPP TS 29.213 [9] clause 6.2.\nEXAMPLE 2:\tAssuming UE A sends an SDP to UE B, the PCRF of UE A uses the address present in this SDP for the destination address of UE A’s downlink Flow-Description AVP, while the PCRF of UE B uses the 64 bit prefix of the same address for the source address of UE B’s downlink Flow‑Description AVP. If the source address is not formed from the 64 bit prefix, the source address shall be wildcarded.\nThe P-CSCF shall derive the bandwidth information within the service information, from the \"b=AS\" SDP parameter and \"a=bw-info\" SDP parameter, if available and if the E2EMTSIQOS feature is supported. If \"a=bw-info\" is used for bandwidth derivation, the P-CSCF shall use the SDP attribute line that contains the bandwidth properties for the IP version used by the UE, as detailed in 3GPP TS 29.213 [9] clause 6.2. If the received \"a=bw-info\" SDP attribute line(s) contain only bandwidth properties for an IP version that is not used by the UE, the P-CSCF shall re-compute the bandwidth properties for the used IP version and use that value for the bandwidth derivation as defined in 3GPP TS 26.114 [41].\nNOTE 2:\tIf no IP version is included for any of the \"a=bw-info\" SDP attribute lines related to a certain payload type and direction then IPv6 is assumed for all bandwidth properties related to the same direction and payload type, on all of the related \"a=bw-info\" SDP attribute lines, see clause 19 of 3GPP TS 26.114 [41].\nIf \"a=bw-info\" is used for bandwidth derivation and it includes both known and unknown bandwidth properties, the P-CSCF shall only consider the known bandwidth properties to derive the bandwidth information and ignore the unknown ones. If the\" a=bw-info\" line is received with an unknown directionality, then the entire \"a=bw-info\" line shall be ignored.\nFor the possibly associated RTCP IP flows, the P-CSCF shall use the SDP \"b=RR\" and \"b=RS\" parameters, if present, as specified in 3GPP TS 29.213 [9] clause 6.2. The \"b=AS\", \"b=RR\" and \"b=RS\" parameters in the SDP contain all the overhead coming from the IP-layer and the layers above, e.g. IP, UDP, RTP and RTCP payload, or IP, UDP and RTCP.\nFor multiplexed RTP/RTCP flows (as negotiated using the\"a=rtcp-mux\" SDP attribute defined in IETF RFC 5761 [42], a P-CSCF supporting RTP/RTCP transport multiplexing shall derive the bandwidth information within the service information as specified in 3GPP TS 29.213 [9] clause 6.2.\nHowever, if service information is received containing the \"b=TIAS\" SDP parameter that corresponds to an SDP answer payload, and if the P-CSCF supports this parameter, the P-CSCF may derive the bandwidth from this parameter rather than from the \"b=AS\" SDP parameter, as detailed in 3GPP TS 29.213 [9] clause 6.2.\nWhen available, the P-CSCF shall also indicate to PCRF, as a complement to the Service Information, the IMS Communication Service Identifier within the AF-Application-Identifier AVP. The originating P-CSCF shall take the IMS Communication Service Identifier value from the SIP response. The terminating P-CSCF shall take the IMS Communication Service Identifier value from the SIP request. Otherwise, the P-CSCF may not be able to provide an IMS Communication Service Identifier value to the PCRF. The format and specific headers where IMS communication service identifiers are transported within SIP are defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 [17].\nNOTE 3:\tIn order to indicate the IMS Communication Service Identifier to the PCRF, the originating P-CSCF sets the AF-Application-Identifier AVP to the ICSI contained in the topmost occurance of the \"+g.3gpp.icsi-ref\" header field parameter of the Feature-Caps header field(s) of 18x or 2xx SIP response (Feature-Caps: *;+g.3gpp.icsi-ref=”urn%Aurn-7%A3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mmtel”) and the terminating P-CSCF sets the AF-Application-Identifier AVP to the ICSI of the P-Asserted-Service header information received in the SIP request (e.g. P-Asserted-Service: urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mmtel). Since the headers and the format of the ICSI can vary depending on the case, the PCRF has to be prepared to accept the complete ICSI information received in different formats, as described in clause 7.2A.8.2 in 3GPP TS 24.229 [17].\nAdditionally, the P-CSCF may include the Sharing-Key-DL AVP and/or Sharing-Key-UL AVP within the Media-Component-Description AVP in order to indicate the PCRF that resource sharing should apply for the media components in the related direction with the same value for the Sharing-Key-DL AVP and/or Sharing-Key-UL AVP.\nAdditionally, if PrioritySharing feature is supported, the P-CSCF may provide the Priority-Sharing-Indicator AVP within the Media-Component-Description AVP as described in clause 4.4.47.\nNOTE 4: \tThe P-CSCF obtains this information from the Application Server as described in 3GPP TS 23.228 [16], clause 5.4.7.9.\nNOTE 5:\tRTCP flows are not subject to resource sharing. This requirement cannot be met for multiplexed RTP/RTCP flows as in this case there is no mechanism in the current release to distinguish between RTP and RTCP flows.\nIf the Service-URN AVP does not include an emergency service URN, i.e. a top-level service type of \"sos\" as specified in IETF RFC 5031 [21] and possibly additional sub-service information on the type of the emergency service and the PCRF binds the IMS service session to an IP-CAN session established to an Emergency APN, the PCRF shall return an AAA command with Experimental-Result-Code AVP set to the value UNAUTHORIZED_NON_EMERGENCY_SESSION to the P-CSCF. Upon receiving an AAA with Experimental-Result-Code AVP set to the value UNAUTHORIZED_NON_EMERGENCY_SESSION the P-CSCF shall apply the procedures defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 [17].\nNOTE 6:\tThe PCRF determines whether an IP-CAN session is established to an Emergency APN based on the information received over Gx and operator configuration.\nIf the AF-Requested-Data AVP is provided in the AA-Request command indicating \"EPC-level Identities required\", the PCRF shall provide the available user information for the IP-CAN session within the Subscription-Id AVP (s) and/or User-Equipment-Info AVP or User-Equipment-Info-Extension AVP if the User-Equipment-Info-Extension feature is supported.\nThe PCRF may decide not to authorize requested service information. The PCRF will indicate it to the P-CSCF by sending an AA-Answer with Experimental-Result-Code AVP set to the value REQUESTED_SERVICE_NOT_AUTHORIZED. Upon receiving an AA-Answer with Experimental-Result-Code AVP set to the value REQUESTED_SERVICE_NOT_AUTHORIZED the P-CSCF shall apply the procedures defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 [17].\nA.2\tEnabling of IP Flows\nA.2.0\tGeneral\nPrior to the completion of the SIP session set-up, i.e. until the 2xx response to the INVITE request is received, the P-CSCF may enable or disable media IP flows depending on operator policy, thus allowing or forbidding early media in forward and/or backward direction. The P-CSCF may set the values of the Flow-Status AVPs derived from the SDP direction attributes as defined in 3GPP TS 29.213 [9] clause 6.2 or set the values of the Flow-Status AVPs considering the em-param of the P-Early-Media header field according to clause A.2.1 or downgrade the values of the Flow-Status AVPs derived from the SDP direction attribute based on the configuration in the P-CSCF according to clause A.2.2. However for multiplexed RTP/RTCP flows (as negotiated using the \"a=rtcp-mux\" SDP attribute defined in IETF RFC 5761 [42]), a P-CSCF supporting RTP/RTCP transport multiplexing shall set the Flow-Status set to \"ENABLED\" to prevent that RTCP is blocked. If the P-CSCF chooses to modify the values of the Flow-Status AVPs as received from the SDP direction attribute, the P-CSCF shall store the last received SDP.\nWhen a 2xx response is received, the P-CSCF shall enable all media IP flows according to the direction attribute within the last received SDP, as specified in 3GPP TS 29.213 [9] clause 6.2. When a 2xx response is received and the P-CSCF previously provided the values of the Flow-Status AVPs different from the value derived from the SDP direction attribute in the session information, the P-CSCF shall provide service information with values of the Flow-Status AVPs corresponding to the last received SDP.\nNOTE:\tIn most cases a 2xx response is a 200 (OK) response.\nIf the P-CSCF receives SDP answers after the completion of the SIP session set-up, i.e. after the 2xx response to the INVITE request is received, the P-CSCF shall provide the Flow-Status AVP, based on the last received SDP answer. The Flow-Status AVP shall be derived from the SDP according to 3GPP TS 29.213 [9] clause 6.2.\nA.2.1\tGate control procedures considering the P-Early-Media header field\nPrior to the completion of the SIP session set-up, the P-CSCF may use the em-param of the P-Early-Media header field defined in IETF RFC 5009 [48] in order to enable or disable early media in forward and/or backward direction. If the P-CSCF uses the em-param of the P-Early-Media header field for the gate control of early media, the P-CSCF shall perform the following procedures.\nIn the terminating P-CSCF, when a SIP message with the P-Early-Media header field is received from the UE and the policies configured in the P-CSCF indicate that the UE is authorized to send early media, then:\n1)\tthe P-CSCF shall set the Flow-Status AVP to \"ENABLED\" if:\n-\tthe received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field includes \"sendrecv\" and the last received SDP direction attribute from the UE is \"sendrecv\" or no SDP direction attribute has been received; or\n2)\tthe P-CSCF shall set the Flow-Status AVP to \"ENABLED-UPLINK\" if:\n-\tthe received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field includes \"sendrecv\" and the last received SDP direction attribute from the UE is \"sendonly\"; or\n-\tthe received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field includes \"sendonly\" and the last received SDP direction attribute from the UE is \"sendrecv\" or \"sendonly\" or no SDP direction attribute has been received; or\n3)\tthe P-CSCF shall set the Flow-Status AVP to \"ENABLED-DOWNLINK\" if:\n-\tthe received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field includes \"sendrecv\" and the last received SDP direction attribute from the UE is \"recvonly\"; or\n-\tthe received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field includes \"recvonly\" and the last received SDP direction attribute from the UE is \"sendrecv\" or \"recvonly\" or no SDP direction attribute has been received; or\n4)\tthe P-CSCF shall set the Flow-Status AVP to \"DISABLED\" if either the received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field or the last received SDP direction attribute from the UE includes \"inactive\"; or\n5)\tthe P-CSCF may set the Flow-Status AVP to \"DISABLED\" or apply the rules defined in clause A.2.2 if the received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field includes \"sendonly\" or \"recvonly\" and the last received SDP direction attribute from the UE is \"recvonly\" or \"sendonly\" respectively.\nNOTE 1:\tIf the UE is authorized to send early media, the P-CSCF will not remove or modify the P-Early-Media header field according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [17].\nWhen a SIP message with the P-Early-Media header field is received from the functional entity within the trust domain, and if:\n-\tthe P-Early-Media header field includes the \"gated\" parameter, then the P-CSCF may decide not to perform the gate control of early media; or\n-\tthe P-Early-Media header field does not include the \"gated\" parameter, then the P-CSCF shall perform the following procedures:\n1)\tthe P-CSCF shall set the Flow-Status AVP to\"ENABLED\" if:\n-\tthe received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field includes \"sendrecv\" and the last received SDP direction attribute from the functional entity is \"sendrecv\" or no SDP direction attribute has been received; or\n2)\tthe P-CSCF shall set the Flow-Status AVP to \"ENABLED-DOWNLINK\" if:\n-\tthe received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field includes \"sendrecv\" and the last received SDP direction attribute from the functional entity is \"sendonly\"; or\n-\tthe received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field includes \"sendonly\" and the last received SDP direction attribute from the functional entity is \"sendrecv\" or \"sendonly\" or no SDP direction parameter has been received; or\n3)\tthe P-CSCF shall set the Flow-Status AVP to \"ENABLED-UPLINK\" if:\n-\tthe received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field includes \"sendrecv\" and the last received SDP direction attribute from the functional entity is \"recvonly\"; or\n-\tthe received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field includes \"recvonly\"and the last received SDP direction attribute from the functional entity is \"sendrecv\" or \"recvonly\" or no SDP direction parameter has been received ; or\n4)\tthe P-CSCF shall set the Flow-Status AVP to \"DISABLED\" if either the received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field or the last received SDP direction attribute from the functional entity includes \"inactive\"; or\n5)\tthe P-CSCF may set the Flow-Status AVP to \"DISABLED\" or apply the rules defined in clause A.2.2 if the received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field includes \"sendonly\" or \"recvonly\" and the last received SDP direction attribute from the functional entity is \"recvonly\" or \"sendonly\" respectively.\nNOTE 2:\tAccording to IETF RFC 5009 [48], the non-direction parameter \"gated\" can be included after the direction parameter (e.g. \"sendrecv\") in the parameter list. The proxy performing gating of early media can add the parameter before forwarding the SIP message.\nWhen a SIP message without the P-Early-Media header field is received from either the functional entity within the trust domain or the UE that is authorized to send early media, then the P-CSCF may set the Flow-Status AVP to \"DISABLED\" or apply the rules defined in clause A.2.2 or apply the rules defined in 3GPP TS 29.213 [9] clause 6.2.\nNOTE 3:\tAs indicated in IETF RFC 5009 [48] the applicable preconditions need to be met in order to allow early media in a particular direction.\nWhen a SIP message is received from the functional entity other than the functional entity within the trust domain or the UE that is authorized to send early media, then the P-CSCF shall not use the received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field and may apply the rules defined in clause A.2.2 or apply the rules defined in 3GPP TS 29.213 [9] clause 6.2.\nNOTE 4:\tThe P-CSCF will remove or modify the P-Early-Media header field in the above case.\nA.2.2\tGate control procedures based on the configuration in the P-CSCF\nPrior to the completion of the SIP session set-up, the P-CSCF may downgrade the values of the Flow-Status AVPs derived from the SDP direction attributes based on the configuration in the P-CSCF. If the P-CSCF has the configuration for the gate control of early media, the P-CSCF shall perform the following procedures.\nNOTE:\tThe gate control of early media can be  configured in the P-CSCF per UE basis.\nWhen the Flow-Status AVP derived from the SDP direction attribute is \"ENABLED\", then the P-CSCF may downgrade the value of the Flow-Status AVP to the value \"DISABLED\", \"ENABLED_UPLINK\", or \"ENABLED_DOWNLINK\" based on the configuration in the P-CSCF.\nWhen the Flow-Status AVP derived from the SDP direction attribute is \"ENABLED_UPLINK\" or \"ENABLED_DOWNLINK\", then the P-CSCF may downgrade the value of the Flow-Status AVP to the value \"DISABLED\" based on the configuration in the P-CSCF.\nA.3\tSupport for SIP forking\nA.3.0\tGeneral\nThe P-CSCF shall be able to handle forking when PCC is applied. Forking can occur as specified in 3GPP TS 23.228 [16]. The related UE procedures are described in 3GPP TS 24.229 [17].\nA.3.1\tPCC rule provisioning for early media for forked responses\nWhen a SIP session has been originated by a connected UE, the P-CSCF may receive multiple provisional responses due to forking before the first final answer is received. Multiple early media session may be established during this process.\nThe UE and the P-CSCF become aware of the forking only when a subsequent provisional response arrives for a new early dialogue. After the first early media session is established, for each subsequent provisional response establishing an additional early media session,, the P-CSCF shall use an AA request within the existing Diameter session containing the SIP-Forking-Indication AVP with value SEVERAL_DIALOGUES and include the service information derived from the latest provisional response.\nThe P-CSCF shall also provision the service information derived from any subsequent SDP offer-answer exchange within an early dialogue (e.g. in PRACK and OK(PRACK), or UPDATE and OK(UPDATE) ) using an AA request within the existing Diameter session containing the SIP-Forking-Indication AVP with value SEVERAL_DIALOGUES and the derived service information.\nWhen receiving an AA request containing the SIP-Forking-Indication AVP with value SEVERAL_DIALOGUES, the PCRF shall identify the existing authorization information for that AF session. The PCRF shall send additional PCC Rules or individual service data flow filters to already provide PCC rules as required by the Flow Description AVPs within the session information to the PCEF. The PCRF shall authorize any additional media components and any increased QoS requirements for the previously authorized media components, as requested within the service information. The PCRF shall authorize the maximum bandwidth required by any of the dialogues, but not the sum of the bandwidths required by all dialogues. Thus, the QoS authorized for a media component is equal to the highest QoS requested for that media component by any of the forked responses. The PCRF shall open or close the gates for service flows depending on the flow status that is being provisioned. However, if a flow ID has been enabled in uplink or downlink direction or both way within previous service information, it shall remain enabled even if the PCRF receives service information that disable this flow ID within an AA request containing the SIP-Forking-Indication AVP with value SEVERAL_DIALOGUES.\nIf the P-CSCF provides one or more Media-Component-Description AVP with the Flow-Status AVP set to \"REMOVED\" for previously authorized media component(s) the media component shall remain as authorized and the PCRF shall not take any action on that media component(s).\nNOTE:\tThere can be cases where a forked response could not support some of the media components included in the SDP Offer (e.g. when early session disposition SDP as described in Annex A.7 applies, the forked response related to the early session could include the port set to zero for those media components not related to the early session or when a subsequent SDP Offer-Answer to indicate that some media is disabled). For those cases the P-CSCF will indicate the PCRF about the removal of the corresponding media component. However this media component is already supported by other UEs and the PCRF needs to maintain the corresponding PCC rules until the final SDP answer is received in the P-CSCF in order to avoid the release of resources in the network.\nA.3.2\tUpdating the provisioned PCC rules at the final answer\nThe P-CSCF shall store the SDP information for each early dialogue separately till the first final SIP answer is received. Then the related early dialogue is progressed to an established dialogue to establish the final SIP session. All the other early dialogues are terminated. The service information for the SIP session is updated to match the requirements of the remaining early dialogue only.\nWhen receiving the first final SIP response, the P-CSCF shall send an AA request without the SIP-Forking-Indication AVP and include the service information derived from the SDP corresponding to the dialogue of the final response. The P-CSCF shall provision the full service information including the applicable Flow-Description AVP(s) and Flow-Status AVP(s).\nWhen receiving an AA request with no SIP-Forking-Indication AVP or with a SIP-Forking-Indication AVP with value SINGLE_DIALOGUE, the PCRF shall update installed PCC Rules information and Authorized-QoS information to match only the requirements of the service information within this AA request. The PCRF should immediately remove PCC Rule(s) or individual service data flow filters not matching IP flow(s) in the updated Service Information, to reduce the risk for initial clipping of the media stream, and to minimize possible misuse of resources. The PCRF shall also open or close the gates for service flows according to the flow status in the received service information.\nA.4\tNotification of AF Signalling Transmission Path Status\nWhen the P-CSCF receives an initial REGISTER SIP message from an attached UE, the P-CSCF may subscribe to notifications of the status of the AF Signalling transmission path using the procedures specified in clause 4.4.5. Once the P-CSCF has subscribed, the P-CSCF may receive notifications from the PCRF according to clause 4.4.6.3.\nNOTE 1:\tWhen the Standardised QCI characteristics as defined in 3GPP TS 23.203 [2] are followed, the QCI for IMS signalling will correspond to a non-GBR bearer. In this case, the P-CSCF will not receive notifications related to the Specific-Action with value \"INDICATION_OF_LOSS_OF_BEARER\".\nNOTE 2: This procedure is not applicable for IMS registrations for Emergency sessions.\nThe P-CSCF shall cancel the subscription to notification of the status of the AF Signalling transmission path when the AF Signalling to that particular user is terminated (i.e. when the user is de-REGISTERED from the IM CN subsystem).\nWhen the P-CSCF receives a notification of loss of signalling connectivity from the PCRF, the P-CSCF shall behave as defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 [17].\nA.5\tIndication of Emergency Registration and Session Establishment\nWhen the P-CSCF receives an initial REGISTER SIP message for an IMS emergency registration or an INVITE SIP message for an emergency session and the P-CSCF determines that there are no IMS-level roaming interfaces, the P-CSCF may request the PCRF to provide the EPC-level identities (MSISDN, IMSI, IMEI(SV)) available for that IP-CAN session using the procedure as specified in this clause (for an IMS emergency registration) or A.1 (for an IMS emergency session establishment). An P-CSCF may request the PCRF to provide the EPC-level identities (MSISDN, IMSI, IMEI(SV)) available for that IP-CAN session when no service information is available in the AF.To do so, the P-CSCF shall open an Rx Diameter session with the PCRF for the AF signalling using an AA-Request command. The P-CSCF shall provide the UE’s IP address (using either the Framed-IP-Address AVP or the Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP) and the AF-Requested-Data AVP set to \"EPC-level identities required\". The AF shall include the Service-URN AVP set to the value \"sos\", in order to indicate that the new AF session relates to emergency traffic that is not related to a specific emergency service.\nWhen the PCRF receives an AA-Request command as described in the preceding paragraphs from the P-CSCF, the PCRF shall perform session binding as described in 3GPP TS 29.213 [9]. When the PCRF receives the Service-URN AVP indicating an emergency session, the PCRF may apply special policies, for instance prioritising service flows relating to the AF session or allowing these service flows free of charge. When the Service-URN AVP indicates that the AF session relates to emergency traffic and the AF-Requested-Data AVP is received indicating \"EPC-level Identities required\", the PCRF shall provide the requested available user information (MSISDN, IMSI) for the IP-CAN session within the Subscription-Id AVP(s) and/or the IMEI(SV) within the User-Equipment-Info AVP or the User-Equipment-Info-Extension AVP if the User-Equipment-Info-Extension feature is supported, in the AA-Answer command.\nWhen the P-CSCF receives the AA-Answer with the EPC-level identities from the PCRF, the P-CSCF stores the information received within the Subscription-Id AVP(s) and/or User-Equipment-Info AVP or User-Equipment-Info-Extension AVP if the User-Equipment-Info-Extension feature is supported, provided by the PCRF and behaves as defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 [17].\nNOTE:  \tThe user information received within the User-Equipment-Info AVP or the User-Equipment-Info-Extension AVP if the User-Equipment-Info-Extension feature is supported, and/or Subscription-Id AVP(s) can be used to support PSAP callback functionality for anonymous IMS emergency sessions. See 3GPP TS 23.167 [53] for further information.\nThe P-CSCF may decide to terminate the Rx session at any time. In that case, the AF shall use a Session-Termination-Request (STR) command to the PCRF, which shall be acknowledged with a Session-Termination-Answer (STA) command.\nA SIP INVITE request can contain a service URN as defined in IETF RFC 5031 [21] within the request URI. If the service within this URN is \"sos\", possibly with additional sub-service information, the P-CSCF shall provision this service and sub-service information within the Service-URN AVP towards the PCRF. The P-CSCF may also provision possible information about other services received within the service URN.\nA.6\tNotification IP-CAN Type Change\nWhen the P-CSCF receives an initial REGISTER SIP message or an INVITE SIP message from an attached UE, the P-CSCF may request from the PCRF the information about the type of IP-CAN the UE is attached to using the procedure specified in clause 4.4.1.\nNOTE 1:\tThis procedure is not applicable for IMS registrations for Emergency sessions.\nNOTE 2:\tThe P-CSCF can request information about the type of IP-CAN as part of the SIP session setup when it is only interested in the related information when the IMS session is ongoing.\nIf the P-CSCF requests information about the type of IP-CAN, the P-CSCF shall also subscribe within the same AAR command operation to notifications for changes of the IP-CAN type used by the UE. The P-CSCF shall include a Specific-Action AVP in the AAR that is set to the value of IP-CAN_CHANGE.\nWhen the P-CSCF receives the AA-Answer or RA-Request from the PCRF, the P-CSCF stores the IP-CAN type information received within the IP-CAN-Type AVP and the RAT type information received within the RAT-Type AVP and AN-Trusted AVP (if also provided by the PCRF) and behaves as defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 [17].\nThe P-CSCF may receive notifications for changes of the IP-CAN type from the PCRF according to clause 4.4.6.4. When the P-CSCF receives a notification of the change of the IP-CAN used by the UE, the P-CSCF stores the new IP-CAN type information and RAT type information and behaves as defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 [17].\nNOTE 3:\tThe subscription to receive information about the type of IP-CAN will be cancelled when the corresponding Rx session is terminated by the AF (i.e. when the UE is de-REGISTERED or the related SIP call is torn down).\nA.7\tSupport for Early Session disposition SDP\nA.7.1\tGeneral\nAs a network option, the P-CSCF may support the PCC procedures in the present Clause to handle \"early session\" disposition type SDP, as standardised in IETF RFC 3959 [27].\nA.7.2\tService Information Provisioning for Early Media\nThe P-CSCF can receive \"early session\" disposition SDP in addition to \"session\" disposition SDP in SIP early dialogues.\nThe P-CSCF shall then provision service information derived both from the \"early session\" disposition SDP and \"session\" disposition SDP applying the procedures in Clauses A.1, A.2, and A.3, and in the present Clause.\nThe P-CSCF shall apply the mapping rules in Annex B.1.2.2.2 to derive the flow identifiers from \"early session\" disposition SDP.\nIf a single media line with one media type (e.g. \"audio\" or \"video\") is contained in \"early session\" disposition SDP and a single media line with the same media type is contained in the \"session\" disposition SDP of the same SIP dialogue, and both media lines describe service flows of the same directionality (uplink, downlink, or bidirectional), the P-CSCF should describe those SDP media lines in the same session information media component (with the same flow ID).\nThe \"early session\" disposition SDP can also contain media lines of a type not included in the \"session\" disposition SDP, or several media lines of the same type. Such media components shall be described in own media components in the service information.\nIf the P-CSCF desires to invoke special policies or separate event notifications for an \"early session\" disposition media line, it may choose to provision a separate session information media component even if a media line with the same media type and directionality is contained in \"session\" disposition SDP.\nNOTE 1:\tA PCRF is then likely to supply separate PCC rules for early media and the corresponding final media. This may lead to an over provisioning of resources during call establishment and a subsequent reconfiguration of the radio bearer, or even to a call failure if the extra resources are not authorized or available.\nIf the P-CSCF receives \"early session\" disposition SDP before any \"session\" disposition SDP and supplies service information derived from the \"early session\" disposition SDP at this point of time, it shall use dedicated media components relating only to the \"early session\" disposition SDP in the service information.\nNOTE 2:\tThe \"session\" disposition SDP offer will frequently occur before the \"early session\" disposition SDP offer, but can also occur in parallel or in exceptional cases afterwards. The \"session\" disposition SDP answer can be contained in the same SIP message as the \"early session\" disposition SDP offer, or can be sent in a 200 OK (INVITE), i.e. after the \"early session\" disposition SDP answer.\nIf the P-CSCF includes any media component relating both to \"early session\" disposition SDP and \"session\" disposition SDP in the service information, the P-CSCF shall:\n-\tprovision the service information derived from \"early session\" disposition SDP and the service information derived from \"session\" disposition SDP in separate Rx AA-Requests, and shall send a new Rx AA-Request only after any previous Rx AA-Request has been acknowledged; and\n-\tprovision the first service information (either derived from \"early session\" disposition SDP or \"session\" disposition SDP) without the SIP-Forking-Indication AVP, or with the SIP-Forking-Indication AVP with value SINGLE_DIALOGUE; and\n-\tprovision all subsequent service information during ongoing call establishment with the SIP-Forking-Indication AVP with value SEVERAL_DIALOGUES; and\n-\tif an SDP answer has been received and Codec-Data AVPs are provisioned within a Media-Component-Description AVP, provision a Codec-Data AVP derived from the corresponding offer together with a Codec-Data AVP derived from the SDP answer.\nNOTE 3:\tThe P-CSCF needs to provision the service information derived from \"early session\" disposition SDP and the service information derived from \"session\" disposition SDP in separate Rx AA-Requests because the encoding of the media-component does not allow for the simultaneous provisioning of two corresponding filters.\nNOTE 4:\tThe PCRF will treat service information containing the SIP-Forking-Indication AVP as described in Clause A.3.\nA.7.3\tUpdating the Provisioned Service Information when Dialogue is established\nThe P-CSCF shall store the SDP information for the \"session\" disposition type until the first final SIP answer is received. Then the early media described in the \"early session\" disposition type SDP are terminated.\nThe P-CSCF shall then update the service information to match the requirements of the media described in the \"session\" disposition type SDP only:\n-\tIf the P-CSCF included any media component relating both to \"early session\" disposition SDP and \"session\" disposition SDP in the service information, the P-CSCF shall send an AA request without the SIP-Forking-Indication AVP or with a SIP-Forking-Indication AVP with value SINGLE_DIALOGUE and shall include the service information derived from the \"session\" disposition SDP. The P-CSCF shall provision the full service information including the applicable Flow-Description AVP(s) and Flow-Status AVP(s).\n-\tThe P-CSCF shall disable any media component(s) in the service information that relate to early media only by setting their flow status to \"removed\".\nA.8\tProvision of Signalling Flow Information at P-CSCF\nWhen the P-CSCF has successfully concluded the initial registration of an attached UE, i.e., when the P-CSCF has sent to the UE a SIP 200 (OK) response to the SIP REGISTER request, the P-CSCF may provision information about the SIP signalling flows between the UE and itself using the procedure specified in clause 4.4.5A. If the P-CSCF already has an open Rx Diameter session with the PCRF related to the signalling with the UE, e.g. one that has been opened according to the procedure described in clause A.6 and/or in clause A.4, the P-CSCF shall reuse the already open session to provision the SIP Signalling IP Flow information.\nNOTE: This procedure is not applicable for IMS registrations for Emergency sessions.\nIf the P-CSCF provisions information about SIP signalling flows, the P-CSCF shall ensure that for each signalling IP flow information it provides, the Flow-Description AVP shall accurately reflect the IP flow information as seen in the IP header ‘on the wire’. The P-CSCF shall set the value of the AF-Signalling-Protocol AVP to ‘SIP’.\nWhen the P-CSCF de-registers the UE and terminates SIP Signalling to the UE, the P-CSCF shall de-provision the SIP Signalling IP flow information from the PCRF as described in clause 4.4.5A.\nA.9\tHandling of MPS Session\nWhen the P-CSCF receives an authorised Resource-Priority header field or a temporarily authorised Resource-Priority header field containing an appropriate namespace and priority value in SIP signaling, and recognizes the need for priority treatment as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [17], the P-CSCF shall include the MPS-Identifier AVP and Reservation-Priority AVP in the AAR command towards the PCRF. The MPS-Identifier AVP shall contain the national variant for MPS service name indicating an MPS session. The Reservation-Priority AVP shall include the priority value of the related priority service. The Reservation-Priority AVP shall be populated with a default value if the priority value is unknown.\nNOTE 1:\tVarious mechanisms can be applied to recognize the need for priority treatment in the P-CSCF (e.g., based on the dialled digits), according to national regulation and network configuration, as stated in 3GPP TS 24.229 [17].\nNOTE 2:\tLowest user priority value is mapped in the corresponding lowest enumerated value of the Reservation-Priority AVP.\nIf the P-CSCF supports the Diameter message priority mechanism for an MPS session, it shall include the DRMP AVP towards the PCRF as described in 3GPP TS 29.213 [9], Annex J.\nNOTE 3:\tIf the P-CSCF supports the Diameter message priority mechanism for an MPS session, it includes the DRMP AVP with a priority value equivalent to the Reservation-Priority AVP priority value. Highest user priority value is mapped in the corresponding lowest enumerated value of the DRMP AVP.\nUpon reception of a request that requires MPS treatment, the PCRF shall derive the PCC/QoS Rules corresponding to the MPS session, as appropriate. The PCRF shall take specific actions on the corresponding IP-CAN to ensure that the MPS session is prioritized, as described in 3GPP TS 29.212 [8], clause 4.5.19.1.3.\nWhen the P-CSCF terminates the MPS session, the PCRF shall delete the PCC/QoS Rules corresponding to the MPS session. The PCRF shall revoke the actions related to the prioritization of the MPS session in the corresponding IP-CAN, as described in 3GPP TS 29.212 [8], clause 4.5.19.1.3.\nA.10\tRetrieval of network provided location information\nA.10.1\tGeneral\nAccording to Annex E.7 of 3GPP TS 23.228 [16], the P-CSCF can use PCC to retrieve network provided location information. Information flows related to the distribution of network provided location information within the IMS are provided in Annex R of 3GPP TS 23.228 [16].\nThis sublause provides optional PCC procedures to support the retrieval of network provided location information.\nThe originating P-CSCF can, depending on operator policy, retrieve the user location and/or UE Time Zone information either before sending the INVITE or MESSAGE towards the terminating side or upon reception of the SDP answer from the terminating side.\nThe terminating P-CSCF can, depending on operator policy, retrieve the user location and/or UE Time Zone information either upon reception of a SIP INVITE or upon reception of a SIP response.\nThe originating and terminating P-CSCF can, depending on operator policy, retrieve the user location and/or UE Time Zone information at mid call, e.g., when the P-CSCF learns about IP-CAN type change.\nA.10.2\tRetrieval of network provided location information at originating P-CSCF for inclusion in SIP Request\nIf the originating P-CSCF is required by operator policy to retrieve network provided location information before forwarding a SIP INVITE request, upon reception of an INVITE/UPDATE request, the P-CSCF shall send an AA-Request according to clause 4.4.1 (SIP INVITE request) or 4.4.2 (SIP INVITE/UPDATE request) including:\n-\tthe \"ACCESS_NETWORK_INFO_REPORT\" value within the Specific-Action AVP; and\n-\tthe required access network information within the Required-Access-Info AVP.\nIf the SIP INVITE request is an initial SIP INVITE request, the P-CSCF shall establish an Rx session for the new SIP session with the AA-Request according to clause 4.4.6.7 (if no session information is included) or 4.4.1 (if preliminary session information is included).\nThe P-CSCF will receive the access network information from the PCRF in an RAR, and should include this access network information in the SIP INVITE/UPDATE requests that it forwards. When the retrieved access network information corresponds to the TWAN-Identifier AVP, the P-CSCF may also map the retrieved access network information to a Geographical Identifier for routing, as specified in Annex E.8 of 3GPP TS 23.228 [16].\nA.10.3\tRetrieval of network provided location information at originating P-CSCF for inclusion in SIP response confirmation\nIf an originating P-CSCF is required by operator policy to retrieve network provided location information before forwarding an SDP answer, the P-CSCF shall apply the following procedures:\nUpon reception of an SDP offer, the P-CSCF may send an AA-Request to the PCRF according to clause A.1 and may include in this AA-request:\n-\tthe \"ACCESS_NETWORK_INFO_REPORT\" value within the Specific-Action AVP; and\n-\tthe required access network information within the Required-Access-Info AVP.\nUpon reception of an SDP answer, the P-CSCF will send an AA-Request to the PCRF according to clause A.1. If the P-CSCF has not requested access network information upon reception of the SDP offer, the P-CSCF shall include in this AA-request:\n-\tthe \"ACCESS_NETWORK_INFO_REPORT\" value within the Specific-Action AVP; and\n-\tthe required access network information within the Required-Access-Info AVP.\nThe P-CSCF will receive the access network information from the PCRF in an RAR, and should include this access network information in the SIP message with the response confirmation before forwarding it. When the retrieved access network information corresponds to the TWAN-Identifier AVP, the P-CSCF may also map the retrieved access network information to a Geographical Identifier for routing, as specified in Annex E.8 of 3GPP TS 23.228 [16].\nIf the originating P-CSCF is required by operator policy to retrieve network provided location information before forwarding a SIP MESSAGE request, upon reception of a MESSAGE request, the P-CSCF shall send an AA-Request including:\n-\tthe UE’s IP address (using either the Framed-IP-Address AVP or the Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP);\n-\ta Media-Component-Description AVP including a single Media-Sub-Component AVP with the Flow-Usage AVP set to the value \"AF_SIGNALLING\". The Media-Component-Description AVP shall contain the Media-Component-Number AVP set to \"0\". The Media-Sub-Component AVP shall contain the Flow-Number AVP set to \"0\", and the rest of AVPs within the Media-Component-Description and Media-Sub-Component AVPs shall not be used in this case;\n-\tthe \"ACCESS_NETWORK_INFO_REPORT\" value within the Specific-Action AVP; and\n-\tthe required access network information within the Required-Access-Info AVP.\nThe P-CSCF will receive the access network information from the PCRF in an RAR and should include this access network information in the SIP MESSAGE requests that it forwards. When the retrieved access network information corresponds to the TWAN-Identifier AVP, the P-CSCF may also map the retrieved access network information to a Geographical Identifier for routing, as specified in Annex E.8 of 3GPP TS 23.228 [16].\nIf the Rx Diameter Session is only used for retrieval of network provided location information, at reception of this information, the AF may terminate the AF session sending a Session-Termination-Request (STR) command to the PCRF, which shall be acknowledged with a Session-Termination-Answer (STA) command.\nA.10.4\tRetrieval of network provided location information at terminating P-CSCF\nIf a terminating P-CSCF is required by operator policy to retrieve network provided location information at session establishment and/or modification, the P-CSCF shall apply the following procedures:\nThe terminating P-CSCF may request network provided location information upon reception of a SIP INVITE request : in the following manner:\n-\tIf the SIP INVITE request is an initial SIP INVITE request, the P-CSCF shall establish an Rx session for the new SIP session with the AA-Request according to clause 4.4.6.7 (if no session information is included) or 4.4.1 (if preliminary session information is included).\n-\tIf the SIP INVITE includes an SDP offer, the P-CSCF shall send an AA-Request including:\n-\tthe \"ACCESS_NETWORK_INFO_REPORT\" value within the Specific-Action AVP;\n-\tthe required access network information within the Required-Access-Info AVP;\n-\tservice information derived from the SDP offer; and\n-\tthe Service-Info-Status AVP with the value set to PRELIMINARY SERVICE INFORMATION.\n-\tIf the SIP INVITE includes no SDP offer, the P-CSCF shall send an AA-Request including:\n-\tthe \"ACCESS_NETWORK_INFO_REPORT\" value within the Specific-Action AVP; and\n-\tthe required access network information within the Required-Access-Info AVP.\nUpon reception of a SIP response that requires the inclusion of access network information, if the P-CSCF has not already requested network provided location information upon reception of the corresponding SIP INVITE, the P-CSCF shall request network provided location information in the following manner:\n-\tIf an Rx session related to service data has not yet been established, the P-CSCF shall establish an Rx session for the new SIP session with the AA-Request according to clause 4.4.6.7 (if no session information is included) or 4.4.1 (if session information is included).\n-\tIf the SIP response includes an SDP answer, the P-CSCF will send an AA-Request to the PCRF according to clause A.1; the P-CSCF shall include in this AA-request:\n-\tthe \"ACCESS_NETWORK_INFO_REPORT\" value within the Specific-Action AVP; and\n-\tthe required access network information within the Required-Access-Info AVP.\n-\tIf the SIP response includes no SDP, the P-CSCF shall send an AA-Request including:\n-\tthe \"ACCESS_NETWORK_INFO_REPORT\" value within the Specific-Action AVP; and\n-\tthe required access network information within the Required-Access-Info AVP.\n-\tIf the SIP reponse includes an SDP offer, the P-CSCF shall send an AA-Request including:\n-\tthe \"ACCESS_NETWORK_INFO_REPORT\" value within the Specific-Action AVP;\n-\tthe required access network information within the Required-Access-Info AVP;\n-\tservice information derived from an SDP offer within the SIP response; and\n-\tthe Service-Info-Status AVP with the value set to PRELIMINARY SERVICE INFORMATION.\nThe P-CSCF will receive the access network information from the PCRF in an RAR, and should include this access network information in the appropriate SIP response before forwarding it. When the retrieved access network information corresponds to the TWAN-Identifier AVP, the P-CSCF may also map the retrieved access network information to a Geographical Identifier for routing, as specified in Annex E.8 of 3GPP TS 23.228 [16].\nIf the terminating P-CSCF is required by operator policy to retrieve network provided location information upon reception of a SIP MESSAGE response, the P-CSCF shall behave according to A.10.2.\nA.10.5\tProvisioning of network provided location information at SIP session release\nIf a P-CSCF is required by operator policy to include network provided location information in SIP session release signalling, the P-CSCF shall apply the following procedures:\nUpon reception of a SIP session release request that requires the inclusion of network provided location information, the P-CSCF will send an ST-Request and shall include in this request the required access network information within the Required-Access-Info AVP.\nThe P-CSCF will receive the access network information from the PCRF in the corresponding ST-Answer, and should include this access network information either in the SIP session termination request (at the originating side) or a reply to the SIP session termination request (at the terminating side). When the retrieved access network information corresponds to the TWAN-Identifier AVP, the P-CSCF may also map the retrieved access network information to a Geographical Identifier for routing, as specified in Annex E.8 of 3GPP TS 23.228 [16].\nA.10.6\tProvisioning of network provided location information at mid call\nIf a P-CSCF is required by operator policy to include network provided location information at mid call, the P-CSCF shall apply the following procedures:\nUpon reception of a trigger (e.g., when the P-CSCF learns about the access change) that requires the inclusion of network provided location information in a SIP message, the P-CSCF shall include in the AA-request:\n-\tthe \"ACCESS_NETWORK_INFO_REPORT\" value within the Specific-Action AVP;\n-\tthe required access network information within the Required-Access-Info AVP; and\n-\tthe service information related to the service according to clause 4.4.2.\nThe P-CSCF will receive the access network information from the PCRF in an RAR, and should include this access network information in the appropriate SIP message before forwarding it. When the retrieved access network information corresponds to the TWAN-Identifier AVP, the P-CSCF may also map the retrieved access network information to a Geographical Identifier for routing, as specified in Annex E.8 of 3GPP TS 23.228 [16].\nA.11\tHandling of RAN/NAS release cause values\nIf the P-CSCF is required by operator policy to provide the RAN/NAS release cause information, it includes this information in the corresponding SIP message as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [17] when received from the PCRF (see clause 4.4.4, 4.4.6.1, 4.4.6.2, 4.4.6.3 and 4.4.6.7).\nA.12\tResource Sharing\nThe P-CSCF may indicate to the PCRF that media of an AF session may share resources with media belonging to other AF sessions according to 3GPP TS 23.228 [16].\nIf the P-CSCF determines that resource sharing is possible, it may at establishment of a new AF session, include the Sharing-Key-UL AVP and/or Sharing-Key-DL AVP indicating that media resources may be shared in the related direction. The P-CSCF shall assign a distinct value for the Sharing-Key-UL AVP and/or Sharing-Key-DL AVP for each media component identified by the Media-Component-Description AVP for the AF session.\nNOTE 1:\tWhen resource sharing applies to both directions for a certain media component, the P-CSCF can assign the same value for Sharing-Key-UL AVP and Sharing-Key-DL AVP within the same media component.\nThe P-CSCF shall not include the Sharing-Key-UL AVP and/or Sharing-Key-DL AVP within the Media-Component-Description AVP when the AF session relates to an Emergency Session.\nThe PCRF shall not include the Sharing-Key-DL AVP and/or Sharing-Key-UL AVP for those PCC/QoS Rules related to the RTCP traffic.\nTrigger conditions that require applying or stopping resource sharing are described in 3GPP TS 24.229 [17].\nNOTE 2:\tWhen P-CSCF needs to stop sharing according to the procedures described in 3GPP TS 24.229 [17], the P-CSCF will provide new values for the Sharing-Key-UL AVP and/or Sharing-Key-DL AVP that are not being used by any other AF sessions for the same user.\nA.13\tHandling of MCPTT priority call\nA.13.1\tGeneral\nWithin the framework of MCPTT, when the SIP Core (3GPP TS 23.379 [54]) is implemented by an IMS core network, if the P-CSCF receives a SIP request message including a Resource-Priority header field with a namespace field and priority value defined for MCPTT for adjusting the priority of an MCPTT session, the P-CSCF shall provide the Reservation-Priority AVP and the MCPTT-Identifier AVP in the AA-Request command as defined in clause A.13.2 to allow the PCRF to set the corresponding PCC rule(s) according to the prioritized MCPTT service. Additionally, if PrioritySharing feature is supported, the P-CSCF may provide the Priority-Sharing-Indicator AVP within the Media-Component-Description AVP as described in clause A.1. For MCPTT the service priority and the priority sharing indicator are defined in 3GPP TS 23.379 [54].\nNOTE 1:\tThe process of adjusting priority may occur several times during the course of one session, e.g. a normal MCPTT group call elevated to an MCPTT emergency group call, returned to a normal priority MCPTT group call, elevated to an MCPTT imminent peril group call and returned to a normal priority MCPTT group call.\nNOTE 2:\tUpon reception of a request that requires the adjustment of the MCPTT priority, the PCRF is expected to derive the PCC Rules corresponding to the this MCPTT session, as appropriate according to operator policies.\nNOTE 3:\tThe PCRF can identify an MCPTT call using the IMS Communication Service Identifier specific to MCPTT, which is provided by the P-CSCF in the AF-Application-Identifier AVP in the AA-Request sent to PCRF.\nA.13.2\tDetermination of MCPTT priority parameter values\nWhen the P-CSCF receives an authorized Resource-Priority header field containing an appropriate namespace and priority value used for MCPTT in SIP signaling, the P-CSCF shall include the MCPTT-Identifier AVP and Reservation-Priority AVP in the AAR command towards the PCRF.\nThe MCPTT-Identifier AVP shall include the namespace defined for MCPTT as received within the Resource-Priority header field.\nNOTE:\tTwo different values are defined for the MCPTT-Identifier AVP, one for each namespace value defined for MCPTT (see  IETF RFC 8101 [45]).\nThe Reservation-Priority AVP shall contain the priority value of the Resource-Priority header; the lowest priority shall be mapped to to DEFAULT (0), the next after the lowest to PRIORITY-ONE (1), and so on up to the highest priority which shall be mapped to PRIORITY-FIFTEEN (15).\nAdditionally, when the P-CSCF receives information about priority sharing from an MCPTT server that supports simultaneous sessions and that needs to share a common priority for several MCPTT sessions and if PrioritySharing feature is supported, the P-CSCF may include the Priority-Sharing-Indicator AVP within the Media-Component-Description AVP in the AAR command. See 3GPP TS 23.379 [54] for further information.\nA.14\tNotification of PLMN Change\nWhen the P-CSCF receives an initial REGISTER SIP message from an attached UE, the P-CSCF may subscribe to notifications of PLMN ID changes corresponding to the PLMN where the UE is located using the procedure specified in clause 4.4.6.9.\nWhen the P-CSCF receives the AA-Answer or RA-Request from the PCRF, the P-CSCF stores the PLMN identifier received within 3GPP-SGSN-MCC-MNC AVP and behaves as defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 [17].\nThe P-CSCF shall cancel the subscription to notification for changes of the PLMN used by the UE when the user is de-registered from the IM CN subsystem.\nA.15\tHandling of MCVideo priority call\nA.15.1\tGeneral\nWithin the framework of MCVideo, when the SIP Core (3GPP TS 23.281 [61]) is implemented by an IMS core network, if the P-CSCF receives a SIP request message including a Resource-Priority header field with a namespace field and priority value defined for MCVideo for adjusting the priority of an MCVideo session, the P-CSCF shall provide the Reservation-Priority AVP and the MCVideo-Identifier AVP in the AA-Request command as defined in clause A.15.2 to allow the PCRF to set the corresponding PCC rule(s) according to the prioritized MCVideo service.\nNOTE 1:\tThe process of adjusting priority may occur several times during the course of one session, e.g. a normal MCVideo group call elevated to an MCVideo emergency group call and returned to a normal priority MCVideo group call, elevated to an MCVideo imminent peril group call and returned to a normal priority MCVideo group call.\nNOTE 2:\tUpon reception of a request that requires the adjustment of the MCVideo priority, the PCRF is expected to derive the PCC Rules corresponding to the this MCVideo session, as appropriate according to operator policies.\nNOTE 3:\tThe PCRF can identify an MCVideo call using the IMS Communication Service Identifier specific to MCVideo, which is provided by the P-CSCF in the AF-Application-Identifier AVP in the AA-Request sent to PCRF.\nA.15.2\tDetermination of MCVideo priority parameter values\nWhen the P-CSCF receives an authorized Resource-Priority header field containing an appropriate namespace and priority value used for MCVideo in SIP signaling, the P-CSCF shall include the MCVideo-Identifier AVP and Reservation-Priority AVP in the AAR command towards the PCRF.\nThe MCVideo-Identifier AVP shall include the namespace defined for MCVideo as received within the Resource-Priority header field.\nThe Reservation-Priority AVP shall contain the priority value of the Resource-Priority header; the lowest priority shall be mapped to to DEFAULT (0), the next after the lowest to PRIORITY-ONE (1), and so on up to the highest priority which shall be mapped to PRIORITY-FIFTEEN (15).\nA.16\tSupport for volume based charging of IMS services\nAs a network option, when VBC feature is supported, the P-CSCF may be able to indicate to the PCRF the establishment and termination of specific IMS communication services (e.g. CAT and voice calls, 3PTY conference) or the establishment and termination of different communication dialogues to separate parties. This enables PCC to apply different Policy and Charging control. During AF session establishment, the P-CSCF may include the IMS-Content-Identifier AVP and the IMS-Content-Type AVP in the AAR command towards the PCRF. The PCRF derives the PCC rules to categorise the service data flows by rating group or combination of rating group and service id.\nDuring AF session modification, the P-CSCF may include the IMS-Content-Identifier AVP and the IMS-Content-Type AVP in the AAR command towards the PCRF. The PCRF updates the PCC rules to categorise the service data flows by rating group or combination of rating group and service id.\nThe IMS-Content-Type AVP indicates the type of IMS content of a session component. The P-CSCF determines the type of IMS content as follows:\n-\tIf the SDP payload refers to the Customized Alerting Tones (CAT) service (i.e. SDP body contains a media-level \"a=content\" SDP attribute with a value \"g.3gpp.cat\" defined in 3GPP TS 24.182 [62]), the P-CSCF sets the IMS-Content-Type AVP with the value \"CAT\".\n-\tIf the SDP payload refers to the 3PTY conference service (i.e. SDP body contains an \"a=content\" media-level attribute line with value of \"g.3gpp.conf\" defined in 3GPP TS 24.147 [63]), the P-CSCF sets the IMS-Content-Type AVP with the value \"CONFERENCE\".\n-\tOtherwise, the P-CSCF sets the IMS-Content-Type AVP with the value \"NO_CONTENT_DETAIL\".\nThe IMS-Content-Identifier AVP contains information that identifies a particular IMS communication service or a particular communication dialogue in the IMS session. This information may be used by the PCRF to apply different charging characteristics to the different parties in a 3PTY conference scenario.\nAs a network option, if VBCLTE feature is further supported, the P-CSCF shall be able to indicate to the PCRF caller and callee information.\nDuring AF session establishment, the P-CSCF may include the Calling-Party-Address AVP and the Callee-Information AVP in the AAR command towards the PCRF. The PCRF derives the PCC rules including the information of caller and callee.\nDuring AF session modification, the P-CSCF may include the Callee-Information AVP in the AAR command towards the PCRF. The PCRF updates the PCC rules to categorise the service data flows by rating group or combination of rating group and service id.\nThe Calling-Party-Address AVP indicates the caller of the IMS service. The P-CSCF determines the caller as defined in clause 7.2.33 of 3GPP TS 32.299 [24].\nThe Callee-Information AVP indicates the callee of the IMS service. The P-CSCF determines the callee as follows:\n-\tThe Called-Party-Address holds the address of the party (Public User ID or Public Service ID) to whom the SIP transaction is posted in the context of an end-to-end SIP transaction as defined in clause 7.2.32 in 3GPP TS 32.299 [24].\n-\tThe Requested-Party-Address holds the address of the party (Public User ID or Public Service ID) to whom the SIP transaction was originally posted as defined in clause 7.2.176 in 3GPP TS 32.299 [24].\nNOTE:\tThis AVP is only applicable when the ATCF is collocated with the P-CSCF.\n-\tThe Called-Asserted-Identity holds the address or addresses (SIP URI and/or Tel URI) of the party (Public User ID or Public Service ID) of the finally asserted called party as defined in clause 7.2.31 of 3GPP TS 32.299 [24].\nA.17\tIndication of Restricted Local Operator Services Support\nRLOS is an optional feature supported in certain countries. Service requirements of RLOS are defined in 3GPP TS 22.101 [65] and the architectural requirements are defined in 3GPP TS 23.221 [66]. The RLOS stage 2 services description for the Evolved Packet System (EPS) is specified in 3GPP TS 23.401 [67]. The policy and charging control architecture is described in 3GPP TS 23.203 [2].\nRLOS may be supported as described in clause A.5 with the following differences:\n-\temergency registration is replaced by RLOS registration;\n-\temergency session is replaced by RLOS session;\n-\temergency traffic is replaced by RLOS traffic;\n-\tvalue \"sos\" is replaced by \"g.3gpp.rlos\";\n-\tUNAUTHORIZED_NON_RLOS_SESSION session is returned when the service-URN AVP does not include an RLOS value, and the PCRF binds the IMS session to an IP-CAN established to an RLOS APN;\n-\tRLOS services are not prioritized services; and\n-\tthe call back functionality is not required.\nA.18\tCoverage and Handoff Enhancements using Multimedia error robustness feature (CHEM)\nAs a network option, the P-CSCF may support the PCC procedures in the present clause to handle the Coverage and Handoff Enhancements using Multimedia error robustness feature (CHEM)\nNOTE 1:\tWhen the CHEM feature is supported, improved error robustness can be enabled by packet-loss handling procedures of the codec, codec mode, or codec configuration to avoid, delay, or reduce the need to handoff a terminal due to degradation in the media quality. Communicating the level of robustness of the media to the network enables the eNB to use this information to determine a threshold for when the terminal should be handed off to another cell, domain (circuit-switched vs. packet-switched), or radio access technology.\nWhen a session is initiated or modified the P-CSCF supporting the CHEM feature shall derive the Max-PLR-DL AVP and Max-PLR-UL AVP based on the PLR_adapt and maxe2e-PLR attribute values in both the SDP offer and/or SDP answer to determine the maximum tolerable end-to-end PLR budget distributed across the uplink and downlink in a media transport path as described in 3GPP TS 29.213 [9] clause 6.2.\nUpon reception of SDP offer and answer, P-CSCF should check whether a= PLR_adapt line is present in both SDP offer and answer to derive Max-PLR-DL and Max-PLR-UL AVP in Media-Component-Description AVP else downlink and uplink maximum packet loss are not included by AF.\nThe originating P-CSCF should derive Max-PLR-DL AVP to the maximum value of Max-PLR-DL among all the RTP payload types. For each RTP payload type Max-PLR-DL is computed as described in 3GPP TS 29.213 [9] clause 6.2.\n-\tIf maxe2e-PLR is included in the SDP offer then Max-PLR-DL for a payload type is derived as value of maxe2e-PLR in the SDP offer - maxUL-PLR in the SDP answer if present else the default value is ½ maxe2e-PLR value present in the SDP offer.\n-\tIf maxe2e-PLR is not included in the SDP offer then then Max-PLR-DL for a payload type is derived from the default value in end-to-end Maximum End-to-End Packet Loss Rate for the decoder of the RTP payload type as recommended in 3GPP TS 26.114 [41] clause X.1.2 for application layer redundancy or X.1.1 for partial redundancy - maxUL-PLR in the SDP answer if present else the default value is ½ default value in end-to-end Maximum End-to-End Packet Loss Rate for the decoder of the RTP payload type as recommended in 3GPP TS 26.114 [41].\nThe originating P-CSCF should derive Max-PLR-UL AVP to the maximum value of Max-PLR-UL among all the RTP payload types. For each RTP payload type Max-PLR-UL is computed as described in 3GPP TS 29.213 [9] clause 6.2.\n-\tIf maxe2e-PLR is included in the SDP answer then Max-PLR-UL for a payload type is derived as value of maxe2e-PLR in the SDP answer - maxDL-PLR in the SDP ANSWER if present else the default value is ½ maxe2e-PLR value present in the SDP answer.\n-\tIf maxe2e-PLR is not included in the SDP answer then then Max-PLR-UL for a payload type is derived as the ½ default value in end-to-end Maximum End-to-End Packet Loss Rate for the decoder of the RTP payload type as recommended in 3GPP TS 26.114 [41] clause X.1.2 for application layer redundancy or X.1.1 for partial redundancy.\nThe terminating P-CSCF should derive Max-PLR-DL AVP to the maximum value of Max-PLR-DL among all the RTP payload types. For each RTP payload type Max-PLR-DL is computed as described in 3GPP TS 29.213 [9] clause 6.2.\n-\tIf maxe2e-PLR is included in the SDP answer then Max-PLR-DL for a payload type is derived as value of value of maxDL-PLR in the SDP answer if present else the default value is ½ maxe2e-PLR value present in the SDP answer.\n-\tIf maxe2e-PLR is not included in the SDP answer then then Max-PLR-DL for a payload type is derived as the ½ default value in end-to-end Maximum End-to-End Packet Loss Rate for the decoder of the RTP payload type as recommended in 3GPP TS 26.114 [41] clause X.1.2 for application layer redundancy or X.1.1 for partial redundancy.\nThe terminating P-CSCF should derive Max-PLR-UL AVP to the maximum value of Max-PLR-UL among all the RTP payload types. For each RTP payload type Max-PLR-UL is computed as described in 3GPP TS 29.213 [9] clause 6.2.\n-\tIf maxe2e-PLR is included in the SDP offer then Max-PLR-UL for a payload type is derived as value of value of maxUL-PLR in the SDP answer if present else the default value is ½ maxe2e-PLR value present in the SDP offer.\n-\tIf maxe2e-PLR is not included in the SDP offer then then Max-PLR-UL for a payload type is derived as the ½ default value in end-to-end Maximum End-to-End Packet Loss Rate for the decoder of the RTP payload type as recommended in 3GPP TS 26.114 [41] clause X.1.2 for application layer redundancy or X.1.1 for partial redundancy.\nA.19\tHandling of a FLUS session\nIf the P-CSCF receives a SIP request that requires provisioning of service information to the PCRF, the \"FLUS\" feature is supported and an SDP attribute \"a=label:flus…\" is included in one or more of the received SDP media descriptions, the P-CSCF shall provide the string after \"a=label:\" starting with \"flus\" within the FLUS-Identifier AVP within the affected Media-Component-Description AVP(s) in the AA-Request to the PCRF.\nNOTE:\tDuring the first interaction with the PCRF, the P-CSCF does not know if the \"FLUS\" feature is supported by the PCRF. In this case the P-CSCF will include the information as if supported.\nIf additionally the P-CSCF receives the \"a=3gpp-qos-hint\" media-level SDP attribute in the SIP request, the P-CSCF shall provide the PCRF with the Desired-Max-Latency AVP and/or Desired-Max-Loss AVP as described in 3GPP TS 29.213 [9], clause 6.2.\nUpon receiving the information from the P-CSCF and if the \"FLUS\" feature is supported, the PCRF shall derive the QoS information as described in 3GPP TS 29.213 [9], clause 6.3.\nA.20\tQoS hint support for data channel media\nIf the P-CSCF receives a SIP request or SIP response that requires provisioning of a service information to the PCRF, the QoSHint feature is supported and an SDP attribute \"a=3gpp-qos-hint\" is included in one or more of the received data channel media descriptions, the P-CSCF may provide the Desired-Max-Latency AVP and/or Desired-Max-Loss AVP for each affected application media component within the Media-Component-Description AVP(s) in the AA-Request to the PCRF.\nNOTE:\tDuring the first interaction with the PCRF, the P-CSCF does not know if the QoSHint feature is supported by the PCRF. In this case the P-CSCF will include the information as if supported.\nUpon receiving the information from the P-CSCF and if the QoSHint feature is supported, the PCRF shall derive the QoS information as described in 3GPP TS 29.213 [9], clause 6.3.\nAnnex B (normative):Flow identifiers: Format definition and examples\nB.1\tFormat of a flow identifier\nB.1.1\tGeneral\nA flow identifier is expressed as a 2-tuple as follows:\n<The ordinal number of the position of the media component description in the SDI , The ordinal number of the IP flow(s) within the media component description assigned in the order of increasing downlink port numbers as detailed below >\nwhere both are numbered starting from 1. The encoding of the flow identifier is as indicated in 3GPP TS 24.008 [12].\nIf UE and AF share an algorithm for a given application, which guarantees that UE and AF assign the same ordinal number to each media component, the ordinal numbers of the IP Flows within a media component shall be assigned according to the following rules:\n-\tAll IP flow(s) or bidirectional combinations of two IP flow(s) within the media component, for which a downlink destination port number is available, shall be assigned ordinal numbers in the order of downlink destination port numbers.\n-\tAll IP flows, where no downlink destination port number is available, shall be assigned the next higher ordinal numbers in the order of uplink destination port numbers.\nThe ordinal number of a media component shall not be changed when the session description information is modified.\nIf no SDI with fixed and unique positions for media components is exchanged between UE and AF, the UE and AF may assign the ordinal numbers of the media components in another application-dependent algorithm which guarantees that UE and AF assign the same ordinal number to each media component.\nIf UE and AF do not share an algorithm for a given application, which guarantees that UE and AF assign the same ordinal number to each media component, the ordinal number of the media component shall be set to zero and the ordinal number of the IP flows shall be assigned according to the following rules:\n1.\tIf ordinal numbers for several IP flows are assigned at the same time, all uplink IP flows shall be assigned lower ordinal number than all downlink IP flows.\n2.\tIf ordinal numbers for several IP flows are assigned at the same time, all uplink and all downlink IP flows shall separately be assigned ordinal numbers according to increasing internet protocol number assigned by IANA (e.g. 6 for TCP and 17 for UDP)\n3.\tIf ordinal numbers for several IP flows are assigned at the same time, for each internet protocol with a port concept, all uplink and all downlink IP flows of this internet protocol shall separately be assigned ordinal numbers according to increasing port numbers.\n4.\tIf IP flows are removed from an existing session, the previously assigned binding info shall remain unmodified for the remaining IP flows.\n5.\tIf IP flows are added to an existing session, the previously assigned binding info shall remain unmodified and the new IP flows shall be assigned ordinal numbers following the rules 1. To 3., starting with the first previously unused ordinal number. The numbers freed in step 4. Shall not be reused.\nIf the IP flows correspond to AF signalling (e.g. SIP signalling IP Flows), and no IP flow information is provided both the ordinal number of the media component and the IP flows shall be set to zero. In the case when the IP flow information of the AF signalling is provided, the ordinal number of the media component will be set to zero, and the ordinal number(s) of the IP flows shall follow the rules set above for the case when the UE and AF do not share an algorithm for a given application.\nB.1.2\tDerivation of Flow Identifiers from SDP\nB.1.2.1\tStandard Procedure\nThe procedure in Table B.1.2.1.1 shall be applied for SDP of \"session\" disposition type within SIP and for all SDP outside SIP.\nTable B.1.2.1.1: Standard Procedure to derive Flow Identifiers from SDP\nThe ordinal number of the position of the media component\nThe ordinal number of the IP flow(s) within the media component description\nThe ordinal number of the position of the \"m=\" line in the SDP\nThe ordinal number of the IP flow(s) within the \"m=\" line assigned in the order of increasing downlink destination port numbers, if downlink destination port numbers are available.

are described in a single Rx service information media component, that Rx service information media component shall obtain the media component number derived from \"session\" disposition SDP following the rules in table B.1.2.1.1.\nOtherwise each media component shall obtain the ordinal number of the position of the \"m=\" line in the \"early session\" disposition SDP plus 1000 as media component

This functionality requires the support of NetLoc, NetLoc-Untrusted-WLAN and/or NetLoc-Trusted-WLAN supported features.\n-\tCommunication Failure reporting as described in clauses 4.4.4, 4.4.6.2 and 4.4.6.3. This functionality requires the support of RAN-NAS-Cause supported feature.\nAnnex E (normative):Interworking with 5GS via Rx interface\nE.1\tGeneral\nIn the 5GS the Rx reference point is defined between the the PCF and the AF. The relationship between the involved functional entities is depicted in figure E.1.1. The overall PCC architecture is depicted in clause 4 of 3GPP TS 29.513 [59].\nFigure E.1.1: Rx reference model in 5GS\n5GS supports an interworking with AFs via the Rx interface. Interworking with AFs related to existing IMS services is described in 3GPP TS 23.228 [16]. Interworking with AFs related to existing Mission Critical services is described in TS 23.280 [60]. The PCF in 5GS supports the corresponding Rx procedures and requirements defined in 3GPP TS 23.203 [2]. The stage 2 requirements for 5GS supporting Rx interface are described in 3GPP TS 23.503 [56].\nThe PCF exchanges PCC rules with the SMF over the N7 interface as specified in 3GPP TS 29.512 [57].\nSignalling flows related to the both Rx and N7 interfaces are specified in 3GPP TS 29.513 [59].\nThe generic mechanisms for interaction between the AF and the PCF are described in main clauses in this specification and with the following clarifications:\n-\tdescription of the PCRF and the PCEF applies to the PCF and the SMF respectively;\n-\tdescription of the SPR applies to the UDR;\n-\tBBERF is not applicable in 5GS;\n-\tan IP-CAN bearer in this specification shall be interpreted as a 5GS QoS flow;\n-\tan IP-CAN session in this specification shall be interpreted as a 5GS PDU session of type IP;\n-\tAPN is equivalent to DNN;\n-\tthe following values of the Specific-Action AVP defined in clause 5.3.13 are applicable only to a PCF: EPS_FALLBACK (17) and INDICATION_OF_REALLOCATION_OF_CREDIT (18);\n-\twhen the serving network is an SNPN and the serving network information is provided to the AF, the NID may optionally be part of the serving network identifier, as specified in clause E.5; and\n-\tthe 5G-RAN-NAS-Release-Cause AVP defined in clause 5.3.69 is applicable only to a PCF. When the RAN-NAS-Cause feature is supported, it encodes the 5GS RAN cause and/or NAS cause, when available.\nThe specific mechanisms for the interaction between the AF and the PCF are described in the subclauses below.\nE.2\tMapping table for IP-CAN types and Access types\nTable E.2-1 maps the values of the Access types and RAT types used for N7 interface in 3GPP TS 29.512 [58] with the values of the IP-CAN types and RAT types used in this specification.\nTable E.2-1: Mapping table for IP-CAN types and Access types values\nAccessType specified for N7, see 3GPP TS 29.571 [64] clause 5.4.3.1\nRatType specified for N7, see 3GPP TS 29.571 [64] clause 5.4.3.2\n(NOTE 1)\nRAT-Type, see 3GPP TS 29.212 [8] clause 5.3.31\nIP-CAN-Type, see 3GPP TS 29.212 [8] clause 5.3.27\nValue\nValue\nValue\nDescription\nValue\nDescription\n3GPP_ACCESS\nNR\n1006\nNR\n8\n3GPP-5GS\nEUTRA\n1004\nEUTRAN\nNBIOT\n1005\nEUTRAN-NB-IoT\nLTE-M\n1007\nLTE-M\nNR_U\n1008\nNR-U\nWB_E_UTRAN_LEO\n1011\nEUTRAN(LEO)\nWB_E_UTRAN_MEO\n1012\nEUTRAN(MEO)\nWB_E_UTRAN_GEO\n1013\nEUTRAN(GEO)\nWB_E_UTRAN_OTHERSAT\n1014\nEUTRAN(OTHERSAT)\nNB_IOT_LEO\n1021\nEUTRAN-NB-IoT(LEO)\nNB_IOT_MEO\n1022\nEUTRAN-NB-IoT(MEO)\nNB_IOT_GEO\n1023\nEUTRAN-NB-IoT(GEO)\nNB_IOT_OTHERSAT\n1023\nEUTRAN-NB-IoT(OTHERSAT)\nLTE_M_LEO\n1031\nLTE-M(LEO)\nLTE_M_MEO\n1032\nLTE-M(MEO)\nLTE_M_GEO\n1033\nLTE-M(GEO)\nLTE_M_OTHERSAT\n1034\nLTE-M(GEO)\nEUTRA_U\n1009\nEUTRAN-U\nNR_LEO\n1035\nNR(LEO)\nNR_MEO\n1036\nNR(MEO)\nNR_GEO\n1037\nNR(GEO)\nNR_OTHER_SAT\n1038\nNR(OTHERSAT)\nNR_REDCAP\n1039\nNR-REDCAP\nNR_EREDCAP\n1040\nNR-EREDCAP\nNON_3GPP_ACCESS\nWLAN\n0\nWLAN (NOTE 2)\n9\nNon-3GPP-5GS\nVIRTUAL\n1\nVIRTUAL\nTRUSTED_N3GA\n2\nTRUSTED-N3GA\nTRUSTED_WLAN\n0\nWLAN (NOTE 2)\nWIRELINE\n3\nWIRELINE\nWIRELINE_CABLE\n4\nWIRELINE-CABLE\nWIRELINE_BBF\n5\nWIRELINE-BBF\nNOTE 1:\tOther values of RAT Types specified in 3GPP TS 29.571 [64] and not shown in this table are not applicable to this specification.\nNOTE 2:\tWhen the received RAT Type in N7 indicates \"WLAN\", the AN-Trusted AVP set to \"Untrusted” indicates the access type is not trusted.
