This version of the specification includes the interworking for the Call Completion to Busy Subscriber (CCBS) service between the ISDN CCBS-ASE and MAP.\nThe MAP protocol for CCBS service is specified in GSM 09.02. The ISDN CCBS-ASE protocol is specified in ETS 300 356‑18. The ISDN CCBS-ASE protocol is also commonly referred to as the SSAP protocol in GSM 03.93. This specification clarifies the interworking within the HLR between these protocols for the Call Completion to Busy Subscriber (CCBS) service.\nClause 4 describes the mapping between MAP application layer messages and SSAP application layer messages.\nClause 5 describes the mapping between MAP message parameters and SSAP message parameters.\nClause 6 describes the dialogue handling on the SSAP interface.\nClause 7 describes the SCCP layer addressing for messages on the SSAP interface.",

The GSM network also uses these signalling procedures for CCBS without any changes. The ISDN CCBS ASE protocol is supported in GSM networks in the HLR A (originating network) and HLR B (destination network). Therefore no protocol interworking for ISDN CCBS-ASE is needed for the CCBS service between GSM networks and ISDN networks.\nIn GSM networks, the CCBS functionality is distributed across several network entities (see GSM 03.93) including the HLR, VLR, MSC and the MS. The HLR shall provide any necessary signalling interworking between the MAP protocol for call completion services on the MAP D-interface (between the VLR and the HLR) and ISDN CCBS-ASE protocol between the originating and destination networks.\nThe MAP protocol for CCBS service is specified in GSM 09.02.
