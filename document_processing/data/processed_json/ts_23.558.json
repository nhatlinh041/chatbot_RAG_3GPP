EAS(s) and the EES are contained within the EDN. The ECS provides configurations related to the EES, including details of the EDN hosting the EES. The UE contains AC(s) and the EEC. The EAS(s), the EES and the ECS can interact with the 3GPP Core Network. When SEAL notification management service is used, the EES and the ECS interact with the SEAL notification management server and the SEAL EEC interacts with SEAL Notification management client.\n6.2a\tArchitecture for Roaming support\n6.2a.1\tGeneral\nThis clause describes the architectures for roaming UEs. To support UEs that are roaming, the EEL uses ECSs provided in HPLMN and VPLMN. The EEC in the UE obtains edge enabler layer services from V-ECS and V-EES. EDGE-10 reference point is used between the H-ECS and the V-ECS. Two roaming models are supported for edge enabling applications:\n-\tLocal breakout (LBO)roaming architecture; and\n-\tHome routed (HR) roaming architecture.\nIn both architecture options, the EDN is located in the V-PLMN and is accessed via an LBO or HR-SBO session.\nNOTE:\tH-ECS, H-EES and V-ECS, V-EES can be provided by the same ECSP.\n6.2a.2\tLocal breakout roaming architecture: Local breakout to access H-ECS\nFigure 6.2a.2-1 shows the roaming architecture for enabling edge applications as the reference point representation when the local breakout (LBO) PDU Session is used for routing EDGE-4 traffic between the EEC and the H-ECS.\nFigure 6.2a.2-1: Architecture for enabling edge applications for local breakout roaming scenarios\n6.2a.3\tHome-routed EDGE-4 access to H-ECS\nFigure 6.2a.3-1 shows the roaming architecture for enabling edge applications as the reference point representation when the home routed (HR) PDU Session is used for routing EDGE-4 traffic between the EEC and the H-ECS.\nThe traffic toward the EDN of the VPLMN (i.e. EDGE-1 traffic and application data traffic) is not routed via the HPLMN while the traffic between the EEC and H-ECS is routed via VPLMN toward HPLMN. Such a local access to the EDN of the VPLMN in the scenario is supported when a home routed session breakout (HR-SBO) PDU Session is used as described in clause 6.7 of 3GPP TS 23.548 [20].\nFigure 6.2a.3-1: Architecture for enabling edge applications for home routed roaming scenarios\n6.2b\tArchitecture for Federation support\n6.2b.1\tGeneral\nThis clause describes the architecture for support of Federation. To support Federation, EDGE-10 reference point is used between the ECSs to exchange ECS profile and EDN configuration information.\nNOTE:\tECS profile of partner ECSs can be preconfigured in the ECS or can be configured by the OAM system. For cases where the preconfigured and OAM configured information is not sufficient or not available, the ECS may communicate with other ECSs, e.g. ECS with edge repository functionality, to obtain the information.\nIf the ECSP is required to support service provisioning for a certain EAS whose information is not within the pre-configuration or OAM configuration, the ECS can use Edge repository functions as defined in clause 6.3.4 to support ECS discovery via ECS-ER.\n6.2b.2\tArchitecture\nFigure 6.2b.2-1 shows the architecture for support of federation. EDGE-10 reference point is introduced between the ECSs. ECSs interfacing over EDGE-10 reference point can be provided by different or the same ECSP.\nEDGE-10 interface is used for exchange of EDN configuration information.\nWhen one of the ECS is enhanced as an edge repository (ECS-ER) as defined in clause 6.3.4, making it the center of information for edge deployments, the ECS-ER receives information about edge deployments from other ECSs and stores it. In such deployments, EDGE-10 interface is used both for exchanging of ECS profile during ECS discovery and for exchanging EDN configuration information during service provisioning information retrieval.\nFigure 6.2b.2-1: Architecture for Federation support\n6.2c\tArchitecture for enabling cloud applications with edge applications\nFigure 6.2c-1 illustrates the architecture for enabling cloud applications along with the edge applications.\nFigure 6.2c-1: Architecture for enabling cloud application with edge applications\nCloud application server (CAS) residing outside the EDN may need to interact with the EEL entities e.g. for service continuity. The CAS and EAS interaction is Application Data Traffic, which is out-of-scope of this specification.\n6.2d\tArchitecture for enabling cloud applications with edge applications, with CES support\nFigure 6.2d-1 illustrates the architecture for enabling cloud applications along with the edge applications, when CES is used.\nNOTE:\tEdge and cloud servers can utilize SEAL NM service but for simplicity such an interaction is not depicted in the figure.\nFigure 6.2d-1: Architecture for enabling cloud application with edge applications\nCloud Application Server (CAS) residing in the cloud DN may need to interact with the Cloud Enabler Server (CES) which is part of the EEL for interworking, e.g. for service continuity.

The service provisioning request includes the security credentials of the EEC received during EEC authorization procedure and may include the UE identifier such as GPSI, connectivity information, UE location, EEC service continuity support and AC profile(s) information. EEC may provide its desired ECSP identifier(s) in the service provisioning request based on EEC preference.\n2.\tUpon receiving the request, the ECS performs an authorization check to verify whether the EEC has authorization to perform the operation. The ECS may utilize the capabilities (e.g. UE location) of the 3GPP core network as specified in clause 8.10.2. If the UE serving PLMN identifier is not provided by the EEC in the connectivity information of the service provisioning request, the ECS may invoke the NEF monitoring event API as described in 3GPP TS 23.502 [43] and 3GPP TS 23.682 [17] to obtain the UE roaming status and serving PLMN identifier. If the UE is roaming, the ECS may use the serving PLMN identifier to determine the roaming partner ECS (i.e. V-ECS) information to be provided to the EEC in the service provisioning response. If AC profile(s) are provided by the EEC, and the Application group profile is not provided, the ECS identifies the EES(s) based on the provided AC profile(s) and the UE location.\nWhen Application group profile is provided in the request,\n-\tif the ECS-ER is not available, then\n-\tthe ECS identifies EES(s) based on the information contained in the request (e.g.AC profile, Application group profile, UE location);\n-\tif the ECS-ER is available, and:\n-\tEES information is not available corresponding to the Application Group ID, then the ECS identifies EES(s) and stores the identified EES(s)'s information and related Application group ID into the ECS-ER; or\n-\tEES information is available corresponding to the Application Group ID, then the ECS retrieves the EES (s) information corresponding to the Application Group ID from the ECS-ER.\nNOTE 2:\tIt is up to the ASP or the EES to determine validity of the application group.\nThe ECS may take Group Geographical Service Area information and KPI requirements of the AC to determine the EES(s) corresponding to the Application group ID.\nWhen neither Application group profile nor AC profiles(s) are provided, then:\n-\tif available, the ECS identifies the EES(s) based on the UE-specific service information at the ECS and the UE location;\n-\tECS identifies the EES(s) by applying the ECSP policy (e.g. based only on the UE location);\nFurthermore, the ECS may identify the EES based on the EEC service continuity support information and EES service continuity support information.\nNOTE 3:\tDetails of the UE-specific service information and how it is available at the ECS is out of scope.\nNOTE 4:\tBoth steps are evaluated prior to sending a response.\nIf desired ECSP identifier(s) is provided by the EEC, the ECS identifies the EES(s) to be sent in step 3 based on registered ECSP identifier in EES profile and the desired ECSP identifier(s).\nNOTE 5:\tFor EEC desired ECSP identifier usage, it is assumed that the ECSP providing the EES and PLMN operator are the same organization and an ECSP providing the EES (desired by the EEC) registers its EES in ECS provided by another ECSP based on service agreement to provide services to EEC.\nThe ECS also determines other information that needs to be provisioned, e.g. EDN connection information, EDN service area, EES endpoints (see details in Table 8.3.3.3.3-2).\nIf ECS does not identify any suitable EES(s) based on EDN configuration available at the ECS and UE's location, the ECS determines a partner ECS that may satisfy the requirements. Based on ECSP policy, the ECS may use preconfigured or OAM configured information about the partner ECSs or ECS discovery via ECS-ER as specified in clause 8.17.2.3 or both.\nIf required by the ECSP policies, the ECS may use service provisioning information retrieval procedure as specified in clause 8.17.2.4 to obtain service provisioning information from the partner ECS.\nNOTE 6:\tECSP policies can restrict sharing partner ECSP's information with the EEC.\nWhen the bundle EAS information is provided, then;\n-\tIf bundle EAS information includes EAS bundle identifier, the ECS identifies all the EES(s) providing the same EAS bundle identifier.\n-\tIf bundle EAS information includes a list of EASIDs, the ECS identifies the one or more EES which support all of the EASs within the same EDN based on the EDN information obtained in the EES profile.\n3.\tIf the processing of the request was successful, the ECS responds to the EEC's request with a service provisioning response. If the ECS has identified the relevant EES(s) information, the service provisioning response includes a list of EDN configuration information, e.g. EDN connection information, EDN service area, and the required information (e.g. URI, IP address) for establishing a connection to the EES (see details in Table 8.3.3.3.3-2).\nThe ECS may provide associated EES(s) information (one or more EES information) in the service provisioning response along with the bundle EAS information.\nIf the alternative ECS(s) has been identified in step 2, the ECS sends a successful response including the Redirect information element containing the list of ECS(s) configuration information indicating that alternative ECS(s) is available for service provisioning request. The response may include information such as DNN and S-NSSAI for roaming UEs to establish a PDU session with the ECS as specified in 3GPP TS 23.548 [20].\nIf the ECS is not provisioned with any EDN configuration information or is unable to determine either the EES information or the partner ECS information using the inputs in service provisioning request, UE-specific service information at the ECS or the ECSP's policy, the ECS shall reject the service provisioning request and respond with an appropriate failure cause.\nIf the service provisioning response contains a list of ECS configuration information, the EEC may initiate service provisioning procedure with one or more ECS(s) provided in the response. If the UE is roaming to a V-PLMN and the ECS configuration information includes V-PLMN ID in the list of Supported PLMN ID(s), the EEC establishes a connection with the V-ECS as specified in 3GPP TS 23.548 [20]. The connection with the V-ECS can be a HR-SBO PDU session or an LBO PDU session based on the information received from the ECS.\nIf the EDN configuration information includes an LADN DNN as an identifier for the EDN, the EEC considers the LADN as the EDN. Therefore, the service area of EDN is the LADN Service Area which can be discovered using the UE Registration Procedure.\nThe EEC may cache the service provisioning information (e.g. EES endpoint) for subsequent use and avoid the need to repeat step 1. If the Lifetime IE is included in the Service provisioning response, then the EEC may cache and reuse the Service provisioning information only for the duration specified by the Lifetime IE, without the need to repeat step 1.\nIf the ECS provided information regarding the service continuity support of individual EESs, the EEC may take this information into account when selecting an EES for EEC registration, EAS discovery or T-EAS discovery, respectively.\nIf for multiple EES(s), the instantiable EAS information IE for an EAS is not available or the instantiable EAS information IE is set to instantiated or instantiable, the EEC can select one or more such EES to perform EAS discovery. For EAS discovery to mitigate the waste of EDN resources EEC considers the instantiable EAS information and the associated instantiation criteria, the EEC selects one EES, if the EAS instantiation status corresponding to the EASID requested by AC/EEC is instantiable but not yet instantiated (i.e. no instantiated EAS).\nNOTE 7:\tIf the service provisioning request fails, the EEC can resend the service provisioning request again, taking into account the received failure cause.\nAfter the EEC establishes a connection to an EES using information received in step 3, the EES can issue an AF request to influence traffic routing as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2] clause 5.6.7 in order to influence the user plane path to this connected EES.\nNOTE 8:\tFor example, using a particular DNAI to reach the data network containing the EES might be necessary to meet AC service KPIs.\nNOTE 9:\tIf the EAS instantiation fails based on the selected EES, the EEC may retry the EAS discovery request to another EES (e.g. selecting another one EES based on the instantiable EAS information).",

The request from the client includes the security credentials received after successful authorization for edge computing services and may include a proposed expiration time. The request also optionally includes information indicating to the EES how the EEC expects to use the services of the EES. The EEC may include indication for UE mobility support requirement to the EES.\nIf the EEC is moving to this EES from the purview of another EES, called S-EES, the request from the EEC may include the identity and endpoint of the S-EES and an EEC context ID that was provided by the S-EES to maintain continuity of the EEC context and to authorize EEC context relocation. If the EEC registration is being performed as part of ACR, the EEC shall not include the S-EES endpoint and the EEC context ID.\n2.\tUpon receiving the request from the EEC, the EES validates the registration request and verifies the security credentials. The EES further determines whether the requirements that were indicated in the AC Profile(s) can be fulfilled e.g., without failing to meet the requirements of the already registered EECs, and reserves corresponding resources (e.g., for EASs). If the AC Profile(s) include EAS bundle information the reserved EAS resources are apportioned among the EASs in the bundle, based on the indicated requirements and local policies.\nNOTE 1:\tResource reservation at EEC registration ensures that the EES provides services for the duration of the registration.\nIf the EEC provides in the registration request the EAS selection request indicator and based on EES local policies, the EES selects EASs providing the capabilities required by the AC Profile(s), reserves the corresponding resources, and provides the information to the EEC in the registration response.\nIf bundle EAS information (either as EAS bundle identifier or as a list of EASIDs) is included and the EAS selection request indicator is set, then the EES determines whether all or a subset of the EAS(s) in the bundle are registered and instantiated. If only a subset of bundle EASs is found, the EES may determine whether instantiable but not yet instantiated EASs match the subset of remaining (i.e. not yet found) bundle EASs and performs the dynamic EAS instantiation triggering procedure in clause 8.12 for this subset.\nIf the EEC provides in the registration request a UE type, the EES may use this information to apply UE-type-specific local policies.\nNOTE 2:\tWithout any indication from UE (either EAS selection request indication or UE type), the EES handling is as per R17 procedure.\nNOTE 3:\tThe \"UE type\" IE as present in EEC registration request message can be used by EES to identify \"constrained device\".\n3.\tUpon successful validation of the request, if the received EEC registration request contains an EEC context ID and a S-EES Endpoint, the EES performs an EEC Context Pull relocation (clause 8.9.2.2) from the S-EES. The source and target EES perform EEC Context handling as detailed in clause 8.9.1.\nNOTE 4:\tOnly a single EEC Context ID may be provided in the EEC registration request.\nNOTE 5:\tIn this version of specification, each registration procedure relocates a single EEC context.\nNOTE 6:\tStep 3 is executed when EEC determines to change its connection from S-EES to T-EES and ACR is not required.\nIf the EEC registration request fails after the EEC Context Pull relocation, e.g., the EES cannot reserve the necessary resources while meeting the capability requirements of the existing registered EECs, the EES shall determine the EEC Context information stale and send a failure response with a corresponding cause.\n4.\tThe EES sends a successful EEC registration response, which includes the registration ID and may include a newly assigned EEC context ID. If the EEC registration request contains AC Profile(s), and the EES determines that the requirements indicated in the AC profile(s) cannot be fulfilled for some of the AC profile(s), the EES shall include the list of ACIDs of such AC Profile(s) and may include appropriate reasons. If step 3 was executed, the EEC registration response also includes EEC context retrieval result. The EEC stores the new EEC context ID and uses it if and when it registers with another EES.

The EAS discovery request includes the requestor identifier [EECID] along with the security credentials and may include EAS discovery filters, EEC service continuity support, and may also include UE location to retrieve information about particular EAS(s) or a category of EASs, e.g. gaming applications, or Edge Applications Server(s) available in certain service areas, e.g. available on a UE's predicted or expected route. The request may include an EAS selection request indicator.\n2.\tUpon receiving the request from the EEC, the EES checks if the EEC is authorized to discover the requested EAS(s). The authorization check may apply to an individual EAS, a category of EASs or to the EDN, i.e. to all the EASs. If UE's location information is not already available, the EES obtains the UE location by utilizing the capabilities of the 3GPP core network as specified in clause 8.10.3. If EAS discovery filters are provided by the EEC, but it does not contain Application group profile, the EES identifies the EAS(s) based on the provided EAS discovery filters and the UE location.\nWhen the bundle EAS information is provided, then;\n-\tIf bundle EAS information includes EAS bundle identifier, the EES identifies all or part of the EAS(s) associated with the same EAS bundle identifier.\n-\tIf bundle EAS information includes a list of EASIDs, the EES identifies the EASs which are all or part of the EAS bundle.\nIf the EEC indicates that service continuity support is required, when identifying the EAS, the EES shall take the indication which ACR scenarios are supported by the AC, the EEC, the EES and the EAS and which of these are preferred by the AC into consideration. The EES may select one EAS and determine whether to perform application traffic influence for this AC based on AC's service KPI or EAS’s service KPI in desired response time, when the EAS does not perform traffic influence in advance.\nWhen EAS discovery filters are not provided, then:\n-\tif available, the EES identifies the EAS(s) based on the UE-specific service information at the EES and the UE location;\n-\tEES identifies the EAS(s) by applying the ECSP policy (e.g. based only on the UE location);\nWhen EAS discovery filters contain Application group profile, the EES checks whether information about common EAS and related Application Group ID is available or not. If the common EAS information related to the Application Group ID is:\n-\tnot available, then based on the policy if EES needs to select the common EAS, the EES identifies an EAS for the Application Group ID based on the provided EAS discovery filters such as KPIs, UE-specific service information or the ECSP policy. Furthermore, the EES stores the common EAS information and related Application Group ID.\n-\tavailable at the EES, then the EES provides information of that EAS as result for EAS discovery.\nNOTE 2:\tThe EES may have previously determined and stored the common EAS for Application group ID, or the EES may have received the common EAS selection information for Application group ID during the common EAS announcement procedure.\nWhen the ECS-ER is not available and the EES selects the common EAS, the selected common EAS shall be announced to other EES(s) as per procedure specified in clause 8.19.\nWhen the ECS-ER is available and common EAS information corresponding to the Application Group ID is not available, then the EES identifies one EAS for the group and interacts with the ECS-ER to store the common EAS information as described in clause 8.20.2.3. If common EAS information is already available corresponding to the Application Group ID in the repository, then the ECS-ER returns the common EAS information to the EES as described in clause 8.20.2.3.\nNOTE 3:\tDetails of the UE-specific service information and how it is available at the EES is out of scope.\nNOTE 4:\tBoth steps are evaluated prior to sending a response.\nUpon receiving the request from the EEC, the EES may also collect edge load analytics from ADAES (as specified in clause 8.8.2 of TS 23.436 [28]) or performance data from OAM to find whether the EAS(s) satisfies the Expected AC service KPIs or the Minimum required AC Service KPIs.\nUpon receiving the request from the EEC, if the EEC does not indicate EAS Instantiation Triggering Suppress in the EAS Discovery request, the EES may trigger the ECSP management system to instantiate the EAS that matches with EAS discovery filter IEs (e.g. ACID) as in clause 8.12.\nOtherwise, upon receiving the request from the EEC, if the EEC indicates EAS Instantiation Triggering Suppress in the EAS Discovery request and the EES supports such capability, the EES determines not triggering the ECSP management system to instantiate the EAS and may determine Instantiable EAS Information for EAS(s) that are instantiable but not yet instantiated and match the EAS discovery filter IEs. Instantiable EAS Information is provided in the EAS Discovery response and includes the EASID(s) and, for each EASID, the status indicating whether the EAS is instantiated or instantiable but not yet instantiated.\nIf the EEC provides in the EAS discovery request the EAS selection request indicator, the EES selects EAS satisfying the EAS discovery filter or based on other information (e.g. ECSP policy) as described above (if no EAS discovery filter received), and then provides the selected EAS information to the EEC in the discovered EAS list of EAS discovery response.\nNOTE 5:\tWithout EAS selection request indication, the EES handling is as per R17 procedure.\n3.\tIf the processing of the request was successful, the EES sends an EAS discovery response to the EEC, which includes information about the discovered EASs and Instantiable EAS Information. For discovered EASs, this includes endpoint information. Depending on the EAS discovery filters received in the EAS discovery request, the response may include additional information regarding matched capabilities, e.g. service permissions levels, KPIs, AC locations(s) that the EASs can support, ACR scenarios supported by the EAS, etc. The EAS discovery response may contain a list of EASs and Instantiable EAS Information. This list may be based on EAS discovery filters containing a Geographical or Topological Service Area, e.g. a route, included in the EAS discovery request by the EEC. When the discovered EAS is for a certain application group, then the Application Group ID is also included in the response message. If the discovered EAS is registered to another EES, then the EES endpoint of the EES where the discovered EAS is registered is also included in the response message.\nWhen the EES determines to trigger the EAS instantiation, then the response may indicate that the EAS instantiation is in progress so that the detailed EAS profile information will be available later. When EEC receives the EAS instantiation in progress indication, the EEC may send EAS discovery subscription request message or send EAS discovery request message later to the EES for obtaining updated EAS information.\nIf the EES is unable to determine the EAS information using the inputs in the EAS discovery request, UE-specific service information at the EES or the ECSP policy, the EES shall reject the EAS discovery request and respond with an appropriate failure cause.\nIf the EEC is not registered with the EES, and ECSP policy requires the EEC to perform EEC registration prior to EAS discovery, the EES shall include an appropriate failure cause in the EAS discovery response indicating that EEC registration is required.\nIf the UE location and predicted/expected UE locations, provided in the EAS discovery request, are outside the Geographical or Topological Service Area of an EAS, then the EES shall not include that EAS in the discovery response. The discovery response may include EAS(s) that cannot serve the UE at its current location if a predicted/expected UE location was provided in the EAS discovery request.\nUpon receiving the EAS discovery response, if the EEC selects an EAS which is instantiated (i.e., an EAS profile was provided), the EEC uses the endpoint information for routing of the outgoing application data traffic to EAS(s), as needed, and may provide necessary notifications to the AC(s). The EEC may use the border or overlap between EAS Geographical Service Areas for service continuity purposes. The EEC may cache the EAS information (e.g. EAS endpoint) for subsequent use and avoid the need to repeat step 1. If the Lifetime IE is included in the response, the EEC may cache the EAS information only for the duration specified by the Lifetime IE.\nUpon receiving the EAS discovery response, if the EEC selects an EAS which is instantiable but not yet instantiated (i.e. an EAS profile is not provided), the EEC sends the EAS information provisioning request indicating the selected EASID as in clause 8.15.\nNOTE 6:\tWithin the duration specified by the Lifetime IE, the cached EAS Profile can be updated (e.g. according to notifications from the EES for changes of EAS information due to EAS status change) or the cached EAS Profile can be invalidated due to new EAS information discovery (e.g. due to UE mobility). The EEC can update or invalidate the cached EAS information (e.g. on PDU Session Release or Modification Command).\nNOTE 7:\tThe AC can cache the EAS information (e.g. EAS endpoint) for subsequent use. In the case of the cached information needing to be updated or invalidated, the mechanisms for the EEC to notify the AC is up to implementation and is not specified in the current release of the present document.\nNOTE 8:\tThe EEC can use the EAS information provided by the discovery procedure to perform service continuity planning, for example when ultra-low latency ACR is required.\nIf the EAS discovery request fails, the EEC may resend the EAS discovery request, taking into account the received failure cause. If the failure cause indicated that EEC registration is required, the EEC shall perform an EEC registration before resending the EAS discovery request.\nNOTE 9:\tAs long as a proper EAS (e.g. considering expected AC service KPIs included in EAS discovery request) is discovered and selected by the EES, EEC of a constraint UE can stop sending EAS discovery to rest candidate EES(s), and provide the selected EAS information to AC.",

If UE's location information is not already available, the EES obtains the UE location by utilizing the capabilities of the 3GPP core network as specified in clause 8.10.3. If EAS discovery filters were provided by the EEC during subscription creation, the EES identifies the EAS(s) based on the provided EAS discovery filters and the UE location.\nFor EAS dynamic information change event, the EES, based on local policy, may use received EAS endpoints from EEC or all registered EAS endpoints to get edge load analytics information from ADAES services (e.g. as specified in clause 8.8 of TS 23.436 [27]) to monitor EAS service status like EAS status and EAS schedule.\nWhen the bundle EAS information is provided, then;\n-\tIf EAS bundle identifier was provided, the EES identifies all or part of the EAS(s) associated with the same EAS bundle identifier.\n-\tIf a list of EASIDs is provided, the EES identifies the EASs which are all or part of the EAS bundle.\nIf the EEC indicates that service continuity support is required, the EES shall take the indication which ACR scenarios are supported by the AC and the EEC and which of these are preferred by the AC into consideration.\nIf EAS discovery filters were not provided, then:\n-\tif available, the EES identifies the EAS(s) based on the UE-specific service information at the EES and the UE location;\n-\tEES identifies the EAS(s) by applying the ECSP policy (e.g. based only on the UE location);\nIf EAS discovery filters contain Application group profile, the EES checks whether information about common EAS and related Application Group ID is available or not. If the common EAS information related to the Application Group ID is available at the EES, then the EES provides information of that EAS as result for EAS discovery.\nNOTE 1:\tThe EES may have previously determined and stored the common EAS for Application group ID, or the EES may have received the common EAS selection information for Application group ID during the common EAS announcement procedure.\nNOTE 2:\tDetails of the UE-specific service information and how it is available at the EES is out of scope.\nNOTE 3:\tBoth steps are evaluated prior to sending a response.\nIf the UE is located outside the Geographical or Topological Service Area of an EAS, then the EES shall not include this EAS in the EAS discovery notification.\nIf the application triggering is supported and required by the EEC as indicated in EEC Triggering Request IE of the EAS Discovery Subscription Request, then the EES performs the EEC triggering service as described in the clause 8.16.1 and skips the step 2.\n2.\tThe EES sends an EAS discovery notification to the EEC with the EAS information determined in step 1, which includes information about the discovered EASs and Instantiable EAS Information. For discovered EASs, this includes endpoint information. Depending on the event type and EAS discovery filters received in the EAS discovery subscription request, the notification may include additional information regarding matched capabilities, e.g. service permissions levels, KPIs, AC locations(s) that the EASs can support, ACR scenarios supported by the EAS, etc. The EAS discovery notification may contain a list of EASs and Instantiable EAS Information. This list may be based on EAS discovery filters containing a Geographical or Topological Service Area, e.g. a route, included in the EAS discovery subscription request by the EEC. When the discovered EAS is for a certain application group, then the Application Group ID is also included in the notification message. If the discovered EAS is registered to another EES, then the EES endpoint of the EES where the discovered EAS is registered is also included in the notification message.\nUpon receiving the EAS discovery notification, if the EEC selects an EAS which is instantiated (i.e., an EAS profile was provided), the EEC uses the endpoint information for routing of the outgoing application data traffic to EAS(s), as needed, and may provide necessary notifications to the AC(s). The EEC may use the border or overlap between EAS Geographical Service Areas for service continuity purposes. The EEC may cache the EAS information (e.g. EAS endpoint) for subsequent use.

This API is used by an EAS or EEC to obtain the identifier of the UE if the EAS or EEC does not have it (e.g. hasn't already cached). This identifier, called UE ID and defined in clause 7.2.6, is used by the EAS to invoke capability APIs specific to UEs over EDGE-3 and/or EDGE-7 depending on the UE ID type.\nThe EAS's direct invocation of the UE Identifier API of the EES may result in UE ID not found response (e.g. if the NATed UE's public IPv4 address can't be resolved by the core network). Under such circumstances, the EAS may choose to signal its AC to trigger the UE ID query onto the EEC over EDGE-5 (see clause 8.14.2.6). In turn, the EEC would invoke the EES's UE Identifier API using the UE's CN assigned IP addresses (i.e. IPv4 and/or IPv6) which should result in return of the UE ID to the EEC and from thereon to the AC and the EAS.\nNOTE 1:\tTo overcome CN UE's assigned private IP address reuse issue (e.g. UE's private IPv4 reuse by 5GC), the EES would need to be pre-configured with the public IP address range (used by the NAT function over N6) and its associated IP domain.\nNOTE 2:\tEEC retrieval of the UE's IP address from the device is out of scope.",

      "content": "Figure 8.6.5.2-1 illustrates the interactions between the EES and the EAS or EEC.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe EAS or EEC is authorized to discover and to use UE Identifier API provided by the EES.\n2.\tWhen the EEC is used to invoke the UE Identifier API with the UE IPv6 address as the input parameter, the UE IPv6 address may or may not be NATed. If NATed however, the IPv6 may not be reused (i.e. assigned to more than one UE simultaneously). If the EEC already has the UE ID (GPSI as per clause 7.2.6), and it needs the Edge UE ID to share with an AC/EAS, this procedure can still be used to retrieve Edge UE ID.\nFigure 8.6.5.2-1: UE Identifier API\n1.\tThe EAS or EEC invokes UE Identifier API exposed by the EES. If it is the EAS invoking the API and it recognizes that the UE’s IP address is a public IP address, i.e., the UE is behind a NAT, the Port Number and associated IP address should be included in user information.\n2.\tThe EES uses the received user information in the step 1 (e.g. IP address) and obtains the UE identifier by interacting with NEF as specified in clause 4.15.10 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3]. If it is the EEC invoking the API with only UE IP address, it shall be interpreted by EES that EEC is requesting the UE ID for interaction with EES (hence EES shall use its own AF Identifier towards NEF and consequently the UE ID is EES specific). When the EES needs to interact with the NEF's Nnef_UEId_Get (see TS 23.502 clause 4.15.10 \"AF specific UE ID retrieval\") as per EAS request, the EES may use either its own AF Identifier or EASID as AF Identifier instead of its own AF Identifier.\n3.\tThe EES provides the UE identifier to the EAS or to EEC (i.e. whichever invoked the API). The UE identifier returned in the response which is referred to as UE ID may be the 3GPP Core Network assigned UE ID (aka AF-specific UE ID; see TS 23.502 clause 4.15.10) or the EES-generated Edge UE ID as defined in clause 7.2.9. If UE ID (GPSI as per clause 7.2.6) is included in the request received from EEC, the EES can provide the Edge UE ID based on the received UE ID and step 2 can be skipped. For EEC requesting the UE ID for interaction with EES, the EES returns its 3GPP Core Network assigned UE ID (aka AF specific UE ID, which is a GPSI in the form of an External ID as per clause 7.2.6) to the EEC.\nNOTE 1:\tUser consent aspect on sharing the AF specific UE identifier with particular EAS is described in 3GPP TS 33.558 [23].\n4.\tThe EAS uses the UE ID received in step 3 to invoke capability exposure API(s) provided by the EES over EDGE-3 and/or EDGE-7 depending on the UE ID type. The EEC can use the UE ID which is EES specific received in step 3 to invoke API(s) provided by the EES over EDGE-1 reference point.\nNOTE 2:\tUE ID of type CN-assigned can be used over EDGE-1, EDGE-3 and EDGE-7 whereas the UE ID of type EES-generated Edge UE ID can be used over EDGE-3 only.",

It is used to request reservation of resources for a data session between AC and EAS with a specific QoS and to subscribe to certain session with QoS event notifications.\nFigure 8.6.6.2.2-1: Session with QoS API: create operation\n1.\tThe EAS requests establishment of a data session between the AC and the EAS with a specific QoS (either QoS reference or bandwidth). If the data session can adjust to different QoS parameter combinations, the request may include a list of alternative QoS references in a priority order. The EAS shall include the UE's IP address, UE ID or UE Group ID, the DNN and S-NSSAI used for the data session between AC and EAS. With the same request the EAS subscribes to receive certain session with QoS event notifications (e.g. notifications related to QoS monitoring, usage monitoring for sponsored data connectivity and/or QoS targets can no longer (or can again) be fulfilled).\n2.\tThe EES checks if the EAS is authorized for this operation for the UE. If authorized, then the following services of 3GPP CN may be used by the EES:\na.\tthe EES invokes the PFD management procedure with the 3GPP Core Network as described in 3GPP TS 23.682 [10] and 3GPP TS 23.502 [8] with an application id. At least one of the IP flow description, domain description or URI sent by the EAS is used for requesting PFD management service. Further the EES provides the same application id for requesting data session with specific QoS in step 2c or step 4.\nNOTE 1:\tPFD management can be optionally supported in MNO. If EES cannot invoke step 2a, it responds EAS with appropriate error.\nNOTE 2:\tThe EES can map the EASID into the application id that is used to invoke the PFD management procedure.\nb.\tthe EES invokes the Event Monitoring service for PDU session status with the 3GPP Core Network, as described in 3GPP TS 23.502 [3].\nc.\tthe EES invokes the Policy Authorization Create service or the AF Session with QoS service with the 3GPP Core Network (PCF or NEF, respectively) as described in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2] and 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], providing the specific QoS (QoS reference or bandwidth) to the PCF as described in 3GPP TS 23.503 [12], clause 6.1.3.22. Additionally, the EES may subscribe to notifications of resource allocation outcome and to other events described in clause 6.1.3.18 of 3GPP TS 23.503 [12], e.g. notifications of when the QoS targets can no longer (or can again) be fulfilled.\nThe usage of step 2b and step 2c is as follows:\n-\tIf the request is for a group of UEs identified by the UE Group ID or for a single UE identified by the UE ID, then EES executes step 2b. If UE (single UE or UE group member) already has ongoing PDU session, then UE IP address is retrieved in step 2b. Further the EES executes step 2c; otherwise the EES waits for further notification for PDU session status in step 4.\n-\tIf the request is for a single UE identified by the IP address, then EES executes step 2c.\n3.\tIf the operation in step 2 is successful, the EES responds with a Context ID and a Result. The Context ID is to be used by the EAS for further requests (e.g. session with QoS update requests) pertaining to the same UE. If the EAS is not authorized or any other failure happens during the operation, the EES provides a rejection response with cause information.\n4.\tWhen the EES receives the corresponding UE IP address for the single UE or UE group member from the PDU session status notification sent by the 3GPP Core Network, the EES requests data session with specific QoS as described in step 2c.\nNOTE 3:\tThe EES will report the resource allocation outcome, e.g. the successful allocation of the Service Data Flow(s) related to the data session, with a separate session with QoS notify operation (see TS 23.503 [12], clause 6.1.3.18).",

      "content": "When a UE moves to a new location, different EASs can be more suitable for serving the ACs in the UE. Such transitions can result from a non-mobility event also, requiring support from the enabling layer to maintain the continuity of the service.\nThis clause describes the features that support service continuity for ACs in the UE to minimize service interruption while replacing the S-EAS, with a T-EAS.\nGenerally, one AC on the UE has one associated application context at the S-EAS. To support service continuity, this application context is transferred from the S-EAS to a T-EAS.\nThe capabilities for supporting service continuity provided at the Edge Enabler Layer may consider various application layer scenarios in which there may be involvement of AC and one or more EAS(s).\nFollowing intra-EDN, inter-EDN, between EDN and Cloud, and LADN (overlapping LADN service areas) related scenarios are supported for service continuity:\n-\tUE mobility, including predictive or expected UE mobility;\n-\tOverload situations in S-EAS or EDN; and\n-\tMaintenance aspects such as graceful shutdown of an EAS.\nNOTE 1:\tThe scenarios which require ACR for service continuity, cannot use non-overlapping LADNs.\nNOTE 2:\tOverload situations in S-EAS or EDN can be captured based on edge load analytics via utilizing SEAL ADAE capability (see clauses 6.7 and 8.8 of TS 23.436 [28]), which provide statistics or predictions on the expected load of S-EAS or EDN.\nNOTE 3:\tThe ACR between EDN and the Cloud may be triggered if no suitable target EAS is found.\nTo support the need of ACR, following entity roles are identified:\n-\tdetection entity, detecting or predicting the need of ACR;\n-\tdecision-making entity, deciding that the ACR is required; and\n-\texecution entity, executing ACR.\nA detection entity detects the probable need for ACR by monitoring various aspects, such as UE's location or predicted/expected UE location and indicates to the decision-making entity to determine if the ACR is required. The EEC, EES and EAS can potentially perform the detection role:\nA decision-making entity determines that ACR is required and instructs the execution entity to perform ACR. The decision-making entity makes a ACR decision to start the ACR execution. In different scenarios of ACR in 8.8.2, the EEC, EAS, EES can potentially perform the decision role respectively.\nAn execution entity performs ACR as and when instructed by the decision-making entity. ACR execution starts with T-EAS discovery, which can be triggered by EEC, EAS and EES.\nNOTE 3:\tAfter a decision that another EAS is to serve the UE, the S-EAS can decide if the existing Application Context is transferred to the new EAS.\nThe EAS may utilize the following capabilities provided by the EES for supporting service continuity at the application layer:\n-\tSubscribe to service continuity related events and receive corresponding notifications;\n-\tDiscover the T-EAS; and\n-\tACR from a S-EAS to a T-EAS.\nThe EES can utilize the following capabilities provided by the ECS for supporting service continuity at the application layer:\n-\tRetrieve the T-EES.\nThe EEC may determine if the ACR is required by detecting that the UE moved or is predicted or expected to move outside the service area (see clause 7.3.3). The service area can be provided to the EEC by either the ECS during Service Provisioning or EES during EAS Discovery. For the PDU Session of SSC mode 3, if the UE receives PDU Session Modification Command as specified in clause 4.3.5.2 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], the EEC may determine that the ACR is required. For IPv6 multi-homed PDU Session of SSC mode 3, the EEC may determine that ACR is required if the UE is notified of the existence and availability of a new IPv6 prefix as specified in clause 4.3.5.3 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3].\nNOTE 4:\tFor IPv6 multi-homed PDU Session of SSC mode 3, the EEC can be aware of the notification about the IPv6 prefix configuration due to change of PSA UPF based on the UE implementation.\nAfter successful ACR:\n-\tThe EES is informed of the completion by the EAS; and\n-\tThe EEC is informed of the completion by the EES.\nIn general, a number of steps are required in order to perform ACR. The potential roles of an edge enablement layer in ACR include:\n-\tproviding detection events;\n-\tselecting the T-EAS(s); and\n-\tsupporting the transfer of the application context from the S-EAS(s) to the T-EAS(s).\nIf the UE is connected to the 5GC, the EES/EAS acting as AF may utilize AF traffic influence functionality from the 3GPP CN as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 [3].\nA high level overview of ACR is illustrated in Figure 8.8.1.1-1.\nFigure 8.8.1.1-1: High level overview of ACR\nACR can be performed for service continuity planning, which means that the first three steps in Figure 8.8.1.1-1 detection, decision and execution, are performed as defined in clause 8.8.1.2, e.g. when the UE is predicted to move outside the service area of the serving EAS. In such a case the T-EAS is to service the UE when it moves to the expected location.\nEES can handle multiple ACR requests simultaneously.

For example, the EEC or EES can monitor the UE’s mobility and obtain updates in the predicted location or other ACR parameters e.g. prediction expiration time.\nFor ACRs initiated by the S-EES, the S-EES may detect a change of the expected UE behaviour. In particular, S-EES acting as AF, may receive a UE location report or a monitoring event report from 5GC (assuming that S-EES has subscribed to consume 5GC services like LCS or NEF monitoring events related to UE actual location, or UE mobility analytics from NWDAF).

      "content": "This clause describes solution of relocating EASs in a bundle together instead of individual relocation for AC-EAS sessions one by one. To avoid ACR being triggered for each EAS in a bundle with different initiators (e.g. EAS 1 and EAS 2 in a bundle trigger ACR simultaneously), a main EAS may be used and a main EES is used correspondingly. The main EAS or EES is responsible for ACR detection and initiation in the network side. The main EAS information is sent to EEL and the main EES is the EES registering the main EAS.\nNOTE 1:\tASP can have requirement of the dependencies between bundled EAS(s) when provisioning them for any deployment scenario, and indicate whether the affinity between them as strong (co-deployment is essential) or weak (co-deployment is only \"nice to have\").\nNOTE 2:\tIt is possible that some EASs in a bundle do not need relocation because the UE can still be served by these EASs. A deployment example is both EASs providing services covering the whole city and EASs providing services covering city district are serving the AC as an EAS bundle, and when UE moves from one district to another district in the city, only EASs serving the district from where UE is moving out need relocation.\nNOTE 3:\tIn the proxy type of bundle, the main EAS is the connecting EAS serving the AC.\nNOTE 4:\tIn current release of the specification, the main EAS is selected by ASP.",

      "content": "In this scenario, ACR is a result of the UE moving to, or the UE expecting to move to, a new location which is outside the service area of the serving EAS. The EEC is triggered as a result of the UE's movement as described in 8.8.1.1 or by an AC as described in clause 8.14.2.4.\nThis scenario is based on Service Provisioning (as specified in clause 8.3) and EAS Discovery (as specified in clause 8.5) procedures to discover the T-EES and EAS that shall serve the AC as a result of the UE's new location, and that shall receive the Application Context from the serving EAS.\nThis scenario relies on the EDGE-5 interface between the EEC and AC.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe AC in the UE already has a connection to a corresponding S-EAS;\n2.\tThe preconditions listed in clause 8.3.3.2.2 with regards to the EEC are fulfilled; and\n3.\tThe EEC is triggered when it obtains the UE's new location or is triggered by another entity such as an ECS notification or AC trigger.\nNOTE 1:\tThis scenario is applicable only for an Edge-aware AC and EAS.\nFigure 8.8.2.2-1: ACR initiated by the EEC and AC\nPhase I: ACR Detection\n1.\tThe EEC detects the UE location update as a result of a UE mobility event and is provided with the UE's new location as described in clause 8.8.1.1. The EEC can also detect an expected or predicted UE location in the future as described in clause 8.8.1.1.\nNOTE 2:\tIf the EEC is triggered by an external entity such as by a notification from the ECS, a list of new EESs (to be used as T-EESs) is provided by that notification and step 3 below is skipped.\nPhase II: ACR Decision\n2.\tEither the AC or the EEC makes the decision to perform the ACR. If the EEC has received information of on-going ACR, then it should not initiate an ACR with the same ACR identity uniquely identified by ACID, EEC ID (or UE ID), S-EAS endpoint and T-EAS endpoint again per clause 8.8.3.5.3.\nNOTE 3:\tWhich applications require ACR can be decided based on the application profile, e.g. requirement of service continuity of the application.\nIf the change in UE's location does not trigger a need to change the serving EAS, steps 3 onwards are skipped. The EEC remains connected to the serving EES(s) and the AC remains connected to its corresponding serving EAS.\nPhase III:\tACR Execution\n3.\tThe EEC performs Service Provisioning (as specified in clause 8.3) for all active applications that require ACR. Since the location of the UE has changed, the Service Provisioning procedure results in a list of T-EESs that are relevant to the supplied applications and the new location of the UE. When in step 1 the ACR for service continuity planning is triggered, then the Connectivity information and UE Location in the Service Provisioning procedure (as specified in clause 8.3) contains the expected Connectivity information and expected UE Location.\nIf Service Provisioning results in no T-EES, and if ACR to CAS is supported, then the procedure for ACR with CAS applies as specified in clause 8.8.2A.2.\n4.\tThe EEC performs EAS discovery (as specified in clause 8.5) for the desired T-EASs by querying the T-EESs that were established in step 3 (or provided in the notification from the ECS – if it was the trigger). If EEC registration configuration for the EESs established in step 2 indicates that EEC registration is required, the EEC performs EEC registration with the EESs (as specified in clause 8.4.2.2.2) before sending the EAS discovery request. Step 5 is skipped if EAS discovery procedure results in only one discovered T-EAS.\nWhen in step 1 the ACR for service continuity planning is triggered, and the \"General context holding time duration\" is included in the replied EAS discovery response, the EEC can make ACR request before it reaches respective T-EAS service area within the time period indicated by the IE.\n5.\tThe AC and EEC select the T-EAS to be used for the application traffic.\nNOTE 4:\tSeveral EEC registrations with different EESs may result from T-EAS discovery process during a single ACR operation.\n6.\tThe EEC performs ACR launching procedure (as described in clause 8.8.3.4) to the S-EES with predicted/expected UE location or Expected AC Geographical Service Area, the ACR action indicating ACR initiation and the corresponding ACR initiation data (without the need to notify the EAS). When the S-EES receives the predicted/expected UE location or Expected AC Geographical Service Area from the EEC, then the S-EES will determine to monitor the UE mobility. The S-EES may apply the AF traffic influence with the N6 routing information of the T-EAS in the 3GPP Core Network (if applicable), as described in clause 8.8.3.4. If the EEC has not subscribed to receive ACR information notifications for ACR complete events from the S-EES, the EEC subscribes for the notifications as described in clause 8.8.3.5.2.\nNOTE 5:\tIt is expected that the AC will inform EAS about UE location monitoring is not needed\n7.\tIf the T-EES is different than the S-EES and the EEC Context at the S-EES is not stale, the S-EES initiates EEC Context Push relocation with the T-EES as described in clause 8.9.2.3. Otherwise, if the T-EES is the same as the S-EES, EEC Context Push relocation is skipped.\n8.\tThe AC is triggered by the EEC to start ACT. The AC decides to initiate the transfer of application context from the S-EAS to the T-EAS. There may be different ways of transferring context and they are all outside the scope of this specification.\nWhen in step 1 the ACR for service continuity planning has been triggered, the AC connects to the T-EAS when the UE moves to the predicted location. Otherwise, the rest of this step is skipped.\nAfter the ACT is completed, the AC remains connected to the T-EAS and disconnects from the S-EAS; the EEC is informed of the completion.\nNOTE 6:\tWhether and how the AC initiates the ACT is out of scope of the present document\nWhen in step 1 the ACR has been triggered for service continuity planning, if the UE does not move to the expected/predicted location the EEC does not connect to T-EES, the AC does not connect to the T-EAS.\nNOTE 7:\tThe S-EAS or T-EAS can further decide to terminate the ACR, and the T-EAS can discard the application context based on information received from EEL and/or other methods (e.g. monitoring the location of the UE). It is up to the implementation of the S-EAS and T-EAS whether and how to make such a decision.\nNOTE 8:\tIt is out of scope of this specification how the AC informs the S-EAS and T-EAS that ACT was part of service continuity planning. When in step 1 the ACR for service continuity planning is triggered, the S-EAS and the T-EAS can wait for the UE to move to the predicted location before they perform the Post ACR Clean up steps 9 and 10 if it is the EAS monitoring whether the UE moves to the predicted/expected location. When the S-EAS and the T-EAS do not wait for the UE (e.g., if the UE does not move to the predicted location), the S-EAS and the T-EAS can perform the Post ACR Clean up with failure messages.\nNOTE 9:\tIf the S-EAS and T-EAS are main EASs forming proxy bundle, other EASs of the bundle may transfer the application contexts in this step. How to execute ACT is out of scope of this document.\nPhase IV:\tPost-ACR Clean up\n9.\tThe S-EAS sends the ACR status update message to the S-EES as specified in clause 8.8.3.8.\n10.\tThe T-EAS sends the ACR status update message to the T-EES as specified in clause 8.8.3.8. If the status indicates a successful ACT, and that the EEC Context relocation procedure was attempted but failed, then the T-EES indicates the failure to the T-EAS with the ACR status update response.\nNOTE 10:\tIf the EDGE-3 subscription initialization result indicates failure, then the EAS can perform the required EDGE-3 subscriptions at the T-EES.\nNOTE 11:\tSteps 9 and 10 can occur in any order.\n11.\tIf the status in step 9 indicates a successful ACT, for non-planning case the S-EES sends the ACR information notification (ACR complete) message immediately to the EEC to confirm that the ACR has completed as specified in clause 8.8.3.5.3. For the service continuity planning case, if it is EES monitors the UE mobility, then only when S-EES detects the UE has moved to the predicted/expected UE location or Expected AC Geographical Service Area and the status in step 9 indicates a successful ACT, then the S-EES sends ACR information notification (ACR complete) message to the EEC indicating that UE has moved to the predicted location when the ACR type is service continuity planning. If the EEC Context relocation procedure was attempted, then the notification includes EEC context relocation status IE, indicating the result of the EEC context relocation procedure. If the EEC context relocation status indicates that the EEC context relocation was not successful, then the EEC may perform the required EDGE-1 operations such as create subscriptions at the T-EES.",

      "content": "Figure 8.8.2.5-1 illustrates the S-EES detecting, deciding and executing ACR from the S-EAS to the T-EAS. This may include EELManagedACR by S-EES when initiated by S-EAS as per clause 8.8.3.6. The EEC or the S-EAS may also detect the ACR as illustrated in figure 8.8.2.5-1.\nNOTE 1:\tFor this clause, S-EAS either supports ACR detection capability or performs subscription for ACR management event to EES.\nPre-condition:\n1.\tThe AC at the UE already has a connection to the S-EAS;\n2.\tThe EEC is able to communicate with the S-EES;\n3.\tThe EEC has subscribed to receive ACR information notifications for target information notification events and ACR complete events from the S-EES, as described in clause 8.8.3.5.2;\n4.\tThe S-EAS optionally subscribed to receive ACR management notifications for \"ACR facilitation\" events to the S-EES, in order to enable detection at S-EAS.\n5.\tIn case of EELManagedACR, the T-EAS has subscribed to receive ACT status notifications as described in clause 8.8.3.6.2.3.\nFigure 8.8.2.5-1: S-EES executed ACR\n1.\tThe S-EAS may initiate EELManagedACR with S-EES as specified in clause 8.8.3.6. The S-EAS and S-EES negotiate an address of the Application Context storage to S-EES. The S-EAS puts the Application Context at this address which can be further accessed by the S-EES when the ACT is required.\nIn the EELManagedACR case, the S-EES executes steps 2 (i.e., S-EES is the detection entity), 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13 and 14. Rest of steps are skipped.\nPhase I: ACR Detection\n2.\tDetection entities (S-EAS, S-EES, EEC) detect that ACR may be required and identify the ACID and Predicted/Expected UE location or Expected AC Geographical Service Area as described in clause 8.8.1.1. The detection by the S-EES may be triggered by the User Plane path change notification received from the 3GPP Core Network due to S-EAS request for \"ACR facilitation\" event (see clause 8.6.3) or due to step 1.\nThe detection entity may detect that ACR may be required for an expected or predicted UE location in the future as described in clause 8.8.1.1.\nPhase II: ACR Decision\n3.\tThe detection entity performs ACR launching procedure (as described in clause 8.8.3.4) with the ACR action indicating ACR determination and the corresponding ACR determination data. If the EEC or S-EAS detect the ACR event, the EEC or S-EAS may inform S-EES with ACID, and predicted/expected UE location or Expected AC Geographical Service Area in the ACR launching procedure.\n4.\tThe S-EES authorises the message if received. The S-EES decides to execute ACR based on the information received or local detection, and the information of EEC context or EAS profile, and then proceed the below steps. When the S-EES receives the predicted/expected UE location or Expected AC Geographical Service Area from the EEC or the EAS in ACR determination, or the S-EES received service continuity planning from EAS in ACR facilitation event subscription, then the S-EES will determine to monitor the UE mobility. If S-EES has received information of on-going ACR, then it should not initiate an ACR with the same ACR identity uniquely identified by ACID, EEC ID (or UE ID), S-EAS endpoint and T-EAS endpoint again per clause 8.6.3.2.3.\nPhase III:\tACR Execution\n5a.\tThe S-EES determines T-EES and T-EAS via the Discover T-EAS procedure in clause 8.8.3.2 of the present document. When in step 2 the ACR has been triggered for service continuity planning, then UE Location and Target DNAI values provided in the Retrieve T-EES procedure contain the expected UE Location and expected Target DNAI. The S-EES may decide not to perform ACR if T-EAS is not available.\nIf T-EAS discovery results in no T-EAS, and if ACR to CAS is supported, then the procedure for ACR with CAS applies as specified in clause 8.8.2A.5.\n5b.\tIf required, the S-EES performs ACR parameter information procedure by sending the ACR parameter information request to the T-EES as described in clause 8.8.3.9. For example, when the ACR is for service continuity planning, and the S-EES has received it in ACR launch in step 2, the S-EES sends ACR parameter information request which includes Prediction expiration time.\n6.\tIf the T-EES is different than the S-EES and the EEC Context at the S-EES is not stale, the S-EES initiates EEC Context Push relocation with the T-EES as described in clause 8.9.2.3. Otherwise, if the T-EES is the same as the S-EES, EEC Context Push relocation is skipped.\n7.\tThe S-EES sends the target information notification to the EEC as described in clause 8.8.3.5.3.\nNOTE 2:\tStep 7 can be performed after step 5. The S-EES can send target information notification to the EEC immediately after having the target information in order to avoid EEC to initiate another ACR with the same identity\n8.\tThe S-EES may apply the AF traffic influence with the N6 routing information of the T-EAS in the 3GPP Core Network (if applicable).\n9.\tThe S-EES sends the ACR management notification (e.g. as notification for \"ACR facilitation\" event or \"ACT start\" event as described in clause 8.6.3 or due to step 1) to the S-EAS to initiate ACT between the S-EAS and the T-EAS.\n10.\tThe Application Context is transferred from S-EAS to the T-EAS at implementation specific time. In the case of EELManagedACR, the S-EES accesses the Application Context from the address as per step 1 and the S-EES and T-EES engage in the ACT from S-EAS to the T-EAS (obtained as per step 5) in a secure way. Further the T-EAS accesses the Application Context made available by the T-EES. If S-EAS performs the ACT directly with T-EAS, the specification of such process is out of scope of the present document.\nNOTE 3:\tThe Application Context is encrypted and protected by the application layer. The S-EES and the T-EES engage in the packet level transport of the Application Context and they have no visibility to the content of the Application Context.\nWhen in step 2 the ACR has been triggered for service continuity planning, if the UE does not move to the predicted location, the EEC does not connect to T-EES, the AC does not connect to the T-EAS.\nNOTE 3:\tThe S-EAS or T-EAS can further decide to terminate the ACR, and the T-EAS can discard the application context based on information received from EEL and/or other methods (e.g. monitoring the location of the UE). It is up to the implementation of the S-EAS and T-EAS whether and how to make such a decision.\nNOTE 4:\tWhen in step 2 the ACR has been triggered for service continuity planning, the S-EAS and the T-EAS can wait for the UE to move to the predicted location before they perform the Post ACR Clean up steps 12 and 13 if it is the EAS monitoring whether the UE moves to the predicted or expected location. When the S-EAS and the T-EAS do not wait for the UE (e.g., if the UE does not move to the predicted location), the S-EAS and the T-EAS can perform Post ACR Clean up with failure messages.\nNOTE 5:\tIf the S-EAS and T-EAS are main EASs forming proxy bundle, other EASs of the bundle may transfer the application contexts in this step. How to execute ACT is out of scope of this document.\nPhase IV:\tPost-ACR Clean up\n11.\tIn case of EELManagedACR, once the ACT is successful, the T-EES sends an ACT status notification to the T-EAS as described in clause 8.8.3.6.2.4, indicating that the Application Context is available.\n12.\tThe S-EAS sends the ACR status update message to the S-EES as specified in clause 8.8.3.8.\n13.\tThe T-EAS sends the ACR status update message to the T-EES as specified in clause 8.8.3.8. If the status indicates a successful ACT, and that the EEC Context relocation procedure was attempted but failed, then the T-EES indicates the failure to the T-EAS with the ACR status update response.\nNOTE 6:\tIf the EDGE-3 subscription initialization result indicates failure, then the EAS can perform the required EDGE-3 subscriptions at the T-EES.\nNOTE 7:\tSteps 12 and 13 can occur in any order.\n14.\tIf the status in step 12 indicates a successful ACT or in the EELManagedACR case, the S-EES sends the ACR information notification (ACR complete) message immediately to the EEC to confirm that the ACR has completed as specified in clause 8.8.3.5.3. For the service continuity planning case, if it is EES monitors the UE mobility, then only when S-EES detects the UE has moved to the predicted/expected UE location or Expected AC Geographical Service Area and the status in step 12 indicates a successful ACT, then the S-EES sends ACR information notification (ACR complete) message to the EEC when the ACR type is service continuity planning. If the EEC Context relocation procedure was attempted, then the notification includes EEC context relocation status IE, indicating the result of the EEC context relocation procedure. If the EEC context relocation status indicates that the EEC context relocation was not successful, then the EEC may perform the required EDGE-1 operations such as create subscriptions at the T-EES.\nNOTE 8:\tThe Application Client mechanism to support switchover of the application traffic to T-EAS is out of scope of the specification.",

      "content": "In this scenario, the EEC is triggered as a result of the UE's movement as described in 8.8.1.1 or by an AC as described in clause 8.14.2.4. Figure 8.8.2.6-1 illustrates the EEC executing ACR via the T-EES.\nPre-condition:\n1.\tThe EEC has the S-EAS information that serves the AC.\nFigure 8.8.2.6-1: EEC executed ACR via T-EES\nPhase I: ACR Detection\n1.\tThe EEC detects that ACR may be required as described in clause 8.8.1.1. The EEC may detect that ACR may be required for an expected or predicted UE location in the future as described in clause 8.8.1.1.\nPhase II: ACR Decision\n2.\tThe EEC decides to proceed with required procedures for ACR. If the EEC has received information of on-going ACR, then it should not initiate an ACR with the same ACR identity uniquely identified by ACID, EEC ID (or UE ID), S-EAS endpoint and T-EAS endpoint again per clause 8.8.3.5.3.\nNOTE 1:\tIf supported, the AC can be involved in the decision. It is out of scope of the present document how the AC is involved.\nPhase III:\tACR Execution\n3.\tThe EEC determines the T-EES by using the provisioned information or performing service provisioning procedure per clause 8.3. When in step 1 the ACR for service continuity planning is triggered, then the Connectivity information and UE Location used in the service provisioning procedure contain the expected Connectivity information and expected UE Location. If the UE is within the service area of the T-EES, upon selecting the T-EES the UE may need to establish a new PDU connection to the target EDN. If EEC registration configuration for the T-EES indicates that EEC registration is required, the EEC performs registration with the selected T-EES as specified in clause 8.4.2.2.2. The EEC performs EAS Discovery with the T-EES per clause 8.5.2.\nWhen in step 1 the ACR for service continuity planning is triggered, and the \"General context holding time duration\" is included in the replied EAS discovery response, the EEC can make ACR request before it reaches respective T-EAS service area within the time period indicated by the IE.\nNOTE 2:\tSeveral EEC registrations with different EESs may result from T-EAS discovery process during a single ACR operation.\n4.\tThe EEC performs ACR launching procedure (as described in clause 8.8.3.4) to the T-EES with predicted/expected UE location or Expected AC Geographical Service Area, the ACR action indicating ACR initiation and the corresponding ACR initiation data (with the need to notify the EAS). When the T-EES receives the predicted/expected UE location or Expected AC Geographical Service Area from the EEC, then the T-EES will determine to monitor the UE mobility. If the received ACR initiation request contains an EEC context ID and the S-EES Endpoint, the T-EES performs an EEC Context Pull relocation (clause 8.9.2.2). The T-EES may apply the AF traffic influence with the N6 routing information of the T-EAS in the 3GPP Core Network (if applicable). Then the T-EES sends the ACR management notification with \"ACT start\" event message to the T-EAS, the T-EES includes indication of service continuity planning if the T-EES determines to monitor UE mobility during post-ACR phase. If the ACR request in ACR launching procedure includes ACR parameters, e.g. Prediction expiration time, the T-EES includes the ACR parameters in the notification to T-EAS. The EEC also subscribes to receive ACR information notifications for ACR complete events from the T-EES, as described in clause 8.8.3.5.2.\n5.\tThe T-EAS initiates ACT between the S-EAS and the T-EAS. This process is out of scope of the present specification.\nWhen in step 1 the ACR has been triggered for service continuity planning, if the UE does not move to the predicted location the EEC does not connect to T-EES, the AC does not connect to the T-EAS.\nNOTE 3:\tThe S-EAS or T-EAS can further decide to terminate the ACR, and the T-EAS can discard the application context based on information received from EEL and/or other methods (e.g. monitoring the location of the UE). It is up to the implementation of the S-EAS and T-EAS whether and how to make such a decision.\nNOTE 4:\tWhen in step 1 the ACR has been triggered for service continuity planning, the S-EAS and the T-EAS can wait for the UE to move to the predicted location before the T-EAS performs the Post ACR Clean up step 6 if it is the EAS monitoring whether the UE moves to the predicted/expected location. When the S-EAS and the T-EAS do not wait for the UE (e.g., if the UE does not move to the predicted location), the T-EAS can perform Post ACR Clean up with failure messages.\nNOTE 5:\tIf the S-EAS and T-EAS are main EASs forming proxy bundle, other EASs of the bundle may transfer the application contexts in this step. How to execute ACT is out of scope of this document.\nPhase IV:\tPost-ACR clean up\n6.\tThe T-EAS sends the ACR status update message to the T-EES as specified in clause 8.8.3.8. If the status indicates a successful ACT, and that the EEC Context relocation procedure was attempted but failed, then the T-EES indicates the failure to the T-EAS with the ACR status update response.\nNOTE 6:\tIf the EDGE-3 subscription initialization result indicates failure, then the EAS can perform the required EDGE-3 subscriptions at the T-EES.\n7.\tThe T-EES immediately sends the ACR information notification (ACR complete) message to the EEC as described in clause 8.8.3.5.3 for non-planning case. For the service continuity planning case, if it is EES monitors the UE mobility, then only when T-EES detects the UE has moved to the predicted/expected UE location or Expected AC Geographical Service Area and the status in step 6 indicates a successful ACT, then the S-EES sends ACR information notification (ACR complete) message to the EEC indicating that UE has moved to the predicted location when the ACR type is service continuity planning.

If the EEC context relocation status indicates that the EEC context relocation was not successful, then the EEC may perform the required EDGE-1 operations such as create subscriptions at the T-EES.\nIf the procedure fails after step 4, it will be terminated with an appropriate cause in the ACR information notification to the EEC in step 7. The EEC may then proceed attempting to obtain services from the T-EAS discovered in step 3 without service continuity support. Alternatively, the EEC may resume the present procedure starting with step 4 and selecting a different T-EES discovered in step 3 with EAS service continuity support.\nNOTE 7:\tThe support of ACR between EDNs operated by different ECSPs is dependent on business agreement between the ECSPs.",

The ACR can be triggered by a change or expected change in UE location or in case of an overload situation or maintenance aspects in the S-EAS or EDN if no suitable target EAS is found as described in clause 8.8.1.1 depending on the scenario.\nTo facilitate future ACRs from the CAS back to EAS, the EEC may request and receive an AF-specific UE ID or Edge UE ID from the S-EES as described in clause 8.6.5, which can be used by the CAS to perform EAS discovery on the S-EES when there is an ACR from CAS back to an EAS. The EEC may also request to subscribe to notifications from the S-EES via the SEAL notification management service as described in clause 9.1 to receive ACR notifications if the EEC is no longer within reach from the S-EES.\n8.8.2A.2\tEnabling ACR with CAS - Initiation by EEC using regular EAS Discovery\nIn this scenario, ACR is a result of the UE moving to, or the UE expecting to move to, a new location which is outside the service area of the serving EAS. It further relies on the EEC being triggered as a result of the UE's movement.\nThis scenario is based on Service Provisioning (as specified in clause 8.3) and DNS procedures to discover the CAS that shall serve the AC as a result of the UE's new location, and that shall receive the Application Context from the serving EASs. The scenario below describes the relocation of a single application context to a CAS. However, it should be repeated for each active AC in the UE for which EAS or EDN is not available on that UE location.\nThis scenario description is same as described for figure 8.8.2.2-1 except for the following clarifications:\nPre-conditions: Same pre-conditions apply described for figure 8.8.2.2-1.\nFigure 8.8.2A.2-1: Enabling ACR with CAS - Initiation by EEC using regular EAS Discovery\nPhase I: ACR Detection\n1.\tSame as step 1 described for figure 8.8.2.2-1.\nPhase II: ACR Decision\n2.\t Same as step 2 described for figure 8.8.2.2-1.\nPhase III:\tACR Execution\n3.\tThe EEC performs Service Provisioning (as specified in clause 8.3) for all active applications that require ACR. Since the location of the UE has changed, this procedure results in unavailability of T-EESs that are relevant to the supplied applications and the new location of the UE.\n4.\tIf the change in the UE's location triggers a need to change the S-EAS but the EEC is not provided with a T-EAS, the EEC informs the AC of the unavailability of a suitable EDN for the new location of the UE.\n5.\tThe AC triggers the UE to perform DNS resolution for the CAS relevant for the AC. The UE may need to establish a new PDU connection to the CAS.\n6.\tThe AC sends ACR request to the EEC and the EEC responds ACR response to the AC.\n7.\tThe EEC performs ACR launching procedure (as described in clause 8.8.3.4) to the S-EES with the ACR action indicating ACR initiation and the corresponding ACR initiation data (along with the details of the CAS and without the need to notify the EAS). The S-EES may apply the AF traffic influence with the N6 routing information of the CAS in the 3GPP Core Network (if applicable), as described in clause 8.8.3.4. Based on the received CAS information, the S-EES informs the CAS with the S-EES endpoint information by selected EES declaration request as described in clause 8.8.3.10.\n8.\tThe AC is triggered by the EEC to start ACT. The AC decides to initiate the transfer of application context from the S-EAS to the CAS.\nAfter the ACT is completed, the AC remains connected to the CAS and disconnects from the S-EAS; the EEC is informed of the completion of the ACT.\nThe S-EAS or CAS can further decide to terminate the ACR, and the CAS can discard the application context (e.g. based on monitoring the location of the UE). It is up to the implementation of the S-EAS and CAS whether and how to make such a decision.\nPhase IV:\tPost-ACR Clean up\n9.\tSame as step 9 described for figure 8.8.2.2-1.\n10.\tSame as step 11 described for figure 8.8.2-1.\n8.8.2A.3\tEnabling ACR with CAS - EEC executed ACR via S-EES\nIn this scenario, the EEC is triggered as a result of the UE's movement as described in clause 8.8.1.1. Figure 8.8.2A.3-1 illustrates the EEC executing ACR via the S-EES.\nThis scenario description is same as described for figure 8.8.2.3-1 except for the following clarifications:\nPre-conditions: Same pre-conditions apply described for figure 8.8.2.3-1.\nFigure 8.8.2A.3-1: Enabling ACR with CAS - EEC executed ACR via S-EES\nPhase I: ACR Detection\n1.\tSame as step 1 described for figure 8.8.2.3-1.\nPhase II: ACR Decision\n2.\t Same as step 2 described for figure 8.8.2.3-1.\nPhase III:\tACR Execution\n3.\tThe EEC performs Service Provisioning (as specified in clause 8.3) for all active applications that require ACR. Since the location of the UE has changed, this procedure results in unavailability of T-EESs that are relevant to the supplied applications and the new location of the UE. Service provisioning or discovery of relevant T-EAS may not result in EES configuration or T-EAS is not discovered respectively. If no T-EES is available based on service provisioning response, the AC or EECtriggers the UE to perform DNS resolution for the cloud application server relevant for the AC as described in clause 8.14.2.5.3, 8.14.3.12 and 8.14.3.15. The UE may need to establish a new PDU connection to the CAS.\n4.\tThe EEC performs ACR launching procedure (as described in clause 8.8.3.4) to the S-EES with the ACR action indicating ACR initiation and the corresponding ACR initiation data (along with the details of the CAS and with the need to notify the EAS). The S-EES authorises the request from the EEC. The S-EES decides to execute ACR based on the information received from the EEC and/or EAS profile. The S-EES may apply the AF traffic influence with the N6 routing information of the CAS in the 3GPP Core Network (if applicable) and sends the ACR management notification for the \"ACT start\" event to the S-EAS, as described in clause 8.6.3, to initiate ACT between the S-EAS and the CAS. Based on the received CAS information, the S-EES informs the CAS with the S-EES endpoint information by selected EES declaration request as described in clause 8.8.3.10. If the EEC has not subscribed to receive ACR information notifications for ACR complete events from the S-EES, the EEC subscribes for the notifications as described in clause 8.8.3.5.2.\n5.\tThe S-EAS transfers the application context to the CAS at implementation specific time. This process is out of scope of the present specification.\nNOTE 1:\tThe S-EAS or CAS can further decide to terminate the ACR, and the CAS can discard the application context based on information received from EEL and/or other methods (e.g. monitoring the location of the UE). It is up to the implementation of the S-EAS and CAS whether and how to make such a decision.\nPhase IV:\tPost-ACR Clean up\n6.\tSame as step 7 described for figure 8.8.2.3-1.\n7.\tSame as step 9 described for figure 8.8.2.3-1.\nNOTE 2:\tThe CAS can perform capability exposure subscription with 3GPP CN directly, upon receiving the application context, which may be helpful for handling future ACR scenarios e.g. ACR from cloud to edge.\n8.8.2A.4\tEnabling ACR with CAS - S-EAS decided ACR\nIn this scenario, the S-EAS may detect the need of ACR locally or is notified by the S-EES via ACR management notifications for \"ACR monitoring\" events. The S-EAS make the decision about whether to perform the ACR, and starts the ACR at a proper time.\nThis scenario description is same as described for figure 8.8.2.4-1 except for the following clarifications:\nPre-conditions: Same pre-conditions apply described for figure 8.8.2.4-1.\nFigure 8.8.2A.4-1: Enabling ACR with CAS - S-EAS decided ACR scenario\nS-EAS decided ACR is outlined with four main phases: detection, decision, execution and clean up.\nPhase I: ACR Detection\n1.\tSame as step 1 described for figure 8.8.2.4-1.\nPhase II: ACR Decision\n2.\t Same as step 2 described for figure 8.8.2.4-1.\nPhase III:\tACR Execution\n3.\tIf the ACR required is self detected, the S-EAS requests the S-EES to discover the targets. When S-EES determines that no relevant EAS is available for the UE's location, the discovery response returns T-EAS discovery failure. After S-EAS determines to use CAS and performs the DNS query/discovery, the S-EAS may apply the AF traffic influence with the N6 routing information of the CAS in the 3GPP Core Network (if applicable).\n4.\tThe S-EAS sends selected CAS declaration message to S-EES, to inform S-EES the determined CAS to use as described in clause 8.8.3.7, where T-EAS in that procedure is assumed to be CAS. Based on the received CAS information, the S-EES informs the CAS with the S-EES endpoint information by selected EES declaration request as described in clause 8.8.3.10.\n5.\tBased on the CAS selection information received from the S-EAS, the S-EES sends the target information notification to the EEC as described in clause 8.8.3.5.3.\n6.\tThe S-EAS transfers the application context to the CAS selected in step 3. This process is out of scope of the present specification.\nNOTE 1:\tThe S-EAS or CAS can further decide to terminate the ACR, and the CAS can discard the application context based on information received from EEL and/or other methods (e.g. monitoring the location of the UE).

This may include EELManagedACR by S-EES when initiated by S-EAS as per clause 8.8.3.6.\nThis scenario description is same as described for figure 8.8.2.5-1 except for the following clarifications:\nPre-conditions: Same pre-conditions apply described for figure 8.8.2.5-1, with the clarification that T-EAS is CAS and pre-condition 5 for EELManagedACR is not applicable.\nFigure 8.8.2A.5-1: Enabling ACR with CAS - S-EES executed ACR\n1.\tSame as step 1 described for figure 8.8.2.5-1.\nPhase I: ACR Detection\n2.\tSame as step 2 described for figure 8.8.2.5-1.\nPhase II: ACR Decision\n3.\t Same as step 3 described for figure 8.8.2.5-1.\n4\t Same as step 4 described for figure 8.8.2.5-1.\nPhase III:\tACR Execution\n5.\tThe S-EES determines the targets via the Discover T-EAS procedure in clause 8.8.3.2.\nIf T-EAS discovery fails, then S-EES triggers DNS query message using the endpoint information (e.g., FQDN) in the S-EAS profile (e.g., EASID).\nBased on the determination of CAS, the S-EES informs the CAS with the S-EES endpoint information by selected EES declaration request as described in clause 8.8.3.10. For EELmanagedACR, the CAS subscribe to S-EES to receive ACT status notifications.\n6.\tSame as step 7 described for figure 8.8.2.5-1.\n7.\tThe S-EES may apply the AF traffic influence with the N6 routing information of the CAS in the 3GPP Core Network (if applicable).\n8.\tThe S-EES sends the ACR management notification (e.g. as notification for \"ACR facilitation\" event or \"ACT start\" event as described in clause 8.6.3 or due to step 1) to the S-EAS to initiate ACT between the S-EAS and the CAS.\n9.\tThe Application Context is transferred from S-EAS to the CAS at implementation specific time. In the case of EELManagedACR, the S-EES accesses the Application Context from the address as per step 1 and the S-EES either engage in the ACT from S-EAS to the CAS (obtained as per step 5) in a secure way. Further the CAS accesses the Application Context. The S-EAS may also perform the ACT directly with CAS, the specification of such process is out of scope of the present document.\nNOTE 1:\tThe Application Context is encrypted and protected by the application layer. The S-EES engages in the packet level transport of the Application Context and has no visibility to the content of the Application Context.\nNOTE 2:\tThe S-EAS or CAS can further decide to terminate the ACR, and the CAS can discard the application context based on information received from EEL and/or other methods (e.g. monitoring the location of the UE).

The CAS may send the EAS discovery request to the S-EES that selects an appropriate T-EES and T-EAS as per clause 8.8.3.2 where the CAS acts as a S-EAS.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tThe CAS has a business relationship with the ECSP, otherwise, the EES will reject the CAS request during authorization.\n-\tPrior to being connected to the CAS, the EEC was connected to an S-EES that may still hold its context and the CAS knows the S-EES (e.g. as in clause 8.8.3.10 when ACR is performed from EAS to CAS).\n-\tAC has obtained the UE ID as per clause 8.14.2.6 and forwarded it to the CAS while performing ACR from EAS to CAS as described in clause 8.8.2A.1 or the CAS knows UE ID having used the procedure defined in clause 8.6.5.\nFigure 8.8.2A.6-1: CAS decided ACR with T-EAS Discovery via S-EES\nPhase I: ACR Detection\n1.\tThe CAS detects the need for ACR. The CAS either receives ACR management notifications from S-EES indicating that ACR may be required (\"ACR monitoring\" event), or self detects the need for ACR (e.g. upon receipt of a \"user plane path change\" event).\nPhase II: ACR Decision\n2.\tThe CAS makes the decision to perform the ACR.\nPhase III: ACR Execution\n3.\tSame as steps 3 to 5 in clause 8.8.2.4 where the CAS acts as an S-EAS and it may provide the UE ID in the T-EAS discovery request for the S-EES to identify the UE during discovery. If ACR monitoring event is used in step 1, the T-EAS discovery in step 3 of clause 8.8.2.4 is skipped by the CAS.\n4.\tIf the S-EES can communicate with the EEC, step 6 from clause 8.8.2.4 is performed to notify the EEC of the selected T-EES. Otherwise, the notification is sent to the EEC via the SEAL notification management service as described in clause 9.1 if the EEC has subscribed to receive notifications from the S-EES or via Application Triggering via core network.\n5.\tSame as step 7 in clause 8.8.2.4 where the CAS acts as an S-EAS.\nPhase IV: Post-ACR Clean up\n6.\tSame as step 8 to step 9 in clause 8.8.2.4 where the CAS acts as an S-EAS.\n7.\tIf the S-EES can communicate with the EEC, step 10 from clause 8.8.2.4 is performed. Otherwise, the notification is sent to the EEC via the SEAL notification management service as described in clause 9.1 if the EEC has subscribed to receive notifications from the S-EES or via Application Triggering via core network.\n8.8.2B\tScenarios for ACR between EAS and CAS with CES\n8.8.2B.1\tGeneral\nSince the EAS may have service area restriction, once the UE is moving out of the current edge coverage, to keep service continuity, the application client needs to communicate with the CAS. The ACR can also be triggered in case of an overload situation or maintenance aspects in the S-EAS or EDN if no suitable target EAS is found as described in clause 8.8.1.1 depending on the scenario. Service continuity between CAS and EAS is supported with CES, corresponding to the architecture options described in clause 6.2d.\nCAS(s) are registered in the CES via CLOUD-1 reference point which enables the CES to provide appropriate CAS to S-EAS or S-EES.\nDNS can be used for CAS discovery by the UE.\nThe EES of the source EDN may interact with the CES via ECI-4 reference point and application context is transferred from source EAS to the CAS. Later, if the UE is moving to an area with edge coverage, the CES may interact with the EES in the target EDN via ECI-4 reference point and application context is transferred from the CAS to target EAS.\n8.8.2B.2\tACR from edge to cloud\n8.8.2B.2.1\tGeneral\nThe following clauses describe ACR scenarios from edge to cloud.\n8.8.2B.2.2\tInitiation by EEC using regular EAS Discovery\nThe scenario described in clause 8.8.2A.2 applies with the following differences:\n-\tAfter step 7, the S-EES relocates context to the CES.

      "content": "Figure 8.8.3.2-1 illustrates the procedure for fetching T-EAS information. This procedure may be utilized by a S-EAS, which undertakes the transfer of application context information to a T-EAS directly, or can be invoked by the S-EES itself on deciding to execute ACR.\nT-EAS discovery procedure also supports EAS retrieval which enables a S-EAS to obtain T-EAS(s) serving the application group so that the S-EAS can start communication with obtained EAS(s) for EAS synchronization.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tInformation related to the EES is available with the S-EAS, if the procedure is triggered by the S-EAS.\nFigure 8.8.3.2-1: Discover T-EAS\n1a.\tThe S-EAS sends the EAS discovery request to the S-EES or the S-EES decides to execute the ACR. The EAS discovery request from the S-EAS includes the requestor identifier [EASID] along with the security credentials and includes EAS discovery filter matching its EAS profile. If target DNAI is available at the S-EAS via User Plane Path change event, the S-EAS provides the S-EES with the target DNAI. The S-EAS also includes an EAS service continuity support indicator indicating that the S‑EAS decided ACR according to clause 8.8.2.4 is to be used for the ACR. The S-EAS includes the bundle ID and bundle type indicating the proxy bundle case to which the S-EAS belongs to. The request may include prediction expiration time.\nThe EAS may send EAS discovery request with EAS ID, Application Group ID and EAS synchronization support, which indicates the request to obtain EAS(s) currently serving the Application Group ID with the requested EAS ID in order to perform EAS synchronization.\nNOTE 1:\tThe trigger condition to invoke the Discover T-EAS API is up to application service logic, which is out of scope of this specification.\n1b.\tThe S-EES either receive the target DNAI for T-EES discovery from the step 1a or by the user plane management event notification from the core network.\n2.\tIf the request is received from the S-EAS, the S-EES checks whether the requesting EAS is authorized to perform the discovery operation.\nIf Application Group ID and EAS synchronization support in EAS characteristics are received and the ECS-ER is available, the S-EES checks with the ECS-ER with the received EAS ID and Application Group ID and obtains a list of EAS(s) supporting EAS synchronization and serving the application group for the desired application service identified by the EAS ID as described in clause 8.20. Step 2 to step 4 are skipped.\nIf the UE location is not known to the S-EES or provided by the S-EAS request, then the S-EES may interact with 3GPP core network to retrieve the UE location. If the S-EES decided to execute the ACR or when the requesting EAS is authorized, the S-EES checks if there exists a T-EAS information (registered or cached) that can satisfy the requesting EAS information, additional query filters and the Expected AC Service KPIs and the Minimum required AC Service KPIs if received from the EEC during the EAS discovery or from the S-EAS in step 1. In this case, the S-EES may collect Edge load performances from ADAES or OAM to find T-EAS(s) that satisfies the Expected AC service KPIs or the Minimum required AC Service KPIs. The S-EES may determine the use of statistics or prediction for evaluating KPIs based on the situation of the T-EAS discovery. If the S-EES finds the T-EAS(s) in the cached or registered information, the flow either continues with step 5 for the S-EAS triggered discovery or stops for the S-EES decided ACR execution, else the S-EES retrieves the T-EES address from the ECS as specified in clause 8.8.3.3 and continues with step 3.\n3.\tThe S-EES invokes the EAS discovery request on the T-EES retrieved from the ECS. The EAS discovery request includes the requestor identifier [EESID] along with the security credentials and includes EAS discovery filter. In the EAS discovery filter, the S-EES may include prediction expiration time, the Expected AC Service KPIs and the Minimum required AC Service KPIs if received from the EEC during the EAS discovery or from the S-EAS in step 1.\nThe S-EES also includes the EEC service continuity support indicator received from the EEC during EAS discovery. If in step 1 the S-EES received an EAS service continuity support indicator from the S-EAS, then the S-EES includes this EAS service continuity support indicator and its own EES service continuity support indicator indicating the ACR scenarios supported by the EES. If in step 1 the S-EES decided to execute the ACR, the S-EES includes the EAS service continuity support indicator received from the S-EAS during EAS registration and includes an EES service continuity support indicator indicating that the S‑EES executed ACR according to clause 8.8.2.5 is to be used for the ACR.\nUpon receiving the request, the T-EES may trigger the ECSP management system to instantiate the T-EAS that matches with EAS discovery filter IEs (e.g. ACID) as in clause 8.12.\n4.\tThe T-EES discovers the T-EAS(s) and responds with the discovered T-EAS information to the S-EES. To filter T-EAS(s), the T-EES utilizes the discovery filters (e.g. Expected AC Service KPIs and the Minimum required AC Service KPIs) and the indications which ACR scenarios are supported by the AC, the EEC, the T-EES and the S-EAS. If T-EES gets the Expected AC service KPIs or the Minimum required AC Service KPIs, the T-EES may collect edge load analytics from ADAES (as specified in clause 8.8.2 of TS 23.436 [28]) or performance data from OAM to find T-EAS(s) that satisfies the Expected AC service KPIs or the Minimum required AC Service KPIs. The T-EES may determine the use of statistics or prediction for evaluating KPIs based on the situation of the T-EAS discovery. The S-EES may cache the T-EAS information.\nWhen the bundle EAS information (i.e. list of EASID) is provided and the bundle type indicating the direct bundle, and the S-EES received associated T-EES(s) along with part of EAS ID list in the step2 from the ECS, then the S-EES discover the target direct bundle EAS(s) which belongs to same EDN for all the associated S-EES(s). The request message contains direct bundle EAS(s) information (i.e. list of EASID and direct bundle type), then the T-EES determines the direct bundle T-EAS(s) based on the bundle EAS information (e.g. list of EASIDs).

This procedure is also applicable for the CES to retrieve the T-EES information.\nPre-condition:\n1.\tThe S-EES has been pre-configured with the address of the ECS; and\n2.\tThe AC at the UE already has on-going application traffic with the S-EAS.\nFigure 8.8.3.3-1: Retrieve T-EES procedure\n1.\tThe S-EES sends the Retrieve EES request (UE location information or UE identity, EASID of the S-EAS, bundle ID, bundle type (i.e. proxy bundle case), target DNAI and UE connectivity information) to the ECS in order to identify the T-EES which has an EAS available to serve the given AC in the UE. For obtaining announcement EES list, the Retrieve EES request includes application group id. The request message may also contain the AC, EEC service continuity support information.\n2.\tIf the request contains the UE identity (e.g. GPSI) but the UE location is not known to the ECS, then the ECS interacts with 3GPP core network to retrieve the UE location. The ECS determines T-EES(s) as per the parameters (e.g. EASID, target DNAI) in the request and the UE location information. If the request message contains the AC, EEC service continuity support information, then the ECS may identify the T-EES taking the AC, EEC, T-EES service continuity support into consideration. When the bundle ID and is provided and bundle type indicating the proxy bundle case then the ECS can identify the T-EES based on the bundle ID in the EES profile and in the request message to ensure T-EAS is able to invoke the required proxy bundle EAS(s) as the S-EAS does.\nIf no ECS-ER is available and when the Retrieve EES request includes application group id to the ECS then the request EES list retrieval is for the announcement of common EAS, ECS determines the list of EESs serving the EASs (with same EASID) for the Group ID included in the Retrieve EES request.\nIf the ECS does not identify any suitable EES(s) based on EDN configuration available at the ECS and UE’s location, the ECS determines a partner ECS that may satisfy the requirements. Based on ECSP policy, the ECS may use preconfigured or OAM configured information about the partner ECSs or ECS discovery via ECS-ER as specified in clause 8.17.2.3 or both.\nIf required by the ECSP policies, the ECS may use service provisioning information retrieval procedure as specified in clause 8.17.2.4 to obtain service provisioning information from the partner ECS.\nWhen the bundle EAS information is provided, then if bundle EAS information includes a list of EASIDs, then the ECS identifies the one or more T-EES associated with the same EDN which support all of the EASs within the same EDN based on the EES EDN information obtained in the EES profile and bundle EAS information (e.g. list of EASIDs).\nNOTE 1:\tT-EES(s) may belongs to same EDN.\n3.\tThe ECS sends the Retrieve EES response. If the ECS has determined the EDN configuration information, the retrieve EES response includes the list of EDN configuration information to the S-EES. The list of EDN configuration information includes the EDN details with the endpoint information of T-EES(s) as described in table 8.3.3.3.3-2. If the ECS has determined suitable partner ECS(s) instead, the retrieve EES response includes a list of ECS configuration information.\nThe ECS may provide associated T-EES(s) information (one or more T-EES information) to the S-EES in the Retrieve T-EES response along with the bundle EAS information (i.e. list of EASIDs). When S-EES receives multiple associated T-EES(s), then each associated T-EES information is provided along with the part of the EAS ID list.\nIf the retrieve EES response contains a list of ECS configuration information, the S-EES may initiate retrieve T-EES procedure with one or more ECS(s) listed in the retrieve EES response.\nNOTE 2:\tThe Retrieve EES request initiated by the S-EES can be restricted only to its registered ECS.",

The ACR request message may include Predicted/Expected UE location or Expected AC Geographical Service Area to indicate that the EES should detect whether the UE has moves to the Predicted/Expected UE location or Expected AC Geographical Service Area or not in ACR clean-up phase. The ACR request message includes ACR action to indicate either ACR initiation request or ACR determination request. If the procedure is triggered by the S‑EAS, the ACR request message is only for ACR determination.\nAn ACR request for ACR initiation sent by the EEC:\n-\tincludes an indication of whether the EEC requests the EES to perform EAS notification; and\n-\tprovides information used by EES to perform AF traffic influence as in 3GPP TS 23 501 [2]. The EEC sent ACR request for ACR initiation shall include the simultaneous EAS connectivity information in service continuity (see table 8.8.4.4-1) if previously received as part of the AC profile.\nAn ACR request for ACR determination sent either by the EEC or the EAS informs the EES that the need for ACR has been detected by the requestor.\nAn ACR request for ACR modification sent by the EEC:\n-\tincludes IDs to identify the ACR that is requested to be modified; and\n-\tincludes the ACR parameters to be modified.\nAn ACR request for direct bundle EAS case sent by the S-EES:\n-\tincludes direct bundle T-EAS(s) received in step 4 in 8.8.3.2 related to the associated S-EES(s) based on the EASID, which EASID of the associated S-EES is corresponding to the direct bundle T-EAS(s) profile.\n2.\tThe EES checks if the requestor is authorized for this operation. If authorized, the EES processes the request and performs the required operations.\nIf the request in step 1 is for ACR initiation:\n-\tthe EES may use information provided in the request to apply the AF traffic influence with the N6 routing information of the T-EAS in the 3GPP Core Network (if applicable), as described in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2], clause 5.6.7.1; and\nNOTE 1:\tThe simultaneous EAS connectivity information sent by EES is used to maintain both S-PSA and T-PSA in supporting simultaneous connectivity with both S-EAS and T-EAS during the service continuity as described in clause 6.3.4 of 3GPP TS 23.548 [20].\nNOTE 2:\tThe EES acting as AF cannot be aware of if it is supported before invoking AF traffic influence API. If the EES is notified from the 3GPP CN that the simultaneous EAS connectivity is not supported as described in 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] during the invocation procedure of AF traffic influence API, then the EES can know that the simultaneous EAS connectivity is not supported and provide the response indicating simultaneous EAS connectivity unsupported to the EAS or EEC.\n-\tif the EAS notification indication in ACR initiation data is provided in the step 1 request and the EAS has subscribed to receive such notification, the EES shall notify the EAS indicated in the ACR initiation data about the need to start ACR by sending an ACR management notification for the \"ACT start\" event, as described in clause 8.6.3.\nIf the request in step 1 is for ACR determination, the EES decides to execute ACR as described in clause 8.8.2.5.\nIf the request in step 1 includes Previous T-EAS Endpoint:\n-\tif the previous EAS notification indication is provided in the step 1 request and the EAS has subscribed to receive such notification, the EES shall notify the EAS about the cancellation of the ACR with the previous T-EAS by sending an ACR management notification for the \"ACT stop\" event, as described in clause 8.6.3.\n-\tThe EAS will inform the remote EAS about application context cancellation, which is outside the scope of this specification.

If the request in step 1 is to the S-EES, the S-EES performs the ACR parameter information procedure as described in clause 8.8.3.9. If the request in step 1 is to the T-EES, and if the T-EAS has subscribed to receive ACR notifications, the T-EES shall notify the T-EAS by sending an ACR management notification, with \"ACT start\" event including ACR parameters from the request in step 1, e.g. Prediction expiration time.\nIf the request in step1 is for direct bundle EAS case, then the associated T-EES may use received direct bundle T-EAS(s) for ACR.\n3.\tThe EES responds to the requestor's request with an ACR response message.\nIf the request in step 1 includes simultaneous EAS connectivity information in service continuity and if the EES is notified from the 3GPP CN that the simultaneous EAS connectivity is not supported as described in 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] and step 2, then the EES provides the response indicating that simultaneous EAS connectivity is not supported to the S-EAS or EEC.\nIn case of re-sending ACR initiation, if serving EES was changed and EEC context was relocated, the T-EES can clean up any relocated EEC context either indicated in the re-sent ACR request for scenario described in clause 8.8.2.6 or upon reception of the ACR status update with failed result from T-EAS for other scenarios.",

If the EEC indicates EAS Instantiation Triggering Suppress in EAS discovery request and EAS discovery subscription request, then the EES does not trigger EAS instantiation.\nUpon receiving EEC Registration request with bundle EAS information the EES may determine that only a subset of the EAS(s) in the bundle are registered and instantiated. If only a subset of bundle EASs is determined, the EES may trigger the ECSP management system to instantiate the subset of remaining EASs corresponding to the bundle that can be instantiable before responding to the registration request.\nUpon receiving one or more EAS discovery subscription request(s) for the availability of an EAS, EES may determine if there is a need for EAS instantiation based on the information about instantiable EASs. If such a need for EAS instantiation determined, EES may send a report for a need of the EAS instantiation to the ECSP management system to consider instantiating the requested EAS by invoking an MnS API of the ECSP management system. When the requested EAS has been instantiated, the EES may obtain the EAS profile during the EAS registration procedure and notify the availability change event of the requested EAS with the EAS profile to the corresponding EECs via the EAS discovery notification procedure as specified in the clause 8.5.2.3.\nUpon receiving the EAS information provisioning request, the EES may trigger the ECSP management system to instantiate the EAS in the EDN before returning the EAS information to the EEC.\nNOTE 1:\tThe ECSP management system is responsible for the authorization of the dynamic EAS instantiation.\nNOTE 2:\tThe ECSP management system can provide the information about instantiable EASs to the EES. Such a mechanism is out of scope of this release of the present document.\nNOTE 3:\tWhen determining a need for EAS instantiation, EES can further consider the requested service characteristics (e.g. location, latency) by EEC or service load/capacity (e.g. number of service sessions) of EAS, which is upon implementation and out the scope of this specification.\nNOTE 4:\tThe details for EAS instantiation provided by the ECSP management system is specified in clause 7.1.2 of 3GPP TS 28.538 [22].",

When Application Group information is not provided, the EES determines that the EAS in the request is providing services to the AC with the indicated ACID e.g. for EEC Context handling purposes as described in clause 8.9. When Application Group information is included in the request, the EAS provided is considered Common EAS for the Application Group.\nNOTE 2:\tFurther clarification for EAS selection may be needed.\nIf the EEC or EES selected ACR scenario list for EAS bundle includes EAS executed ACR scenario (as described in 8.8.2.8), the EES also sends DNAIs and service area of the selected EAS(s) to the main EAS in the ACR selection notification.\nThe request may contain the associated EES(s) information along with the bundle EAS information (i.e. list of EASID) and the bundle EAS type indicating direct bundle, each associated EES(s) is along with part of or all the list of EASID, when EEC determines the associated EES(s) based on the EDN configuration information and bundle EAS information (e.g. list of EASID and direct bundle type).\nIf the request contains selected EAS ID and selected EAS Endpoint, the EES may apply the EAS traffic influence with the N6 routing information of the EAS in the 3GPP Core Network, based on application KPIs and if the EAS traffic influence was not done before (e.g. neither in EAS discovery procedure nor the EAS perform traffic influence).\nWhen the selection is that of a common EAS for application group, the request message may contain the list of EESs for a certain Application Group ID, received from the ECS in the service provisioning response message. This application group related information may be used for further common EAS announcement(s) between EES(s). In the case of no ECS-ER, if the request message does not contain the list of EESs for a certain Application Group ID, then the EES determines the other EESs to which announce common EAS request needs to be sent as described in clause 8.8.3.3. If there is ECS-ER, the EEC selected EAS is used in interaction between the EES and ECS-ER, as described in clause 8.20.2.3 to store the common EAS information., If the ECS-ER provides a different common EAS information in the response it is forwarded to the EEC in the EAS information provisioning response. If the ECS-ER-provided common EAS is registered to another EES, then the EES endpoint of the EES where the common EAS is registered is also included in the EAS information provisioning response.\nIf the request contains the selected EASID and the selected EAS endpoint is not included, the EES verifies if instantiation of EAS is needed and may trigger the ECSP management system to instantiate the EAS as in clause 8.12.\nWhen the request contains EEC Service Continuity Support IE and the EEC context has been established, the EES includes the IE into the EEC context described in Table 8.2.8-1.\nNOTE 2:\tEES can also influence the EAS traffic in advance.\nNOTE 3:\tIt is up to the AC to decide when to connect to the selected EAS (either immediately or wait for a while) once the AC knows the selected EAS.\n3.\tIf the processing of the request was successful, the EES sends an EAS information provisioning response to the EEC indicating a successful status. If an EEC context has been established, the response also includes the list of selected ACR scenario(s) into the session context IE within EEC context as described in Table 8.2.8-2; otherwise, the EES shall indicate a failure status and include appropriate reasons. If the EES has triggered EAS instantiation based on the EAS information provisioning request and obtained the newly instantiated EAS information, the response contains information about the newly instantiated EAS, including the EAS endpoint information.\nThe EEC, EES and EAS (or the bundled EAS(s)) use the selected ACR scenario list to determine if they should perform ACR detection and/or ACR decision.\nUpon receiving the EAS information provisioning response, if the response includes instantiated EAS information, the EEC uses the endpoint information to subscribe to ACR event notification, as needed, and provides necessary notifications to the AC.\nNOTE 4:\tOther ACR selection criteria are out of scope of the current specification.\nNOTE 5:\tThe common supported ACR scenarios is decided as part of the EAS discovery and selection procedure.\nFor the \"EAS selection\" case, in the case of no ECS-ER, the selected common EAS shall be announced to other relevant EES(s) as per procedure in clause 8.19.",

Use of non-dedicated DN\nThere is no Edge-dedicated DN for support of edge computing service. A DN common to other services (e.g. internet access) is used to connect to the EASs.\nThe PLMN supporting edge computing services provides connection to EASs located in EDNs that respectively corresponds to one or more DNAI(s), and each EDN is identified by DNN and one or more DNAI. UEs establishing PDU sessions for the EASs identify the DN using the same DNN and slice information as for PDU sessions for non-Edge services.\nEach EAS and EES can have a topological service area or a geographical service area that the EAS and EES serves, respectively. Within this service area, UEs can access an EAS or an EES regardless of their location within the PLMN area via local breakout.\nFigure A.2.2-1: Option 1: Use of non-dedicated DN\nA.2.3\tOption 2. Use of Edge-dedicated DN\nThe deployment uses Edge-dedicated DNs for support of edge computing service. Each Edge-dedicated DN is configured with unique DNNs.\nThe PLMN supporting edge computing services provides connection to several EDNs that correspond to one or more DNAI(s), and each EDN is identified by DNN of the Edge-dedicated DN and one or more DNAI.\nFigure A.2.3-1: Option 2: Use of Edge-dedicated DN\nA.2.4\tOption 3. Use of LADN\nEdge computing services can be provided via Edge-dedicated Data Networks deployed as LADNs. With this option, the PLMN supports edge computing services in the EDN service areas which is equal to the LADN service area. The LADN service area is the service area that the Edge Computing is supported. Each individual EAS in the LADN can support the same or smaller service area than the LADN.\nFigure A.2.4-1: Option 3: Use of LADN(s)\nA.3\tECS deployments in relation to the UE\nA.3.1\tGeneral\nThis clause shows some examples for how the ECS can be deployed in relation to the UE\nA.3.2\tUE (EEC) served by a single ECS\nIn this scenario the UE can contain a single AC or multiple ACs, however the UE contains a single EEC which is configured with the address of a single ECS. This could for example be an IoT device that only supports a single AC or a smartphone device which contains many ACs which are served by a single ECS.\nA.3.3\tUE (EECs) served by multiple ECSs\nIn this scenario the user is allowed to install multiple ACs in the UE where each AC can be served by an EAS which in turn served by a different ECSP's EES/ECS.\nOne example is that multiple ACs are installed on a smartphone and the associated EASs are on-boarded onto different ECSP's EESs which are registered with different ECSs.\nAnother example is a UE that supports Dual SIM. In this scenario the UE can support concurrent connection to two PLMNs.\nA.4\tDeployment of EES in relation with SEAL services and Application Enabler Services\nA.4.1\tGeneral\nThe illustration of layered application architecture with the generic SEAL and Application Enabler server functions available in the cloud is shown in Figure A.4.1-1.\nFigure A.4.1-1: Illustration of a layered application architecture with generic SEAL and Application Enabler server functions available in the cloud\nThe examples of application specific client are V2X application specific client, FF application specific client, UAS application specific client or other vertical application specific client residing on the UE. Similarly, the application specific server could be e.g. V2X application specific server, FF application specific server, UAS application specific server or other vertical application specific server.\nThe UE may consist of an application enabler client. The examples of application enabler client include V2X application enabler client, FF application enabler client, UAS application enabler client or other vertical application enabler client residing on the UE. Similarly, the application enabler server could be V2X application enabler server, FF application enabler Server, UAS application enabler server or other vertical application enabler server.\nThe illustration of layered application architecture with generic SEAL and Application Enabler server functions available in the edge is shown in Figure A.4.1-2.\nFigure A.4.1-2: Illustration of layered application architecture with generic SEAL and Application Enabler server functions available in the edge\nWhile the server functions of an application specific server can be made available only as an EAS, it is also possible that certain application specific server functions are available both at the edge and in the cloud. Similarly, the server functions of an application enabler server can be made available only as an EAS, it is also possible that certain application enabler server functions are available both at the edge and in the cloud. When the server functions of an application are both available at the edge and the cloud, there may be a need for interaction between the two corresponding application servers, which is out of scope of this specification.\nNOTE 1:\tThe details of a specific vertical application architecture based on the generic layered application architecture with server functions of an application available in the edge and the cloud is out of scope of this specification.\nNOTE 2:\tWhen UE is in the coverage of the EDN due to which certain server functions are available both at the edge and in the cloud, then whether UE connects to the server functions available at the edge or directly to the cloud is out of scope of the present document.\nA.4.2\tDeployment of SEAL services\nThere are several options to support SEAL service APIs to be exposed to the EAS.\nThe EES can act as the CAPIF core function, and the SEAL servers acting the AEF and publish the SEAL service API to the EES. Further, the SEAL service APIs is discovered by the EASs acting as the API invoker during the service API discover procedure as specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [6].\nThe EES can act as the API topology hiding entry and re-expose SEAL service APIs as specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [13] to EAS via EDGE-3 which utilizes the CAPIF-2/2e reference point as specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [6].\nA.4.3\tDeployment of Application Enabler services\nThere are several options to support vertical application enabler server (e.g., V2X application enabler server) APIs to be exposed to the EAS.\nThe EES can act as the CAPIF core function, and the vertical application enabler server acting the AEF and publish the vertical application enabler server APIs to the EES. Further, the vertical application enabler server APIs is discovered by the EASs acting as the API invoker during the service API discover procedure as specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [6].\nThe EES can act as the API topology hiding entry and re-exposes vertical application enabler server APIs, e.g., VAE server APIs as specified in 3GPP TS 23.286 [14] to EAS via EDGE-3 which utilizes the CAPIF-2/2e reference point as specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [6].\nA.5\tDeployments in relation with CAPIF\nA.5.1\tGeneral\nA.5.2\tDistributed CAPIF core functions\nThe EES can support EAS's access to northbound APIs exposed by SCEF/NEF by providing distributed CAPIF core functions as shown in Figure A.5.2-1.\nFigure A.5.2-1: EES supporting distributed CAPIF core functions\nThe EDNs reside outside the PLMN trust domain as shown in Figure A.5.2-1. In EDN 2, the EAS and EES are within the same ECSP trust domain. While in EDN 1, the EES and the EAS are in the different ECSP trust domain.\nThe EES of an EDN provides the following functions for network capability exposure:\n-\tthe CAPIF core function as specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [6] to support onboarding of EASs (API invokers), publish of service APIs, discovery of service APIs and charging of service APIs invocations; and\n-\tthe API exposing function as specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [6] to expose the service APIs from SCEF/NEF to the EASs via proxy or gateway function.\nThe following procedures are performed as specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [6]:\n-\tThe SCEF and NEF act as API exposing function and the service APIs from SCEF (T8) and NEF (Nnef) are published to the CAPIF core function 1. The service APIs are published to the EESs (CAPIF core function 2 and CAPIF core function 3) from the CAPIF core function 1.\n-\tThe EAS acts as an API invoker and is onboarded to the EES (CAPIF core function 2 or CAPIF core function 3) within the EDN.\n-\tThe EASs (API invokers) are authenticated with EES (CAPIF core function 2 or CAPIF core function 3).\nNOTE:\tThe trusted EASs can utilize the services of a centralized CAPIF core function deployed by the PLMN operator instead of the CAPIF core function of EES deployed within the EDN.\n-\tThe EAS discovers the service APIs published by the SCEF and NEF via the EES (CAPIF core function 2 or CAPIF core function 3) within the EDN including the end point address of the API exposing function where the service API invocation is to be performed.\n-\tThe EAS obtains authorization to invoke the service APIs of the SCEF and NEF from the EES (CAPIF core function 2 or CAPIF core function 3).\n-\tThe EAS invokes the service APIs of the SCEF and NEF after authorization by the EES (API exposing function) and obtaining the UE identifier as specified in clause 8.6.5. The EES (API exposing function) further invokes the service APIs of the SCEF or NEF in the 3GPP core network. EDGE-2 supports CAPIF-7e interactions corresponding to T8 (for SCEF) and N33 (for NEF).\nA.5.3\tCentralized CAPIF core function\nThe EES can support EAS (owned by 3rd party or by PLMN operator) access to northbound APIs exposed by SCEF/NEF by using centralized CAPIF core functions as shown in Figure A.5.3-1.\nFigure A.5.3-1: EES supporting centralized CAPIF core functions\nThe EDNs reside outside the PLMN trust domain as shown in Figure A.5.3-1. In EDN 2, the EAS and EES are within the same ECSP trust domain. While in EDN 1, the EES and the EAS are in the different ECSP trust domain.\nThe EES of an EDN provides the following functions for network capability exposure:\n-\tthe API exposing function as specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [6] to expose the service APIs from SCEF/NEF to the EASs via proxy or gateway function.\nThe following procedures are performed as specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [6]:\n-\tThe SCEF and NEF act as API exposing function and the service APIs from SCEF (T8) and NEF (Nnef) are published to the centralized CAPIF core function. The service APIs exposed by the EESs are published to the centralized CAPIF core function.\n-\tThe EAS acts as an API invoker and is onboarded to the centralized CAPIF core function residing outside of the EDN.\n-\tThe EASs (API invokers) are authenticated with the centralized CAPIF core function.\n-\tThe EAS discovers the service APIs published by the SCEF and NEF via the centralized CAPIF core function including the end point address of the API exposing function where the service API invocation is to be performed.\n-\tThe EAS obtains authorization to invoke the service APIs of the SCEF and NEF from the centralized CAPIF core function.\n-\tThe EAS invokes the service APIs of the SCEF and NEF after authorization by the EES (API exposing function) and obtaining the UE identifier as specified in clause 8.6.5. The EES (API exposing function) further invokes the service APIs of the SCEF or NEF in the 3GPP core network. EDGE-2 supports CAPIF-7e interactions corresponding to T8 (for SCEF) and N33 (for NEF).\nA.5.4\tSupporting Exposure of EAS Service APIs using CAPIF\nThe EES provides support for an EAS to expose its Service APIs (i.e., EAS Service APIs) for consumption by the other EASs by providing CAPIF functions as shown in Figure A.5.4-1.\nFigure A.5.4-1: EES supporting CAPIF functions for exposure of EAS Service APIs\nIn EDN 1, all the EESs are within the same ECSP trust domain. The EASs (EAS 1 and EAS 2 as API providers) are within the same ECSP trust domain and EAS 3 (API provider) is within the 3rd-party trust domain. The 3rd party EASs (API invoker) connected to EES 2 (CCF 2) are within the same ECSP trust domain, whereas the 3rd party EASs (API invoker) connected to EES 1 (CCF 1) are outside the ECSP trust domain.\nThe EES of an EDN provides the following functions for exposure of EAS Service APIs:\n-\tThe CAPIF core function as specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [6] to support onboarding of EASs (API invokers), publish of EAS Service APIs, discovery of EAS Service APIs, and charging of EAS Service APIs invocations.\nThe following procedures are performed as specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [6]:\n-\tThe EAS (API provider) acts as an API provider by supporting API provider domain functions (i.e., API exposing function, API publishing function, and API management function), and its Service APIs are published to the EES (CAPIF core function 1 or CAPIF core function 2).\n-\tThe EESs (CAPIF core function 1 or CAPIF core function 2) further publishes the EAS Service APIs to CAPIF core function 3 which assumes the role of a centralized repository of EAS service APIs in the EDN 1 to support discovery of the EAS Service APIs across different EESs (EES 1 and EES 2) using CAPIF-6 for interconnection operations as shown in Figure A.5.4-1.\n-\tThe EAS (API invokers) discovers the EAS Service API(s) via CAPIF core function 1 or CAPIF core function 2 (deployed with the EESs) including the end point address of the API exposing function where the service API invocation is to be performed.\nNOTE 1:\tEES supporting CAPIF core function may also provide the support for logging, audit, and access control of EAS Service API(s) as specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [6].\nNOTE 2: \tThe other CAPIF operations (e.g., onboarding, authentication, authorization) are the same as specified in the Annex A.5.2.\nAnnex B (Informative):Involved entities and relationships\nB.1\tGeneral\nThis clause describes the relationship of edge computing service providers, PLMN operators, application service providers and users.\nFigure B-1: Relationships involved in edge computing service\nThe end user is the consumer of the applications provided by the application service provider (ASP) and can have ASP service agreement with a single or multiple application service providers. The end user has a PLMN subscription arrangement with the PLMN operator. The UE used by the end user is allowed to be registered on the PLMN operator network.\nThe application service provider consumes the edge services (e.g. infrastructure, platform) provided by the edge computing service provider (ECSP) and can have edge computing service provider service agreement with a single or multiple edge computing service providers.\nA single PLMN operator can have the PLMN operator service agreement with a single or multiple edge computing service providers.\nA single ECSP can have PLMN operator service agreement with a single or multiple PLMN operators which provide edge computing support.\nThe edge computing service provider and the PLMN operator can be part of the same organization.\nB.2\tFederation and Roaming\nThis clause describes the relationship of edge computing service providers, PLMN operators, application service providers and end users, taking federation and roaming into account.\nFigure B.2-1: Relationships involved in edge computing service – federation and roaming\nThe end user is the consumer of the applications provided by the application service provider (ASP). The End user:\n-\tcan have ASP service agreement with a single or multiple application service providers.\n-\thas a PLMN subscription arrangement with a PLMN operator (HPLMN), and the UE used by the end user can register on the HPLMN network and network of its roaming partners; or has a SNPN subscription arrangement with a SNPN operator (subscribed SNPN), and the UE used by the end user can register on the subscribed SNPN and a serving SNPN.\n-\tcan have authorization to access edge services of a single or multiple ECSPs.\nThe ASP consumes the edge services (e.g. infrastructure, platform) provided by the ECSP. The ASP:\n-\tcan have edge computing service provider service agreement with a single or multiple ECSPs.\nThe PLMN operator provides connectivity between the end user and the edge services provided by the ECSP. The PLMN operator:\n-\tcan have the PLMN operator service agreement with a single or multiple ECSPs.\n-\tcan have service agreement for roaming including agreements for Edge Computing services, and/or federation with a single or multiple PLMN operators.\nThe ECSP provides the edge services. The ECSP:\n-\tcan have PLMN operator service agreement with a single or multiple PLMN operators which provide edge computing support.\n-\tcan have federation partnership to share edge services with a single or multiple ECSPs.\nThe ECSP and the PLMN operator can be part of the same organization.\nB.3\tApplication Groups\nThis clause describes the relationship of edge computing service providers, PLMN operators, application service providers, application client instances, application server instances, and UEs for a group of application clients being served by a common application server. Figure B.3-1 shows these relationships in terms of roles, entities, and application data traffic.\nFigure B.3-1: Relationships involved in application clients served by a common server\nThe application service provider controls app_3 in all locations, including at different ECSPs, and provides application clients to end users. The Application Group ID links a server and clients that are all part of the application service \"app_3\".\nThe Application Group ID is unique within the application service. For a given application, no two groups of application clients share the same Application Group ID. Application Group ID is unique across ECSPs and PLMNs, i.e. the Application Group ID alone is sufficient to identify the group in Figure B-X (without any ECSP, PLMN, or EAS identifiers).\n\"client_app_3\" and \"server_app_3\" indicate client and server instances running on the UE and the EAS respectively, they are not identities such as ACID, EAS ID that are used in the procedures defined in this specification.\nBob's UE and Carol's UE can be thought of as being in the same group but could also simultaneously be in other groups unrelated to app_3. An app_3 group being simultaneously provided to other app_3 clients will use a different Application Group ID. In all cases, the ASP is the single point of control of Application Group ID.\nAnnex C (Informative):Relationship with ETSI MEC architecture\nThe content of this clause has been captured in TR
