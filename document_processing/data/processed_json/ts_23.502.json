The UE initiates the Registration procedure using one of the following Registration types:\n-\tInitial Registration to the 5GS;\n-\tMobility Registration Update upon changing to a new Tracking Area (TA) outside the UE's Registration Area in both CM-CONNECTED and CM-IDLE state, or when the UE needs to update its capabilities or protocol parameters that are negotiated in Registration procedure with or without changing to a new TA, or a change in the UE's Preferred Network Behaviour that would create an incompatibility with the Supported Network Behaviour provided by the serving AMF, or when the UE intends to retrieve LADN Information, or with NR satellite access upon changing to a suitable cell indicating multiple TAs for the RPLMN all of which are outside the UE's Registration Area in both CM-CONNECTED and CM-IDLE state, or when the Multi-USIM UE needs a new 5G-GUTI assignment, or when the UE needs to indicate or returns from an Unavailability Period (see clause 5.4.1.4 of TS 23.501 [2]), or when the UE using a RAN that provides discontinuous coverage (e.g. for satellite access with discontinuous coverage) is about to leave the satellite network coverage as described in clause 5.4.13.1 of TS 23.501 [2], or when the UE has informed the network it is unreachable and now returns to coverage using either satellite or terrestrial access as described in clause 5.4.1.4 of TS 23.501 [2]; or\n-\tPeriodic Registration Update (due to a predefined time period of inactivity); or\n-\tEmergency Registration; or\n-\tDisaster Roaming Initial Registration, as specified in clause 5.40 of TS 23.501 [2]; or\n-\tDisaster Roaming Mobility Registration Update, as specified in clause 5.40 of TS 23.501 [2]; or\n-\tSNPN Onboarding Registration allows the UE to access an ON-SNPN for the purpose of provisioning the UE with SO-SNPN credentials to enable SO-SNPN access. SNPN Onboarding Registration is only applicable for registration with ON-SNPN i.e. when the UE uses PLMN credentials for accessing an ONN the UE initiates an Initial Registration. The SNPN Onboarding Registration is specified in clause 4.2.2.2.4.\nNOTE 1:\tWith NR satellite access, more than one TAC can be indicated to a UE for each PLMN in any cell.\nThe General Registration call flow in clause 4.2.2.2.2 applies on all these Registration procedures, but the periodic registration need not include all parameters that are used in other registration cases.\nThe following are the cleartext IEs, as defined in TS 24.501 [25] that can be sent by the UE in the Registration Request message if the UE has no NAS security context:\n-\tRegistration type;\n-\tSUCI or 5G-GUTI or PEI;\n-\tSecurity parameters;\n-\tadditional GUTI;\n-\t4G Tracking Area Update;\n-\tthe indication that the UE is moving from EPS;\n-\tPLMN with Disaster Condition;\n-\tif the UE is registering with an SNPN, the NID of the SNPN that assigned the 5G-GUTI.\nNOTE 2:\tThe NID is provided when the 5G-GUTI is assigned by another SNPN than the selected SNPN.\nAspects related to dual registration in 3GPP and non-3GPP access are described in clause 4.12. The general Registration call flow in clause 4.2.2.2.2 is also used for the case of registration in 3GPP access when the UE is already registered in a non-3GPP access and vice versa. Registration in 3GPP access when the UE is already registered in a non-3GPP access scenario may require an AMF change, as further detailed in clause 4.12.8.\nThe general Registration call flow in clause 4.2.2.2.2 is also used by UEs in limited service state (see TS 23.122 [22]) registering for emergency services only (referred to as Emergency Registration), see clause 5.16.4 of TS 23.501 [2].\nDuring the initial registration the PEI is obtained from the UE. If the PEI is needed (e.g. for EIR check), the AMF shall retrieve the PEI when it establishes the NAS security context with a Security Mode Command during initial registration. The AMF operator may check the PEI with an EIR. If the PEI was retrieved by the AMF (either from the UE or another AMF), AMF shall provide it to the UDM using Nudm_UECM_Registration in order to ensure that the UDM always has the latest PEI available e.g. for reporting event Change of SUPI-PEI association. The AMF passes the PEI to the UDM, to the SMF and the PCF. The UDM may store this data in UDR by Nudr_SDM_Update.\nNOTE 3:\tThe use of NSI ID in the 5GC is optional and depends on the deployment choices of the operator.\nDuring the registration the Home Network (or Credentials Holder in case of access to an SNPN) can provide Steering of Roaming information to the UE via the AMF (i.e. a list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations and/or Credentials Holder controlled prioritized lists of preferred SNPNs and GINs and/or Credentials Holder controlled prioritized lists of preferred SNPNs and GINs for accessing Localized Services or HPLMN/Credentials Holder indication that 'no change of the above list(s) stored in the UE is needed'). The Home Network can include an indication for the UE to send an acknowledgement of the reception of this information. Details regarding the handling of Steering of Roaming information including how this information is managed between the AMF and the UE are defined in TS 23.122 [22].\nThe AMF determines Access Type and RAT Type as defined in clause 5.3.2.3 of TS 23.501 [2].",

The Establishment cause provides the reason for requesting the establishment of an RRC connection. Whether and how the UE includes the NSSAI information as part of the AN parameters is dependent on the value of the Access Stratum Connection Establishment NSSAI Inclusion Mode parameter, as specified in clause 5.15.9 of TS 23.501 [2].\nThe AN parameters shall also include an IAB-Indication if the UE is an IAB-node accessing 5GS.\nThe AN parameters shall also include a MBSR Indication if the UE is part of an MBSR node accessing 5GS attempting MBSR operation in the PLMN as specified in clause 5.35A.1 of TS 23.501 [2].\nThe Registration type indicates if the UE wants to perform an Initial Registration (i.e. the UE is in RM-DEREGISTERED state), a Mobility Registration Update (i.e. the UE is in RM-REGISTERED state and initiates a Registration procedure due to mobility or due to the UE needs to update its capabilities or protocol parameters, or to request a change of the set of network slices it is allowed to use), a Periodic Registration Update (i.e. the UE is in RM-REGISTERED state and initiates a Registration procedure due to the Periodic Registration Update timer expiry, see clause 4.2.2.2.1), an Emergency Registration (i.e. the UE is in limited service state), a Disaster Roaming Initial Registration, or a Disaster Roaming Mobility Registration Update.\nWhen the UE is using E-UTRA, the UE indicates its support of CIoT 5GS Optimisations, which is relevant for the AMF selection, in the RRC connection establishment signalling associated with the Registration Request.\nWhen the UE is performing an Initial Registration or a Disaster Roaming Registration the UE shall indicate its UE identity in the Registration Request message as follows, listed in decreasing order of preference in the case of registration with a PLMN:\ni)\ta 5G-GUTI mapped from an EPS GUTI, if the UE has a valid EPS GUTI.\nii)\ta native 5G-GUTI assigned by the PLMN to which the UE is attempting to register, if available;\niii)\ta native 5G-GUTI assigned by an equivalent PLMN to the PLMN to which the UE is attempting to register, if available;\niv)\ta native 5G-GUTI assigned by any other PLMN, if available; or\nNOTE 2:\tThis can also be a 5G-GUTIs assigned via another access type.\nv)\tOtherwise, the UE shall include its SUCI in the Registration Request as defined in TS 33.501 [15].\nIf the UE is registering with an SNPN, when the UE is performing an Initial Registration the UE shall indicate its UE identity in the Registration Request message as follows, listed in decreasing order of preference:\ni)\ta native 5G-GUTI assigned by the same SNPN to which the UE is attempting to register, if available;\nii)\ta native 5G-GUTI assigned by an equivalent SNPN to the SNPN to which the UE is attempting to register along with the NID of the SNPN that assigned the 5G-GUTI, if available;\niii)\ta native 5G-GUTI assigned by any other SNPN along with the NID of the SNPN that assigned the 5G-GUTI, if available; or\niv)\tOtherwise, the UE shall include its SUCI in the Registration Request as defined in TS 33.501 [15].\nWhen the UE performing an Initial Registration has both a valid EPS GUTI and a native 5G-GUTI, the UE shall also indicate the native 5G-GUTI as Additional GUTI. If more than one native 5G-GUTIs are available, the UE shall select the 5G-GUTI in decreasing order of preference among items (ii)-(iv) in the list above.\nThe NAS message container shall be included if the UE is sending a Registration Request message as an Initial NAS message and the UE has a valid 5G NAS security context and the UE needs to send non-cleartext IEs, see clause 4.4.6 of TS 24.501 [25]. If the UE does not need to send non-cleartext IEs, the UE shall send a Registration Request message without including the NAS message container.\nIf the UE does not have a valid 5G NAS security context, the UE shall send the Registration Request message without including the NAS message container. The UE shall include the entire Registration Request message (i.e. containing cleartext IEs and non-cleartext IEs) in the NAS message container that is sent as part of the Security Mode Complete message in step 9b.\nWhen the UE is performing an Initial Registration (i.e. the UE is in RM-DEREGISTERED state) with a native 5G-GUTI then the UE shall indicate the related GUAMI information in the AN parameters. When the UE is performing an Initial Registration with its SUCI, the UE shall not indicate any GUAMI information in the AN parameters.\nWhen the UE is performing an Initial Registration or a Mobility Registration and if CIoT 5GS Optimisations are supported the UE shall indicate its Preferred Network Behaviour (see clause 5.31.2 of TS 23.501 [2]). If S1 mode is supported the UE's EPC Preferred Network Behaviour is included in the S1 UE network capabilities in the Registration Request message, see clause 8.2.6.1 of TS 24.501 [25].\nFor an Emergency Registration, the SUCI shall be included if the UE does not have a valid 5G-GUTI available; the PEI shall be included when the UE has no SUPI and no valid 5G-GUTI. In other cases, the 5G-GUTI is included and it indicates the last serving AMF.\nThe UE may provide the UE's usage setting based on its configuration as defined in clause 5.16.3.7 of TS 23.501 [2]. The UE provides Requested NSSAI (as described in clause 5.15.5.2.1 of TS 23.501 [2] and if the UE supports the subscription-based restrictions to simultaneous registration of network slices, also taking into account the NSSRG Information constraints as described in clause 5.15.12 of TS 23.501 [2] and in the case of Initial Registration or Mobility Registration Update, the UE includes the Mapping Of Requested NSSAI (if available), which is the mapping of each S-NSSAI of the Requested NSSAI to the HPLMN S-NSSAIs, to ensure that the network is able to verify whether the S-NSSAI(s) in the Requested NSSAI are permitted based on the Subscribed S-NSSAIs. If the Network Slice Replacement is used and the UE is configured with Mapping Of Alternative NSSAI, the Requested NSSAI may include Alternative S-NSSAI(s). If the AMF determines that S-NSSAI(s) that the UE requests are not Alternative S-NSSAI(s) in the UE context and not Subscribed S-NSSAIs, the AMF determines to update the UE configuration as described in clause 5.15.19 of TS 23.501 [2]. In the case of inter PLMN mobility, if the serving PLMN S-NSSAI(s) corresponding to the established PDU Session(s) are not present in the UE, the associated HPLMN S-NSSAI(s) associated with the established PDU Session(s) shall be provided in the Mapping Of Requested NSSAI as described in clause 5.15.5.2.1 TS 23.501 [2]. If the UEs supports reconnection to the network due to RAN timing synchronization status change as described in TS 23.501 [2], the UE indicates the support of this capability to the network. If the UE supports UE configuration of network-controlled Slice Usage Policy and the UE stores Slice Usage Policy, the UE shall include an on demand S-NSSAI in the Requested NSSAI only when applications in the UE require data transmission by a PDU session associated with the on demand S-NSSAI as described in clause 5.15.15 of TS 23.501 [2].\nThe UE includes the Default Configured NSSAI Indication if the UE is using a Default Configured NSSAI, as defined in TS 23.501 [2].\nThe UE may include UE paging probability information if it supports the assignment of WUS Assistance Information or AMF PEIPS Assistance Information from the AMF (see TS 23.501 [2]).\nThe UE may include Paging Subgrouping Support Indication as defined in TS 23.501 [2].\nIn the case of Mobility Registration Update, the UE includes in the List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated the PDU Sessions for which there are pending uplink data. When the UE includes the List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated, the UE shall indicate PDU Sessions only associated with the access the Registration Request is related to. As defined in TS 24.501 [25] the UE shall include always-on PDU Sessions which are accepted by the network in the List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated even if there are no pending uplink data for those PDU Sessions.\nNOTE 3:\tA PDU Session corresponding to a LADN is not included in the List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated when the UE is outside the area of availability of the LADN.\nThe UE MM Core Network Capability is provided by the UE and handled by AMF as defined in clause 5.4.4a of TS 23.501 [2]. The UE includes in the UE MM Core Network Capability an indication if it supports Request Type flag \"handover\" for PDN connectivity request during the attach procedure as defined in clause 5.17.2.3.1 of TS 23.501 [2]. If the UE supports 'Strictly Periodic Registration Timer Indication', the UE indicates its capability of 'Strictly Periodic Registration Timer Indication' in the MICO Indication. If the UE supports CAG, the UE indicates its capability of \"CAG supported\" in the UE MM Core Network Capability. If the UE operating two or more USIMs, supports and intends to use one or more Multi-USIM feature(s), the UE indicates one or more Multi-USIM specific features described in clause 5.38 of TS 23.501 [2] in the UE MM Core Network Capability. If the UE supports equivalent SNPNs, the UE indicates its capability of \"equivalent SNPNs\" in the UE MM Core Network Capability. If the UE supports Unavailability Period, the UE indicates its capability of \"Unavailability Period Support\" in the UE MM Core Network Capability. If the UE supports LADN per DNN and S-NSSAI, the UE indicates its support of LADN per DNN and S-NSSAI in the UE MM Core Network Capability. If the UE supports the Network Slice Replacement feature, the UE indicates support for Network Slice Replacement feature as described in clause 5.15.19 of TS 23.501 [2]. If the UE supports UE configuration of network-controlled Slice Usage Policy, the UE indicates its capability of \"UE Configuration of network-controlled Slice Usage Policy\" in the UE MM Core Network Capability as described in clause 5.15.15 of TS 23.501 [2].\nThe UE may provide either the LADN DNN(s) or an Indication Of Requesting LADN Information as described in clause 5.6.5 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf available, the last visited TAI shall be included in order to help the AMF produce Registration Area for the UE.\nNOTE 4:\tWith NR satellite access, the last visited TAI is determined as specified in clause 5.4.11.6 of TS 23.501 [2].\nThe Security parameters are used for Authentication and integrity protection, see TS 33.501 [15]. Requested NSSAI indicates the Network Slice Selection Assistance Information (as defined in clause 5.15 of TS 23.501 [2]). The PDU Session status indicates the previously established PDU Sessions in the UE. When the UE is connected to the two AMFs belonging to different PLMN via 3GPP access and non-3GPP access then the PDU Session status indicates the established PDU Session of the current PLMN in the UE.\nThe Follow-on request is included when the UE has pending uplink signalling and the UE doesn't include List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated, or the Registration type indicates the UE wants to perform an Emergency Registration. In Initial Registration and Mobility Registration Update, UE provides the UE Requested DRX parameters, as defined in clause 5.4.5 of TS 23.501 [2]. The UE may provide the extended idle mode DRX parameters as defined in clause 5.31.7.2 of TS 23.501 [2] to request extended idle mode DRX.\nThe UE provides UE Radio Capability Update indication as described in TS 23.501 [2].\nThe UE includes the MICO Indication and optionally a Requested Active Time value and Requested Periodic Update time value if the UE wants to use MICO Mode with Active Time.\nFor a UE using NR satellite access that provides discontinuous coverage or an event is triggered in the UE that would make the UE unavailable for a certain period of time, the UE may include an Unavailability Type, an Unavailability Period Duration and/or Start of Unavailability Period as described in clause 5.4.13.1 of TS 23.501 [2].\nThe UE may indicate its Service Gap Control Capability in the UE MM Core Network Capability, see clause 5.31.16 of TS 23.501 [2].\nFor a UE with a running Service Gap timer in the UE, the UE shall not set Follow-on Request indication or Uplink data status in the Registration Request message (see clause 5.31.16 of TS 23.501 [2]), except for network access for regulatory prioritized services like Emergency services or exception reporting.\nIf UE supports RACS and has been assigned UE Radio Capability ID(s), the UE shall indicate a UE Radio Capability ID as defined in clause 5.4.4.1a of TS 23.501 [2] as non-cleartext IE.\nThe PEI may be retrieved in initial registration from the UE as described in clause 4.2.2.2.1.\nIf a UE supports the subscription-based restrictions to simultaneous registration of network slices feature, it includes the NSSRG handling support indication in the UE 5GMM Core Network Capability according to clause 5.15.12 of TS 23.501 [2]. The AMF stores whether the UE supports this feature in the UE context.\nIf a UE supports the temporary available network slices feature, it includes the indication of support for temporary available network slices in the UE 5GMM Network Capability according to clause 5.15.16 of TS 23.501 [2].\nWhen a Multi-USIM UE wants to enter CM-IDLE state immediately e.g. after having performed mobility or periodic registration, it includes the Release Request indication and optionally provides Paging Restriction Information.\nWhen the UE is performing a Disaster Roaming Registration, the UE may indicate the PLMN with Disaster Condition for the cases as defined in TS 24.501 [25].\n2.\tIf a 5G-S-TMSI or GUAMI is not included or the 5G-S-TMSI or GUAMI does not indicate a valid AMF the (R)AN, based on (R)AT and Requested NSSAI, if available, selects an AMF\nThe (R)AN selects an AMF as described in clause 6.3.5 of TS 23.501 [2]. If UE is in CM-CONNECTED state, the (R)AN can forward the Registration Request message to the AMF based on the N2 connection of the UE.\nIf the (R)AN cannot select an appropriate AMF, it forwards the Registration Request to an AMF which has been configured, in (R)AN, to perform AMF selection.\n3.\t(R)AN to new AMF: N2 message (N2 parameters, Registration Request (as described in step 1) and [LTE-M Indication].\nWhen NG-RAN is used, the N2 parameters include the Selected PLMN ID (or PLMN ID and NID, see clause 5.30 of TS 23.501 [2]), Location Information and Cell Identity related to the cell in which the UE is camping, UE Context Request which indicates that a UE context including security information needs to be setup at the NG-RAN.\nWhen NG-RAN is used, the N2 parameters shall also include the Establishment cause and IAB-Indication or MBSR Indication if the indication is received in AN parameters in step 1.\nMapping Of Requested NSSAI is provided only if available.\nIf the Registration type indicated by the UE is Periodic Registration Update, then steps 4 to 19 may be omitted.\nWhen the Establishment cause is associated with priority services (e.g. MPS, MCS), the AMF includes a Message Priority header to indicate priority information. Other NFs relay the priority information by including the Message Priority header in service-based interfaces, as specified in TS 29.500 [17].\nThe RAT Type the UE is using is determined (see clause 4.2.2.2.1) and based on it the AMF determines whether the UE is performing Inter-RAT mobility to or from NB-IoT. If the AMF receives the LTE M indication, then it considers that the RAT Type is LTE-M and stores the LTE-M Indication in UE Context.\nIf a UE includes a Preferred Network Behaviour, this defines the Network Behaviour the UE supports and is expecting to be available in the network as defined in clause 5.31.2 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf the UE has included the Preferred Network Behaviour and what the UE indicated it supports in Preferred Network Behaviour is incompatible with the network support, the AMF shall reject the Registration Request with an appropriate cause value (e.g. one that avoids retries on this PLMN).\nIf there is a Service Gap timer running in the UE Context in AMF for the UE and Follow-on Request indication or Uplink data status is included in the Registration Request message, the AMF shall ignore the Follow-on Request indication and Uplink data status and not perform any of the actions related to the status.\nIf the UE has included a UE Radio Capability ID in step 1 and the AMF supports RACS, the AMF stores the Radio Capability ID in UE context.\nFor NR satellite access, the AMF may verify the UE location and determine whether the PLMN is allowed to operate at the UE location, as described in clause 5.4.11.4 of TS 23.501 [2]. If the UE receives a Registration Reject message with cause value indicating that the PLMN is not allowed to operate at the present UE location, the UE shall attempt to select a PLMN as specified in TS 23.122 [22].\nFor a Disaster Roaming Registration, based on the ULI (including Cell ID) received from the NG-RAN, the PLMN with Disaster Condition derived from the UE's 5G-GUTI, derived from the UE's SUCI or indicated by the UE and the local configuration, the AMF determines if Disaster Roaming service can be provided. If the current location is not subject to Disaster Roaming service or the Disaster Roaming service is not provided to the PLMN with Disaster Condition derived from the UE's 5G-GUTI, derived from the UE's SUCI or indicated by UE, then the AMF should reject the Registration Request indicating a suitable Cause value.\n4.\t[Conditional] new AMF to old AMF: Namf_Communication_UEContextTransfer (complete Registration Request) or new AMF to UDSF: Nudsf_Unstructured Data Management_Query().\nThe new AMF determines the old AMF using the UE's 5G-GUTI. If the new AMF received an NID in the Registration request, it determines that the 5G-GUTI was assigned by an SNPN and determines the old AMF using the 5G-GUTI and NID of the SNPN.\n(With UDSF Deployment): If the UE's 5G-GUTI was included in the Registration Request and the serving AMF has changed since last Registration procedure, new AMF and old AMF are in the same AMF Set and UDSF is deployed, the new AMF retrieves the stored UE's SUPI and UE context directly from the UDSF using Nudsf_UnstructuredDataManagement_Query service operation or they can share stored UE context via implementation specific means if UDSF is not deployed. This includes also event subscription information by each NF consumer for the given UE. In this case, the new AMF uses integrity protected complete Registration request NAS message to perform and verify integrity protection.\n(Without UDSF Deployment): If the UE's 5G-GUTI was included in the Registration Request and the serving AMF has changed since last Registration procedure, the new AMF may invoke the Namf_Communication_UEContextTransfer service operation on the old AMF including the complete Registration Request NAS message, which may be integrity protected, as well as the Access Type, to request the UE's SUPI and UE Context. See clause 5.2.2.2.2 for details of this service operation. In this case, the old AMF uses either 5G-GUTI and the integrity protected complete Registration request NAS message, or the SUPI and an indication that the UE is validated from the new AMF, to verify integrity protection if the context transfer service operation invocation corresponds to the UE requested. The old AMF also transfers the event subscriptions information by each NF consumer, for the UE, to the new AMF. If the old AMF has not yet reported a non-zero MO Exception Data Counter to the (H-)SMF, the Context Response also includes the MO Exception Data Counter.\nIf the old AMF has PDU Sessions for another access type (different from the Access Type indicated in this step) and if the old AMF determines that there is no possibility for relocating the N2 interface to the new AMF, the old AMF returns UE's SUPI and indicates that the Registration Request has been validated for integrity protection, but does not include the rest of the UE context.\nFor inter PLMN mobility, UE Context information includes HPLMN S-NSSAIs corresponding to the Allowed NSSAI for each Access Type and Partially Allowed NSSAI, without Allowed NSSAI and Partially Allowed NSSAI of old PLMN.\nNOTE 5:\tThe new AMF Sets the indication that the UE is validated according to step 9a, if the new AMF has performed successful UE authentication after previous integrity check failure in the old AMF.\nNOTE 6:\tThe NF consumers do not need to subscribe for the events once again with the new AMF after the UE is successfully registered with the new AMF.\nIf the new AMF has already received UE contexts from the old AMF during handover procedure, then step 4,5 and 10 shall be skipped.\nFor an Emergency Registration, if the UE identifies itself with a 5G-GUTI that is not known to the AMF, steps 4 and 5 are skipped and the AMF immediately requests the SUPI from the UE. If the UE identifies itself with PEI, the SUPI request shall be skipped. Allowing Emergency Registration without a user identity is dependent on local regulations.\n5.\t[Conditional] old AMF to new AMF: Response to Namf_Communication_UEContextTransfer (SUPI, UE Context in AMF (as per Table 5.2.2.2.2-1)) or UDSF to new AMF: Nudsf_Unstructured Data Management_Query(). The old AMF may start an implementation specific (guard) timer for the UE context.\nIf the UDSF was queried in step 4, the UDSF responds to the new AMF for the Nudsf_Unstructured Data Management_Query invocation with the related contexts including established PDU Sessions, the old AMF includes SMF information DNN, S-NSSAI(s) and PDU Session ID, active NGAP UE-TNLA bindings to N3IWF/TNGF/W-AGF, the old AMF includes information about the NGAP UE-TNLA bindings. If the Old AMF was queried in step 4, Old AMF responds to the new AMF for the Namf_Communication_UEContextTransfer invocation by including the UE's SUPI and UE Context.\nIf old AMF holds information about established PDU Session(s) and it is not an Initial Registration, the old AMF includes SMF information, DNN(s), S-NSSAI(s) and PDU Session ID(s).\nIf old AMF holds UE context established via N3IWF, W-AGF or TNGF, the old AMF includes the CM state via N3IWF, W-AGF or TNGF. If the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state via N3IWF, W-AGF or TNGF, the old AMF includes information about the NGAP UE-TNLA bindings.\nIf old AMF fails the integrity check of the Registration Request NAS message, the old AMF shall indicate the integrity check failure. If the new AMF is configured to allow emergency services for unauthenticated UE, the new AMF behaves as follows:\n-\tIf the UE has only an emergency PDU Session, the AMF either skips the authentication and security procedure or accepts that the authentication may fail and continues the Mobility Registration Update procedure; or\n-\tIf the UE has both emergency and non emergency PDU Sessions and authentication fails, the AMF continues the Mobility Registration Update procedure and deactivates all the non-emergency PDU Sessions as specified in clause 4.3.4.2.\nNOTE 7:\tThe new AMF can determine if a PDU Session is used for emergency service by checking whether the DNN matches the emergency DNN.\nIf old AMF holds information about AM Policy Association and the information about UE Policy Association (i.e. the Policy Control Request Trigger for updating UE Policy as defined in TS 23.503 [20]), the old AMF includes the information about the AM Policy Association, the UE Policy Association and PCF ID. In the roaming case, V-PCF ID and H-PCF ID are included.\nIf old AMF was a consumer of UE related NWDAF services, the old AMF includes information about active analytics subscriptions, i.e. the Subscription Correlation ID, NWDAF identifier (i.e. Instance ID or Set ID), Analytics ID(s) and associated Analytics specific data in the Namf_Communication_UEContextTransfer response. Usage of the analytics information by the new AMF is specified in TS 23.288 [50].\nDuring inter PLMN mobility, the handling of the UE Radio Capability ID in the new AMF is as defined in TS 23.501 [2].\nNOTE 8:\tWhen new AMF uses UDSF for context retrieval, interactions between old AMF, new AMF and UDSF due to UE signalling on old AMF at the same time is implementation issue.\n6.\t[Conditional] new AMF to UE: Identity Request ().\nIf the SUCI is not provided by the UE nor retrieved from the old AMF the Identity Request procedure is initiated by AMF sending an Identity Request message to the UE requesting the SUCI.\n7.\t[Conditional] UE to new AMF: Identity Response ().\nThe UE responds with an Identity Response message including the SUCI. The UE derives the SUCI by using the provisioned public key of the HPLMN, as specified in TS 33.501 [15].\n8.\tThe AMF may decide to initiate UE authentication by invoking an AUSF. In that case, the AMF selects an AUSF based on SUPI or SUCI, as described in clause 6.3.4 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf the AMF is configured to support Emergency Registration for unauthenticated SUPIs and the UE indicated Registration type Emergency Registration, the AMF skips the authentication or the AMF accepts that the authentication may fail and continues the Registration procedure.\n9a.\tIf authentication is required, the AMF requests it from the AUSF; if Tracing Requirements about the UE are available at the AMF, the AMF provides Tracing Requirements in its request to AUSF. For a Disaster Roaming Registration, the AMF may provide the indication of Disaster Roaming service in its request to AUSF. Upon request from the AMF, the AUSF shall execute authentication of the UE. The authentication is performed as described in TS 33.501 [15]. The AUSF selects a UDM as described in clause 6.3.8 of TS 23.501 [2] and gets the authentication data from UDM.\nThe AUSF may provide the indication of Disaster Roaming service to UDM if the indication is received from AMF. For a Disaster Roaming Registration, the AUSF executes authentication of the UE based on the local policy and/or local configuration as specified in clause 5.40.4 of TS 23.501 [2] and in TS 33.501 [15].\nOnce the UE has been authenticated the AUSF provides relevant security related information to the AMF. If the AMF provided a SUCI to AUSF, the AUSF shall return the SUPI to AMF only after the authentication is successful.\nAfter successful authentication in new AMF, which is triggered by the integrity check failure in old AMF at step 5, the new AMF invokes step 4 above again and indicates that the UE is validated (i.e. through the reason parameter as specified in clause 5.2.2.2.2).\n9b\tIf NAS security context does not exist, the NAS security initiation is performed as described in TS 33.501 [15]. If the UE had no NAS security context in step 1, the UE includes the full Registration Request message as defined in TS 24.501 [25].\nThe AMF decides if the Registration Request needs to be rerouted as described in clause 4.2.2.2.3, where the initial AMF refers to the AMF.\n9c.\tThe AMF initiates NGAP procedure to provide the 5G-AN with security context as specified in TS 38.413 [10] if the 5G-AN had requested for UE Context. Also, if the AMF decides that EPS fallback is supported (e.g. based on UE capability to support Request Type flag \"handover\" for PDN connectivity request during the attach procedure as defined in clause 5.17.2.3.1 of TS 23.501 [2], subscription data and local policy), the AMF shall send an indication \"Redirection for EPS fallback for voice is possible\" towards 5G-AN as specified in TS 38.413 [10]. Otherwise, the AMF indicates \"Redirection for EPS fallback for voice is not possible\". In addition, if Tracing Requirements about the UE are available at the AMF, the AMF provides the 5G-AN with Tracing Requirements in the NGAP procedure. If QMC Configuration information is available at the AMF, the AMF provides the 5G-AN with QMC Configuration information in the NGAP procedure.\n9d.\tThe 5G-AN stores the security context and acknowledges to the AMF. The 5G-AN uses the security context to protect the messages exchanged with the UE as described in TS 33.501 [15].\n10.\t[Conditional] new AMF to old AMF: Namf_Communication_RegistrationStatusUpdate (PDU Session ID(s) to be released e.g. due to slice not supported).\nIf the AMF has changed the new AMF informs the old AMF that the registration of the UE in the new AMF is completed by invoking the Namf_Communication_RegistrationStatusUpdate service operation.\nIf the authentication/security procedure fails, then the Registration shall be rejected and the new AMF invokes the Namf_Communication_RegistrationStatusUpdate service operation with a reject indication towards the old AMF. The old AMF continues as if the UE context transfer service operation was never received.\nThe new AMF determines the PDU Session(s) that cannot be supported in the new Registration Area in the cases below:\n-\tIf one or more of the S-NSSAIs used in the old Registration Area cannot be served in the target Registration Area.\n-\tWhen continuity of the PDU Session(s) cannot be supported between networks (e.g. SNPN-SNPN mobility, inter-PLMN mobility where no HR agreement exists).\nIf any of the cases is met, the new AMF invokes the Namf_Communication_RegistrationStatusUpdate service operation including the rejected PDU Session ID towards the old AMF. Then the new AMF modifies the PDU Session Status correspondingly. The old AMF informs the corresponding SMF(s) to locally release the UE's SM context by invoking the Nsmf_PDUSession_ReleaseSMContext service operation.\nIf new AMF received in the UE context transfer in step 5 the information about the AM Policy Association and the UE Policy Association and decides, based on local policies, not to use the PCF(s) identified by the PCF ID(s) for the AM Policy Association and the UE Policy Association, then it will inform the old AMF that the AM Policy Association and the UE Policy Association in the UE context is not used any longer and then the PCF selection is performed in step 15.\nIf the new AMF received in the UE context transfer in step 5 the information about UE related analytics subscription(s), the new AMF may take over the analytics subscription(s) from the old AMF. Otherwise, if the new AMF instead determines to create new analytics subscription(s), it informs the old AMF about the analytics subscriptions (identified by their Subscription Correlation ID) that are not needed any longer and the old AMF may now unsubscribe those NWDAF analytics subscriptions for the UE according to TS 23.288 [50].\n11.\t[Conditional] new AMF to UE: Identity Request/Response (PEI).\nIf the PEI was not provided by the UE nor retrieved from the old AMF the Identity Request procedure is initiated by AMF sending an Identity Request message to the UE to retrieve the PEI. The PEI shall be transferred encrypted unless the UE performs Emergency Registration and cannot be authenticated.\nFor an Emergency Registration, the UE may have included the PEI in the Registration Request. If so, the PEI retrieval is skipped.\nIf the UE supports RACS as indicated in UE MM Core Network Capability, the AMF shall use the PEI of the UE to obtain the IMEI/TAC for the purpose of RACS operation.\n12.\tOptionally the new AMF initiates ME identity check by invoking the N5g-eir_EquipmentIdentityCheck_Get service operation (see clause 5.2.4.2.2).\nThe PEI check is performed as described in clause 4.7.\nFor an Emergency Registration, if the PEI is blocked, operator policies determine whether the Emergency Registration procedure continues or is stopped.\n13.\tIf step 14 is to be performed, the new AMF, based on the SUPI, selects a UDM, then UDM may select a UDR instance. See clause 6.3.9 of TS 23.501 [2].\nThe AMF selects a UDM as described in clause 6.3.8 of TS 23.501 [2].\n14a-c.\tIf the AMF has changed since the last Registration procedure, if UE Registration type is Initial Registration or Emergency Registration, or if the UE provides a SUPI which does not refer to a valid context in the AMF, or if the UE registers to the same AMF it has already registered to a non-3GPP access (i.e. the UE is registered over a non-3GPP access and initiates this Registration procedure to add a 3GPP access), the new AMF registers with the UDM using Nudm_UECM_Registration for the access to be registered (and subscribes to be notified when the UDM deregisters this AMF). The UDM based on the \"Registration Type\" in the Nudm_UECM_Registration request, can act on SoR information according to TS 23.122 [22]. In this case, if the AMF does not have event exposure subscription information for this UE, the AMF indicates it to UDM. Then, if the UDM has existing applicable event exposure subscriptions for events detected in AMF for this UE or for any of the groups this UE belongs to (possibly retrieved from UDR), UDM invokes the Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe service for recreating the event exposure subscriptions.\nThe AMF provides the \"Homogenous Support of IMS Voice over PS Sessions\" indication (see clause 5.16.3.3 of TS 23.501 [2]) to the UDM. The \"Homogenous Support of IMS Voice over PS Sessions\" indication shall not be included unless the AMF has completed its evaluation of the support of \"IMS Voice over PS Session\" as specified in clause 5.16.3.2 of TS 23.501 [2].\nDuring initial Registration, if the AMF and UE supports SRVCC from NG-RAN to UTRAN the AMF provides UDM with the UE SRVCC capability.\nIf the AMF determines that only the UE SRVCC capability has changed, the AMF sends UE SRVCC capability to the UDM.\nNOTE 9:\tAt this step, it is possible that the AMF does not have all the information needed to determine the setting of the IMS Voice over PS Session Supported indication for this UE (see clause 5.16.3.2 of TS 23.501 [2]). Hence the AMF can send the \"Homogenous Support of IMS Voice over PS Sessions\" later on in this procedure.\nAfter AMF has successfully completed the Nudm_UECM_Registration operation and if the AMF does not have subscription data for the UE, the AMF retrieves the Access and Mobility Subscription data, SMF Selection Subscription data, UE context in SMF data and LCS mobile origination using Nudm_SDM_Get. If the AMF already has subscription data for the UE but the SoR Update Indicator in the UE context requires the AMF to retrieve SoR information depending on the NAS Registration Type (\"Initial Registration\" or \"Emergency Registration\") (see Annex C of TS 23.122 [22]), the AMF retrieves the Steering of Roaming information using Nudm_SDM_Get. This requires that UDM may retrieve this information from UDR by Nudr_DM_Query. After a successful response is received, the AMF subscribes to be notified using Nudm_SDM_Subscribe when the data requested is modified, UDM may subscribe to UDR by Nudr_DM_Subscribe. The GPSI is provided to the AMF in the Access and Mobility Subscription data from the UDM if the GPSI is available in the UE subscription data. The UDM may provide indication that the subscription data for network slicing is updated for the UE. If the UE is subscribed to MPS in the serving PLMN, \"MPS priority\" is included in the Access and Mobility Subscription data provided to the AMF. If the UE is subscribed to MCX in the serving PLMN, \"MCX priority\" is included in the Access and Mobility Subscription data provided to the AMF. The UDM also provides the IAB-Operation allowed indication or MBSR Operation allowed indication to AMF as part of the Access and Mobility Subscription data. The AMF shall trigger the setup of the UE context in NG-RAN, or modification of the UE context in NG-RAN if the initial setup is at step 9c, including an indication that the IAB-node is authorized or MBSR is authorized. If a S-NSSAI in the Subscribed S-NSSAIs is subject to network slice usage control and the S-NSSAI is dedicated to a single AF, the UDM may provide a Slice Usage Policy information including whether a network slice is on demand and a slice deregistration inactivity timer value for the Subscribed S-NSSAIs as described in clause 5.15.15 of TS 23.501 [2].\nThe UDM may provide the NCR-Operation allowed indication to AMF as part of the Access and Mobility Subscription data. The AMF shall trigger the setup of the UE context in NG-RAN, or modification of the UE context in NG-RAN if the initial setup is at step 9c, including an indication of NCR-MT authorization information.\nFor a Disaster Roaming Registration, the AMF may provide the indication of Disaster Roaming service to the UDM. The UDM provides the subscription data for a Disaster Roaming service to the AMF based on the local policy and/or the local configuration as specified in clause 5.40.4 of TS 23.501 [2].\nThe AMF provides MINT support indication via Nudm_UECM_Registration towards UDM, if UE includes the MINT support indication in the 5GMM capability as specified in clause 5.40.2 of TS 23.501 [2] or if the MINT support indication in the 5GMM capability is changed.\nIf the AMF receives a priority indication (e.g. MPS, MCX) as part of the Access and Mobility Subscription data, but the UE did not provide an Establishment cause associated with priority services, the AMF shall include a Message Priority header to indicate priority information for all subsequent messages. Other NFs relay the priority information by including the Message Priority header in service-based interfaces, as specified in TS 29.500 [17].\nThe new AMF provides the Access Type it serves for the UE to the UDM and the Access Type is set to \"3GPP access\". The UDM stores the associated Access Type together with the serving AMF and does not remove the AMF identity associated to the other Access Type if any. The UDM may store in UDR information provided at the AMF registration by Nudr_DM_Update.\nIf the UE was registered in the old AMF for an access and the old and the new AMFs are in the same PLMN, the new AMF sends a separate/independent Nudm_UECM_Registration to update UDM with Access Type set to access used in the old AMF, after the old AMF relocation is successfully completed.\nThe new AMF creates an UE context for the UE after getting the Access and Mobility Subscription data from the UDM. The Access and Mobility Subscription data includes whether the UE is allowed to include NSSAI in the 3GPP access RRC Connection Establishment in clear text. The Access and Mobility Subscription data may include Enhanced Coverage Restricted information. If received from the UDM and the UE included support for restriction of use of Enhanced Coverage in step 1, the AMF determines whether Enhanced Coverage is restricted or not for the UE as specified in clause 5.31.12 of TS 23.501 [2] and stores the updated Enhanced Coverage Restricted information in the UE context.\nThe Access and Mobility Subscription data may include the NB-IoT UE Priority. For subscribed S-NSSAIs subject to NSAC, the AMF stores the corresponding applicable NSAC admission mode.\nThe subscription data may contain Service Gap Time parameter. If received from the UDM, the AMF stores this Service Gap Time in the UE Context in AMF for the UE.\nIf the AMF has the LADN service area and UE indication of support for LADN per DNN and S-NSSAI, the AMF applies LADN per DNN and S-NSSAI as described in 5.20b.2 of TS 23.501 [2].\nFor an Emergency Registration in which the UE was not successfully authenticated, the AMF shall not register with the UDM.\nThe AMF enforces the Mobility Restrictions as specified in clause 5.3.4.1.1 of TS 23.501 [2]. For an Emergency Registration, the AMF shall not check for Mobility Restrictions, access restrictions, regional restrictions or subscription restrictions. For an Emergency Registration, the AMF shall ignore any unsuccessful registration response from UDM and continue with the Registration procedure.\nNOTE 10:\tThe AMF can, instead of the Nudm_SDM_Get service operation, use the Nudm_SDM_Subscribe service operation with an Immediate Report Indication that triggers the UDM to immediately return the subscribed data if the corresponding feature is supported by both the AMF and the UDM.\n14d.\tWhen the UDM stores the associated Access Type (e.g. 3GPP) together with the serving AMF as indicated in step 14a, it will cause the UDM to initiate a Nudm_UECM_DeregistrationNotification (see clause 5.2.3.2.2) to the old AMF corresponding to the same (e.g. 3GPP) access, if one exists. If the timer started in step 5 is not running, the old AMF may remove the UE context for the same Access Type. Otherwise, the AMF may remove UE context for the same Access Type when the timer expires. If the serving NF removal reason indicated by the UDM is Initial Registration, then, as described in clause 4.2.2.3.2, the old AMF invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_ReleaseSMContext (SM Context ID) service operation towards all the associated SMF(s) of the UE to notify that the UE is deregistered from old AMF for the same Access Type. The SMF(s) shall release the PDU Session on getting this notification.\nIf the old AMF has established an AM Policy Association and a UE Policy Association with the PCF(s) and the old AMF did not transfer the PCF ID(s) to the new AMF (e.g. new AMF is in different PLMN), the old AMF performs an AMF-initiated Policy Association Termination procedure, as defined in clause 4.16.3.2 and performs an AMF-initiated UE Policy Association Termination procedure, as defined in clause 4.16.13.1. In addition, if the old AMF transferred the PCF ID(s) in the UE context but the new AMF informed in step 10 that the AM Policy Association information and UE Policy Association information in the UE context will not be used then the old AMF performs an AMF-initiated Policy Association Termination procedure, as defined in clause 4.16.3.2 and performs an AMF-initiated UE Policy Association Termination procedure, as defined in clause 4.16.13.1.\nIf the old AMF has an N2 connection for that UE (e.g. because the UE was in RRC_INACTIVE state but has now moved to E-UTRAN or moved to an area not served by the old AMF), the old AMF shall perform AN Release (see clause 4.2.6) with a cause value that indicates that the UE has already locally released the NG-RAN's RRC Connection.\nIf the UE context in the old AMF contains an Allowed NSSAI or Partially Allowed NSSAI including one or more S-NSSAI(s) subject to NSAC, the old AMF upon receipt of the Nudm_UECM_DeregistrationNotification from the UDM, sends an update request message for each S-NSSAI subject to NSAC to the corresponding NSACF(s) with update flag parameter set to decrease (see clause 4.2.11.2).\nAt the end of registration procedure, the AMF may initiate synchronization of event exposure subscriptions with the UDM if the AMF does not indicate unavailability of event exposure subscription in step 14a.\nNOTE 11:\tThe AMF can initiate synchronization with UDM even if events are available in the UE context (e.g. as received from old AMF) at any given time and based on local policy. This can be done during subscription change related event.\n14e.\t[Conditional] If old AMF does not have UE context for another access type (i.e. non-3GPP access), the Old AMF unsubscribes with the UDM for subscription data using Nudm_SDM_unsubscribe.\n15.\tIf the AMF decides to initiate PCF communication, the AMF acts as follows.\nIf the new AMF decides to use the (V-)PCF identified by the (V-)PCF ID included in UE context from the old AMF in step 5, the AMF contacts the (V-)PCF identified by the (V-)PCF ID to obtain policy. If the AMF decides to perform PCF discovery and selection and the AMF selects a (V)-PCF and may select an H-PCF (for roaming scenario) as described in clause 6.3.7.1 of TS 23.501 [2] and according to the V-NRF to H-NRF interaction described in clause 4.3.2.2.3.3.\n16.\t[Optional] new AMF performs an AM Policy Association Establishment/Modification. For an Emergency Registration, this step is skipped.\nIf the new AMF selects a new (V-)PCF in step 15, the new AMF performs AM Policy Association Establishment with the selected (V-)PCF as defined in clause 4.16.1.2.\nIf the (V-)PCF identified by the (V-)PCF ID included in UE context from the old AMF is used, the new AMF performs AM Policy Association Modification with the (V-)PCF as defined in clause 4.16.2.1.2.\nIf the AMF notifies the Mobility Restrictions (e.g. UE location) to the PCF for adjustment, or if the PCF updates the Mobility Restrictions itself due to some conditions (e.g. application in use, time and date), the PCF shall provide the updated Mobility Restrictions to the AMF. If the subscription information includes Tracing Requirements, the AMF provides the PCF with Tracing Requirements.\nIf the AMF supports DNN replacement, the AMF provides the PCF with the Allowed NSSAI and Partially Allowed NSSAI and if available, the Mapping Of Allowed NSSAI and Mapping Of Partially Allowed NSSAI.\nIf the PCF supports DNN replacement, the PCF provides the AMF with triggers for DNN replacement.\nIf the PCF supports the slice replacement, the PCF provides the AMF with triggers for slice replacement.\nIf a S-NSSAI in subject to network slice usage control, the PCF may provide a Slice Usage Policy information including, whether a network slice is on demand and a slice deregistration inactivity timer value, for the Subscribed S-NSSAIs as described in clause 5.15.15 of TS 23.501 [2].\n17.\t[Conditional] AMF to SMF: Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext () or Nsmf_PDUSession_ReleaseSMContext ().\nFor an Emergency Registered UE (see TS 23.501 [2]), this step is applied when the Registration Type is Mobility Registration Update.\nThe AMF invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext (see clause 5.2.8.2.6) in the following scenario(s):\n-\tIf the List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated is included in the Registration Request in step 1, the AMF sends Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request to SMF(s) associated with the PDU Session(s) in order to activate User Plane connections of these PDU Session(s). Steps from step 5 onwards described in clause 4.2.3.2 are executed to complete the User Plane connection activation without sending the RRC Inactive Assistance Information and without sending MM NAS Service Accept from the AMF to (R)AN described in step 12 of clause 4.2.3.2. When a User Plane connection for a PDU Session is activated, the AS layer in the UE indicates it to the NAS layer.\n-\tIf the AMF has determined in step 3 that the UE is performing Inter-RAT mobility to or from NB-IoT, the AMF sends Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request to SMF(s) associated with the UEs PDU Session(s), so the SMF(s) can update them according to the \"PDU Session continuity at inter RAT mobility\" subscription data. Steps from step 5 onwards described in clause 4.2.3.2 are executed without sending MM NAS Service Accept from the AMF to (R)AN described in step 12 of clause 4.2.3.2.\nWhen the serving AMF has changed, the new serving AMF notifies the SMF for each PDU Session that it has taken over the responsibility of the signalling path towards the UE: the new serving AMF invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext service operation using SMF information received from the old AMF at step 5. It also indicates whether the PDU Session is to be re-activated.\nNOTE 12:\tIf the UE moves into a different PLMN, the AMF in the serving PLMN can insert or change the V-SMF(s) in the serving PLMN for Home Routed PDU session(s). In addition, a V-SMF is removed in case the UE moves from a VPLMN into the HPLMN. In these cases, the same procedures described in clause 4.23.3 are applied for the V-SMF change as for the I-SMF change (i.e. by replacing the I-SMF with V-SMF). During inter-PLMN change, if the same SMF is used, session continuity can be supported depending on operator policies.\nSteps from step 5 onwards described in clause 4.2.3.2 are executed. In the case that the intermediate UPF insertion, removal, or change is performed for the PDU Session(s) not included in \"PDU Session(s) to be re-activated\", the procedure is performed without N11 and N2 interactions to update the N3 user plane between (R)AN and 5GC.\nThe AMF invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_ReleaseSMContext service operation towards the SMF in the following scenario:\n-\tIf any PDU Session status indicates that it is released at the UE, the AMF invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_ReleaseSMContext service operation towards the SMF in order to release any network resources related to the PDU Session.\n-\tIf the UE has moved into a TA not supporting the S-NSSAI associated with the PDU Session, and the AMF determines to release the PDU Session, and no N2 interaction is needed (i.e. UP connection of the PDU Session is not active), the AMF sets the PDU Session status indicating that the PDU Session is released in the network and the AMF invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_ReleaseSMContext service operation towards the SMF.\nIf the serving AMF is changed, the new AMF shall wait until step 18 is finished with all the SMFs associated with the UE. Otherwise, steps 19 to 22 can continue in parallel to this step.\n18.\t[Conditional] If the new AMF and the old AMF are in the same PLMN, the new AMF sends a UE Context Modification Request to N3IWF/TNGF/W-AGF as specified in TS 29.413 [64].\nIf the AMF has changed and the old AMF has indicated that the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state via N3IWF, W-AGF or TNGF and if the new AMF and the old AMF are in the same PLMN, the new AMF creates an NGAP UE association towards the N3IWF/TNGF/W-AGF to which the UE is connected. This automatically releases the existing NGAP UE association between the old AMF and the N3IWF/TNGF/W-AGF.\n19.\tN3IWF/TNGF/W-AGF sends a UE Context Modification Response to the new AMF.\n19a.\t[Conditional] After the new AMF receives the response message from the N3IWF, W-AGF or TNGF in step 19, the new AMF registers with the UDM using Nudm_UECM_Registration as step 14a, but with the Access Type set to \"non-3GPP access\". The UDM stores the associated Access Type together with the serving AMF and does not remove the AMF identity associated to the other Access Type if any. The UDM may store in UDR information provided at the AMF registration by Nudr_DM_Update.\n19b.\t[Conditional] When the UDM stores the associated Access Type (i.e. non-3GPP) together with the serving AMF as indicated in step 19a, it will cause the UDM to initiate a Nudm_UECM_DeregistrationNotification (see clause 5.2.3.2.2) to the old AMF corresponding to the same (i.e. non-3GPP) access. The old AMF removes the UE context for non-3GPP access.\n19c.\tThe Old AMF unsubscribes with the UDM for subscription data using Nudm_SDM_unsubscribe.\n20a.\tVoid.\n21.\tNew AMF to UE: Registration Accept (5G-GUTI, Registration Area, [Mobility restrictions], [PDU Session status], [Allowed NSSAI], [Mapping Of Allowed NSSAI], [Partially Allowed NSSAI], [Mapping Of Partially Allowed NSSAI], [TAI List for S-NSSAIs in Partially Allowed NSSAI], [Configured NSSAI for the Serving PLMN], [Mapping Of Configured NSSAI], [NSSRG Information], [NSAG Information], [rejected S-NSSAIs], [TAI List for any rejected S-NSSAI Partially in the RA], [Pending NSSAI], [Mapping Of Pending NSSAI], [Periodic Registration Update timer], [Active Time], [Strictly Periodic Registration Timer Indication], [LADN Information], [MICO Indication], [IMS Voice over PS session supported Indication], [Emergency Service Support indicator], [Accepted DRX parameters for E-UTRA and NR], [Accepted DRX parameters for NB-IoT], [extended idle mode DRX parameters], [Paging Time Window], [Network support of Interworking without N26], [Access Stratum Connection Establishment NSSAI Inclusion Mode], [Network Slicing Subscription Change Indication], [Operator-defined access category definitions], [List of equivalent PLMNs], [Enhanced Coverage Restricted information], [Supported Network Behaviour], [Service Gap Time], [PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID], [PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID deletion], [WUS Assistance Information], [AMF PEIPS Assistance Information], [Truncated 5G-S-TMSI Configuration], [Connection Release Supported], [Paging Cause Indication for Voice Service Supported], [Paging Restriction Supported], [Reject Paging Request Supported], [Paging Restriction Information acceptance / rejection], [\"List of PLMN(s) to be used in Disaster Condition\"], [Disaster Roaming wait range information], [Disaster Return wait range information], [Forbidden TAI(s)], [List of equivalent SNPNs], [Registered NID], [Unavailability Period Support], [MBSR authorization information], [Return To Coverage Notification Not Required], [Unavailability Period Duration], [Start of Unavailability Period], [S-NSSAI location availability information], [Mapping Of Alternative NSSAI], [Slice Usage Policy], [Maximum Time Offset]).\nIf the Requested NSSAI does not include S-NSSAIs which map to S-NSSAIs of the HPLMN subject to Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization and the AMF determines that no S-NSSAI can be provided in the Allowed NSSAI for the UE in the current UE's Tracking Area and if no default S-NSSAI(s) not yet involved in the current UE Registration procedure could be further considered, the AMF shall reject the UE Registration and shall include in the rejection message the list of Rejected S-NSSAIs, each of them with the appropriate rejection cause value.\nThe Allowed NSSAI for the Access Type for the UE is included in the N2 message carrying the Registration Accept message. The Allowed NSSAI contains only S-NSSAIs that do not require, based on subscription information, Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization and based on the UE Context in the AMF, those S-NSSAIs for which Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization previously succeeded, regardless of the Access Type. The Mapping Of Pending NSSAI is the mapping of each S-NSSAI of the Pending NSSAI for the Serving PLMN to the HPLMN S-NSSAIs.\nIf the UE has indicated its support for the Partial Network Slice support in a Registration Area (see clause 5.15.17 of TS 23.501 [2]) in the UE MM Core Network Capability in the Registration Request, the AMF may include Partially Allowed NSSAI in the Registration Accept with the related TAI List for S-NSSAIs in Partially allowed NSSAI as per TS 23.501 [2] clause 5.1517 and in the N2 message carrying the Registration Accept message without the TAI List for S-NSSAIs in Partially allowed NSSAI. The Partially Allowed NSSAI contains only S-NSSAIs that do not require, based on subscription information, Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization and based on the UE Context in the AMF, those S-NSSAIs for which Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization previously succeeded, regardless of the Access Type. The Mapping Of Partially Allowed NSSAI is the mapping of each S-NSSAI of the Partially Allowed NSSAI for the Serving PLMN to the HPLMN S-NSSAIs.\nIf the UE has indicated its support for the Partial Network Slice support in a Registration Area (see clause 5.15.17 of TS 23.501 [2]) in the UE MM Core Network Capability in the Registration Request, the AMF may include S-NSSAI(s) rejected partially in the RA in the Registration Accept with the applicable TAI List for rejected S-NSSAI partially in the RA.\nIf the UE has indicated its support of the Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization procedure in the UE MM Core Network Capability in the Registration Request, AMF includes in the Pending NSSAI the S-NSSAIs that map to an S-NSSAI of the HPLMN which in the subscription information has indication that it is subject to Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization, as described in clause 4.6.2.4 of TS 24.501 [25]. In such case, the AMF then shall trigger at step 25 the Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization procedure, specified in clause 4.2.9.2, except, based on Network policies, for those S-NSSAIs for which Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization have already been initiated on another Access Type for the same S-NSSAI(s). The UE shall not attempt re-registration with the S-NSSAIs included in the list of Pending NSSAIs until the Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization procedure has been completed, regardless of the Access Type.\nIf the UE has not indicated its support of the Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization procedure in the UE 5GMM Core Network Capability in the Registration Request and the Requested NSSAI includes S-NSSAIs which map to HPLMN S-NSSAIs subject to Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization, the AMF includes those S-NSSAIs in the Requested NSSAI in the Rejected S-NSSAIs.\nIf no S-NSSAI can be provided in the Allowed NSSAI because:\n-\tall the S-NSSAI(s) in the Requested NSSAI are to be subject to Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization; or\n-\tno Requested NSSAI was provided or none of the S-NSSAIs in the Requested NSSAI matches any of the Subscribed S-NSSAIs and all the S-NSSAI(s) marked as default in the Subscribed S-NSSAIs are to be subject to Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization.\nThe AMF shall provide an empty Allowed NSSAI. Upon receiving an empty Allowed NSSAI and a Pending NSSAI, the UE is registered in the PLMN but shall wait for the completion of the Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization procedure without attempting to use any service provided by the PLMN on any access, except e.g. emergency services (see TS 24.501 [25]), until the UE receives an Allowed NSSAI.\nThe AMF stores the NB-IoT Priority retrieved in Step 14 and associates it to the 5G-S-TMSI allocated to the UE.\nIf the Registration Request message received over 3GPP access does not include any Paging Restriction Information, the AMF shall delete any stored Paging Restriction Information for this UE and stop restricting paging accordingly.\nIf the Registration Request message received over 3GPP access includes the Paging Restriction Information, AMF may accept or reject the Paging Restriction Information requested by the UE based on operator policy. If the AMF rejects the Paging Restriction Information, the AMF removes any stored Paging Restriction Information from the UE context and discards the UE requested Paging Restriction Information. If the AMF accepts the Paging Restriction Information from the UE, the AMF stores the Paging Restriction Information from the UE in the UE context and informs the UE about the acceptance/rejection of the requested Paging Restriction Information in the Registration Accept message.\nIf the Registration Request message received over 3GPP access includes a Release Request indication, then:\n-\tthe AMF updates the UE context with any received Paging Restriction Information, then enforces it in the network triggered Service Request procedure as described in clause 4.2.3.3;\n-\tthe AMF does not establish User Plane resources and triggers the AN release procedure as described in clause 4.2.6 after the completion of Registration procedure.\nThe AMF sends a Registration Accept message to the UE indicating that the Registration Request has been accepted. 5G-GUTI is included if the AMF allocates a new 5G-GUTI. Upon receiving a Registration Request message of type \"Initial Registration\", \"mobility registration update\", \"Disaster Roaming Initial Registration\" or \"Disaster Roaming Mobility Registration Update\" from the UE, the AMF shall include a new 5G-GUTI in the Registration Accept message. Upon receiving a Registration Request message of type \"periodic registration update\" from the UE, the AMF should include a new 5G-GUTI in the Registration Accept message. If the UE is already in RM-REGISTERED state via another access in the same PLMN, the UE shall use the 5G-GUTI received in the Registration Accept for both registrations. If no 5G-GUTI is included in the Registration Accept, then the UE uses the 5G-GUTI assigned for the existing registration also for the new registration. If the AMF allocates a new Registration area, it shall send the Registration area to the UE via Registration Accept message. For a Disaster Roaming Registration, the AMF allocates the Registration Area limited to the area with Disaster Condition as specified in clause 5.40 of TS 23.501 [2]. If there is no Registration area included in the Registration Accept message, the UE shall consider the old Registration Area as valid. Mobility Restrictions is included if mobility restrictions applies for the UE and Registration Type is not Emergency Registration. The AMF indicates the established PDU Sessions to the UE in the PDU Session status. The UE removes locally any internal resources related to PDU Sessions that are not marked as established in the received PDU Session status. If the AMF invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext procedure for UP activation of PDU Session(s) in step 18 and receives rejection from the SMF, then the AMF indicates to the UE the PDU Session ID and the cause why the User Plane resources were not activated. When the UE is connected to the two AMFs belonging to different PLMN via 3GPP access and non-3GPP access then the UE removes locally any internal resources related to the PDU Session of the current PLMN that are not marked as established in received PDU Session status. If the PDU Session status information was in the Registration Request, the AMF shall indicate the PDU Session status to the UE.\nIf the RAT Type is NB-IoT and the network is configured to use the Control Plane Relocation Indication procedure then the AMF shall include in the Registration Accept message the Truncated 5G-S-TMSI Configuration that the UE using Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation uses to create the Truncated 5G-S-TMSI, see clause 5.31.4.3 of TS 23.501 [2].\nThe Allowed NSSAI provided in the Registration Accept is valid in the Registration Area and it applies for all the PLMNs which have their Tracking Areas included in the Registration Area. The Mapping Of Allowed NSSAI is the mapping of each S-NSSAI of the Allowed NSSAI to the HPLMN S-NSSAIs. The Mapping Of Configured NSSAI is the mapping of each S-NSSAI of the Configured NSSAI for the Serving PLMN to the HPLMN S-NSSAIs.\nFor non-roaming UE, if the UE has indicated its support of Slice Usage Policy in the UE 5GMM Core Network Capability, the AMF may include Slice Usage Policies for the slices in the Configured NSSAI as described in clause 5.15.15 of TS 23.501 [2]. In the Slice Usage Policy, the AMF indicates if an S-NSSAI is on demand slice and optionally slice deregistration inactivity timer value. If the AMF includes slice deregistration inactivity timer value, the UE starts any slice deregistration inactivity timer for the on demand S-NSSAIs as described in clause 5.15.15 of TS 23.501 [2]. If the AMF includes updated slice deregistration timer value(s), the UE uses the updated slice deregistration inactivity timer value(s) next time the slice deregistration inactivity timer(s) starts.\nIf the UE has indicated its support of the subscription-based restrictions to simultaneous registration of network slices feature in the UE 5GMM Core Network Capability, the AMF includes, if available, the NSSRG Information, defined in clause 5.15.12 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf the UE has not indicated its support of the subscription-based restrictions to simultaneous registration of network slices feature and the subscription information for the UE includes NSSRG information and the AMF is providing the Configured NSSAI to the UE, the Configured NSSAI shall include the S-NSSAIs according to clause 5.15.12 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf the UE has indicated its support for temporary available network slices feature in the UE 5GMM Core Network Capability, the AMF includes validity time defined in clause 5.15.16 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf the UE has not indicated its support for temporary available network slices feature in the UE 5GMM Core Network Capability and the AMF is providing the Configured NSSAI to the UE, the Configured NSSAI shall not include the S-NSSAIs if the validity time indicates S-NSSAI is not available according to clause 5.15.16 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf the UE has indicated its support of the NSAG feature in the 5GMM Core Network Capability, the AMF includes, if available, the NSAG Information, defined in clause 5.15.14 of TS 23.501 [2].\nThe AMF shall include in the Registration Accept message the LADN Information for the list of LADNs, described in clause 5.6.5 of TS 23.501 [2], that are available within the Registration area determined by the AMF for the UE. If the UE indicates its support of LADN per DNN and S-NSSAI in the UE MM Core Network Capability, the AMF may include LADN Information per DNN and S-NSSAI. The AMF may include Operator-defined access category definitions to let the UE determinine the applicable Operator-specific access category definitions as described in TS 24.501 [25].\nIf the UE included MICO Indication in the Registration Request, then AMF responds in the Registration Accept message whether MICO mode should be used in the MICO Indication. When MICO mode is allowed for the UE, the AMF may include an Active Time value and/or Strictly Periodic Registration Timer Indication in the Registration Accept message. The AMF determines the Periodic Registration Update timer value, Active Time value and the Strictly Periodic Registration Timer Indication based on:\n-\tlocal configuration;\n-\tExpected UE Behaviour if available;\n-\tUE indicated preferences;\n-\tUE capability;\n-\tUE subscription information;\n-\tif using a RAN that provides discontinuous coverage, UE availability (see clause 5.4.13.1 of TS 23.501 [2]); and\n-\tnetwork policies,\nor any combination of them so as to enable UE power saving, as described in clause 5.31.7 of TS 23.501 [2]. The AMF determines to apply the Strictly Periodic Registration Timer Indication to the UE if the UE indicates its capability of the Strictly Periodic Registration Timer Indication in the registration request message, as described in step 1. If the AMF provides the Periodic Registration Update timer value with the Strictly Periodic Registration Timer Indication to the UE, the UE and the AMF start the Periodic Registration Update timer after this step, as described in clause 5.31.7.5 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIn the case of registration over 3GPP access, the AMF Sets the IMS Voice over PS session supported Indication as described in clause 5.16.3.2 of TS 23.501 [2]. In order to set the IMS Voice over PS session supported Indication the AMF may need to perform the UE Capability Match Request procedure in clause 4.2.8a to check the compatibility of the UE and NG-RAN radio capabilities related to IMS Voice over PS. If the AMF hasn't received Voice Support Match Indicator from the NG-RAN on time then, based on implementation, AMF may set IMS Voice over PS session supported Indication and update it at a later stage.\nIn the case of registration over 3GPP access and the AMF has retrieved or determined according to local configuration a Target NSSAI and a corresponding RFSP Index for the purpose of allowing the NG-RAN to redirect the UE to a cell supporting network slices not available in the current TA as described in clause 5.3.4.3.3 of TS 23.501 [2], the AMF provides the Target NSSAI and the corresponding RFSP Index to the NG-RAN.\nIn the case of registration over non-3GPP access, the AMF Sets the IMS Voice over PS session supported Indication as described in clause 5.16.3.2a of TS 23.501 [2].\nThe Emergency Service Support indicator informs the UE that emergency services are supported, i.e. the UE is allowed to request PDU Session for emergency services. If the AMF received \"MPS priority\" from the UDM as part of Access and Mobility Subscription data, based on operator policy, \"MPS priority\" is included in the Registration Accept message to the UE to inform the UE whether configuration of Access Identity 1 is valid within the selected PLMN, as specified in TS 24.501 [25]. If the AMF received \"MCX priority\" from the UDM as part of Access and Mobility Subscription data, based on operator policy and UE subscription to MCX Services, \"MCX priority\" is included in the Registration Accept message to the UE to inform the UE whether configuration of Access Identity 2 is valid within the selected PLMN, as specified in TS 24.501 [25].\nThe Accepted DRX parameters are defined in clause 5.4.5 of TS 23.501 [2]. The AMF includes Accepted DRX parameters for NB-IoT, if the UE included Requested DRX parameters for NB-IoT in the Registration Request message. The AMF Sets the Network support of Interworking without N26 parameter as described in clause 5.17.2.3.1 of TS 23.501 [2]. If the AMF accepts the use of extended idle mode DRX, the AMF includes the extended idle mode DRX parameters and Paging Time Window as described in 5.31.7.2 of TS 23.501 [2]. For a UE using NR satellite access that provides discontinuous coverage, the AMF may determine extended idle mode DRX parameters and Paging Time Window considering the Unavailability Period Duration (if available), Start of Unavailability Period (if available) and the UE requested extended idle mode DRX parameters as described in clause 5.4.13.1 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf the UDM intends to indicate the UE that subscription has changed, the Network Slicing Subscription Change Indication is included. If the AMF includes Network Slicing Subscription Change Indication, then the UE shall locally erase all the network slicing configuration for all PLMNs and if applicable, update the configuration for the current PLMN based on any received information.\nThe Access Stratum Connection Establishment NSSAI Inclusion Mode, as specified in clause 5.15.9 of TS 23.501 [2], is included to instruct the UE on what NSSAI, if any, to include in the Access Stratum connection establishment. The AMF can set the value to modes of operation a,b,c defined in clause 5.15.9 of TS 23.501 [2] in the 3GPP Access only if the Inclusion of NSSAI in RRC Connection Establishment Allowed indicates that it is allowed to do so.\nFor a UE registered in a PLMN, the AMF may provide a List of equivalent PLMNs which is handled as specified in TS 24.501 [25]. The AMF shall not provide a list of equivalent SNPNs to the UE.\nFor a UE registered in an SNPN and the UE has included support of equivalent SNPNs in step 1, the AMF may provide a List of equivalent SNPNs which is handled as specified in TS 24.501 [25]. The AMF shall not provide a list of equivalent PLMNs to the UE.\nIf the UE included support for restriction of use of Enhanced Coverage in step 1, the AMF sends the Enhanced Coverage Restricted information to the NG-RAN in N2 message. The AMF also sends Enhanced Coverage Restricted information to the UE in the Registration Accept message.\nIf the UE receives Enhanced Coverage Restricted information in the Registration Accept message, the UE shall store this information and shall use the value of Enhanced Coverage Restricted information to determine if Enhanced Coverage feature should be used or not.\nIf the UE and the AMF have negotiated to enable MICO mode via MICO Indication and the AMF uses the Extended connected timer, then the AMF provides the Extended Connected time value to NG-RAN (see clause 5.31.7.3 of TS 23.501 [2]) in this step. The Extended Connected Time value indicates the minimum time the RAN should keep the UE in RRC_CONNECTED state regardless of inactivity. For a UE using NR satellite access that provides discontinuous coverage, the AMF may determine the Extended Connected Timer value considering the Unavailability Period Duration (if available), Start of Unavailability Period (if available) as described in clause 5.4.13.1 of TS 23.501 [2].\nThe AMF indicates the CIoT 5GS Optimisations it supports and accepts in the Supported Network Behaviour information (see clause 5.31.2 of TS 23.501 [2]) if the UE included Preferred Network Behaviour in its Registration Request.\nThe AMF may steer the UE from 5GC by rejecting the Registration Request. The AMF should take into account the Preferred and Supported Network Behaviour (see clause 5.31.2 of TS 23.501 [2]) and availability of EPC to the UE before steering the UE from 5GC.\nIf the AMF accepts MICO mode as indicated in Registration Accept via MICO Indication and knows there may be mobile terminated data or signalling pending, the AMF maintains the N2 connection for at least the Extended Connected Time as described in clause 5.31.7.3 of TS 23.501 [2] and provides the Extended Connected Time value to the RAN.\nThe AMF includes Service Gap Time if Service Gap Time is present in the subscription information (steps 14a-c) or the Service Gap Time has been updated by the Subscriber Data Update Notification to AMF procedure (see clause 4.5.1) and the UE has indicated UE Service Gap Control Capability.\nIf the UE receives a Service Gap Time in the Registration Accept message, the UE shall store this parameter and apply Service Gap Control (see clause 5.31.16 of TS 23.501 [2]).\nIf the network supports WUS grouping (see TS 23.501 [2]), the AMF shall send the WUS Assistance Information to the UE. If the UE provided the UE paging probability information in Step 1, the AMF takes it into account to determine the WUS Assistance Information.\nIf the UE provided Paging Subgrouping Support Indication in step 1, a supporting AMF may provide the AMF PEIPS Assistance Information, including the Paging Subgroup ID as defined in TS 23.501 [2].\nWhen the UE and the AMF supports RACS as defined in clause 5.4.4.1a of TS 23.501 [2] and the AMF needs to configure the UE with a UE Radio Capability ID and the AMF already has the UE radio capabilities other than NB-IoT radio capabilities for the UE, the AMF may provide the UE with the UE Radio Capability ID for the UE radio capabilities the UCMF returns to the AMF in a Nucmf_assign service operation for this UE. Alternatively, when the UE and the AMF support RACS, the AMF may provide the UE with an indication to delete any PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID in this PLMN (see clause 5.4.4.1a of TS 23.501 [2]).\nIf the UE is \"CAG supported\" and the AMF needs to update the CAG information of the UE, the AMF may include the CAG information as part of the Mobility Restrictions in the Registration Accept message.\nIf the UE has indicated the support of Unavailability Period in the UE MM Core Network Capability in the Registration Request, the AMF shall indicate to the UE whether the corresponding feature is supported by providing the \"Unavailability Period Support\" indication.\nIf both the UE and the AMF support the Unavailability Period, the AMF may provide an Unavailability Period Duration and/or Start of Unavailability Period determined due to NR satellite access discontinuous coverage during initial registration procedure as described in clause 5.4.1.4 of TS 23.501 [2]. If the UE has provided Unavailability Period Duration and/or Start of Unavailability Period in step 1, the AMF shall store the received Unavailability Period Duration and/or Start of Unavailability Period in UE context. The AMF considers that the UE is unavailable at the start of unavailability period as described in clause 5.4.1.4 of TS 23.501 [2]. The AMF may provide Periodic Registration Update timer based on Unavailability Period Duration and/or Start of Unavailability Period indicated by the UE as described in clause 5.4.1.4 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf the Multi-USIM UE has indicated support for one or more Multi-USIM Specific Capabilities in the UE 5GMM Core Network Capability in step 1, the AMF shall indicate to the Multi-USIM UE whether the corresponding one or more Multi-USIM specific features described in clause 5.38 of TS 23.501 [2] are supported, based on network capability and preference by the network (i.e. based on local network policy), by providing one or more of the Connection Release Supported, Paging Cause Indication for Voice Service Supported, Paging Restriction Supported and Reject Paging Request Supported indications. The AMF shall only indicate Paging Restriction Supported together with either Connection Release Supported or Reject Paging Request Supported. The UE shall only use Multi-USIM specific features that the AMF indicated as being supported.\nIf the NG-RAN provides MBSR indication in step 3 and the subscription data received in step 14 does not allow the MBSR operation, the AMF may either accept the registration with providing the MBSR authorization information to MBSR (IAB-UE), or the AMF may reject the registration if the PLMN does not allow the MBSR (IAB-UE) to be registered to the PLMN as specified in clause 5.35A.4 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf the UE and AMF supports Disaster Roaming service, the AMF may include the \"list of PLMN(s) to be used in Disaster Condition\", Disaster Roaming wait range information and Disaster Return wait range information as specified in TS 23.501 [2].\nIf AMF receives multiple TAIs from the NG-RAN in step 3 and determines that some, but not all of them are forbidden by subscription or by operator policy, the AMF shall include the forbidden TAI(s) in the Registration Accept message.\nIn the case of Emergency Registration, the AMF shall not indicate support for any Multi-USIM specific features to the UE.\nIf the UE has included support of equivalent SNPNs in step 1 and the serving SNPN changes, the AMF shall include the Registered NID in the Registration Accept message as specified in TS 23.501 [2].\nFor a UE using NR satellite access that provides discontinuous coverage, the AMF may provide Return To Coverage Notification Not Required, which requests the UE in CM-IDLE state to not perform the Mobility Registration Update procedure when it returns to coverage and/or provide the UE with a Unavailability Period Duration and/or Start of Unavailability Period (if available), as described in clause 5.4.13.1 of TS 23.501 [2]. The AMF may determine a Maximum Time Offset and provide it to UE when it is allowed to initiate NAS signalling with the network as described in clause 5.4.13.5 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf the UE has indicated the support of S-NSSAI location availability information, the AMF may include S-NSSAI location availability information as described in clause 5.15.18 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf the UE indicated a support for the Network Slice Replacement feature in the 5GMM Core Network Capability and the AMF determines that an S-NSSAI from an Allowed NSSAI is to be replaced with an Alternative S-NSSAI (as described in clause 5.15.19 of TS 23.501 [2]), the AMF includes the Mapping Of Alternative NSSAI within the Registration Accept message to the UE and also adds the Alternative S-NSSAI to the Allowed NSSAI and/or Configured NSSAI, if not already included. The Mapping Of Alternative NSSAI is the mapping of each Alternative S-NSSAI, included in the Allowed NSSAI and/or Configured NSSAI, to the corresponding replaced VPLMN S-NSSAI or HPLMN S-NSSAI (as described in clause 5.15.19 of TS 23.501 [2]).\nIf the UE has indicated a support for reconnection to the network due to RAN timing synchronization status in step 1 as described in TS 23.501 [2], and if the AMF received \"clock quality detail level\" either as part of an AM Policy Association procedure or from the UDM as part of Clock Quality Reporting Control Information (CQRCI) included in the Access and Mobility Subscription data, \"UE reconnection indication\" is included in the Registration Accept message to the UE to inform the UE when to connect to the network in case when the UE later detects that the NG-RAN timing synchronization status has changed while the UE is in RRC IDLE or RRC INACTIVE state, as specified in clause 5.27.1.12 of TS 23.501 [2].\n21b.\t[Optional] The new AMF performs a UE Policy Association Establishment as defined in clause 4.16.11. For an Emergency Registration, this step is skipped.\nThe new AMF sends a Npcf_UEPolicyControl Create Request to PCF. PCF sends a Npcf_UEPolicyControl Create Response to the new AMF.\nPCF triggers UE Configuration Update Procedure as defined in clause 4.2.4.3.\n22.\t[Conditional] UE to new AMF: Registration Complete ().\nThe UE sends a Registration Complete message to the AMF when it has successfully updated itself after receiving any of the [Configured NSSAI for the Serving PLMN], [Mapping Of Configured NSSAI], [NSSRG Information], [NSAG Information] and a Network Slicing Subscription Change Indication, or CAG information in step 21.\nThe UE sends a Registration Complete message to the AMF to acknowledge if a new 5G-GUTI was assigned.\nIf new 5G-GUTI was assigned, then the UE passes the new 5G-GUTI to its 3GPP access' lower layer when a lower layer (either 3GPP access or non-3GPP access) indicates to the UE's RM layer that the Registration Complete message has been successfully transferred across the radio interface.\nNOTE 13:\tThe above is needed because the NG-RAN may use the RRC_INACTIVE state and a part of the 5G-GUTI is used to calculate the Paging Frame (see TS 38.304 [44] and TS 36.304 [43]). It is assumed that the Registration Complete is reliably delivered to the AMF after the 5G-AN has acknowledged its receipt to the UE.\nWhen the List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated is not included in the Registration Request and the Registration procedure was not initiated in CM-CONNECTED state, the AMF releases the signalling connection with UE, according to clause 4.2.6.\nWhen the Follow-on request is included in the Registration Request, the AMF should not release the signalling connection after the completion of the Registration procedure.\nIf the AMF is aware that some signalling is pending in the AMF or between the UE and the 5GC, the AMF should not release the signalling connection immediately after the completion of the Registration procedure.\nIf the UE has provided Unavailability Period Duration and not included Start of Unavailability Period in step 1, the AMF shall release the signalling connection immediately after the completion of the Registration procedure.\nIf the UE has indicated Start of Unavailability Period in step 1, the AMF shall release the signalling connection before the start of unavailability period.\nIf PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID is included in step 21, the AMF stores the PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID in UE context if receiving Registration Complete message.\nIf the AMF provided updated slice deregistration timer value(s) to the UE in step 21, the AMF uses the corresponding slice deregistration inactivity timer value(s) next time the slice deregistration inactivity timer(s) starts.\nIf the UE receives PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID deletion indication in step 21, the UE shall delete the PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID(s) for this PLMN.\n23.\t[Conditional] AMF to UDM: If the Access and Mobility Subscription data provided by UDM to AMF in 14b includes Steering of Roaming information with an indication that the UDM requests an acknowledgement of the reception of this information from the UE, the AMF provides the UE acknowledgement to UDM using Nudm_SDM_Info. For more details regarding the handling of Steering of Roaming information refer to TS 23.122 [22].\n23a.\tFor Registration over 3GPP Access, if the AMF does not release the signalling connection, the AMF sends the RRC Inactive Assistance Information to the NG-RAN.\nFor Registration over non-3GPP Access, if the UE is also in CM-CONNECTED state on 3GPP access, the AMF sends the RRC Inactive Assistance Information to the NG-RAN. If the Multi-USIM UE has indicated support for the Paging Cause Indication for Voice Service feature and the network supports the Paging Cause Indication for Voice Service, the AMF shall include an indication in the RRC Inactive Assistance Information that the UE supports the Paging Cause Indication for Voice Service to NG-RAN to enable NG-RAN to apply the Paging Cause Indication for Voice Service feature for RAN based paging.\nThe AMF also uses the Nudm_SDM_Info service operation to provide an acknowledgment to UDM that the UE received CAG information, or the Network Slicing Subscription Change Indication (see step 21 and step 22) and acted upon it.\n24.\t[Conditional] AMF to UDM: After step 14a and in parallel to any of the preceding steps, the AMF shall send a \"Homogeneous Support of IMS Voice over PS Sessions\" indication to the UDM using Nudm_UECM_Update:\n-\tIf the AMF has evaluated the support of IMS Voice over PS Sessions, see clause 5.16.3.2 of TS 23.501 [2]; and\n-\tIf the AMF determines that it needs to update the Homogeneous Support of IMS Voice over PS Sessions, see clause 5.16.3.3 of TS 23.501 [2].\n25.\t[Conditional] If the UE indicates its support for Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization procedure in the UE MM Core Network Capability in Registration Request and any S-NSSAI of the HPLMN is subject to Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization, the related procedure is executed at this step (see clause 4.2.9.1). Once the Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization procedure is completed for all S-NSSAIs, the AMF shall trigger a UE Configuration Update procedure to deliver an Allowed NSSAI (or Partially Allowed NSSAI) containing also the S-NSSAIs for which the Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization was successful and include any rejected NSSAIs with an appropriate rejection cause value.\nThe AMF stores an indication in the UE context for any S-NSSAI of the HPLMN subject to Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization for which the Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization succeeds.\nOnce completed the Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization procedure, if the AMF determines that no S-NSSAI can be provided in the Allowed NSSAI for the UE, which is already authenticated and authorized successfully by a PLMN and if no default S-NSSAI(s) could be further considered, the AMF shall execute the Network-initiated Deregistration procedure described in clause 4.2.2.3.3 and shall include in the explicit De-Registration Request message the list of Rejected S-NSSAIs, each of them with the appropriate rejection cause value.\nIf Unavailability Period Duration is received from the UE and there is \"Loss of Connectivity\" monitoring event subscription for the UE, the AMF triggers \"Loss of Connectivity\" monitoring event report and includes the remaining values of the Unavailability Period Duration as described in clause 4.15.\nThe mobility related event notifications towards the NF consumers are triggered at the end of this procedure for cases as described in clause 4.15.4.",

      "content": "When an AMF receives a Registration request, the AMF may need to reroute the Registration request to another AMF, e.g. when the initial AMF is not the appropriate AMF to serve the UE. The Registration with AMF re-allocation procedure, described in figure 4.2.2.2.3-1, is used to reroute the NAS message of the UE to the target AMF during a Registration procedure.\nFigure 4.2.2.2.3-1: Registration with AMF re-allocation procedure\nThe initial AMF and the target AMF register their capability at the NRF.\n1.\tIf the UE is in CM-IDLE State, steps 1 and 2 of figure 4.2.2.2.2-1 have occurred and the (R)AN sends the Registration request message within an Initial UE message to the initial AMF. If the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state and triggers registration procedure, the NG-RAN sends Registration request message in the Uplink NAS Transport message to the serving AMF which is initial AMF. The AMF may skip step 2-3.\n2.\tIf the AMF needs the SUPI and/or UE's subscription information to decide whether to reroute the Registration Request or if the Registration Request was not sent integrity protected or integrity protection is indicated as failed, then AMF performs steps 4 to 9a or to 9b of figure 4.2.2.2.2-1.\n3a.\t[Conditional] If the initial AMF needs UE's subscription information to decide whether to reroute the Registration Request and UE's slice selection subscription information was not provided by old AMF, the AMF selects a UDM as described in clause 6.3.8 of TS 23.501 [2].\n3b.\tInitial AMF to UDM: Nudm_SDM_Get (SUPI, Slice Selection Subscription data).\nThe initial AMF request UE's Slice Selection Subscription data from UDM by invoking the Nudm_SDM_Get (see clause 5.2.3.3.1) service operation. UDM may get this information from UDR by Nudr_DM_Query(SUPI, Slice Selection Subscription data).\nFor a Disaster Roaming Registration, the AMF may provide the indication of Disaster Roaming service to the UDM.\n3c.\tUDM to initial AMF: Response to Nudm_SDM_Get. The AMF gets the Slice Selection Subscription data including Subscribed S-NSSAIs.\nUDM responds with slice selection subscription data to initial AMF.\nFor a Disaster Roaming Registration, the UDM responds with the slice selection subscription data for a Disaster Roaming service to initial AMF based on the local policy and/or the local configuration as specified in clause 5.40.4 of TS 23.501 [2].\n4a.\t[Conditional] Initial AMF to NSSF: Nnssf_NSSelection_Get (Requested NSSAI, [Mapping Of Requested NSSAI], Subscribed S-NSSAI(s) with the default S-NSSAI indication, [NSSRG Information], TAI, Allowed NSSAI for the other access type (if any), [Mapping of Allowed NSSAI], PLMN ID of the SUPI).\nIf there is a need for slice selection, (see clause 5.15.5.2.1 of TS 23.501 [2]), e.g. the initial AMF cannot serve all the S-NSSAI(s) from the Requested NSSAI permitted by the subscription information, the initial AMF invokes the Nnssf_NSSelection_Get service operation from the NSSF by including Requested NSSAI, optionally Mapping Of Requested NSSAI, Subscribed S-NSSAIs with the default S-NSSAI indication, [NSSRG Information], Allowed NSSAI for the other access type (if any), Mapping of Allowed NSSAI, PLMN ID of the SUPI and the TAI of the UE. If the AMF needs to indicate the NSSF to return the Configured NSSAI to obtain network slice configuration when it receives from the UDM an indication that subscription has changed for the UE (see step 14b of clause 4.2.2.2.2) to ensure that the information returned by the NSSF includes the new Configured NSSAI for the UE which can be used to update UE network slicing configuration (see step 21 of clause 4.2.2.2.2), the AMF indicates to the NSSF that the AMF needs a Configured NSSAI by providing the Default Configured NSSAI Indication as described in clause 5.15.5.2.1 of TS 23.501 [2].\nThe AMF includes, if available, the NSSRG Information for the S-NSSAIs of the HPLMN, defined in clause 5.15.12 of TS 23.501 [2], including information whether the UE has indicated support of the subscription-based restrictions to simultaneous registration of network slices and whether the UDM has indicated to provide all subscribed S-NSSAIs for non-supporting UEs.\nIf the UE context includes Partially Allowed NSSAI, then the AMF includes the S-NSSAIs of the Partially Allowed NSSAI in the Allowed NSSAI and includes the corresponding HPLMN S-NSSAI in the Mapping Of Allowed NSSAI.\n4b.\t[Conditional] NSSF to Initial AMF: Response to Nnssf_NSSelection_Get (AMF Set or list of AMF addresses, Allowed NSSAI for the first access type, [Mapping Of Allowed NSSAI], [Allowed NSSAI for the second access type], [Mapping of Allowed NSSAI], [NSI ID(s)], [NRF(s)], [List of rejected (S-NSSAI(s), cause value(s))], [Configured NSSAI for the Serving PLMN], [Mapping Of Configured NSSAI]).\nThe NSSF performs the steps specified in point (B) in clause 5.15.5.2.1 of TS 23.501 [2]. The NSSF returns to initial AMF the Allowed NSSAI for the first access type, optionally the Mapping Of Allowed NSSAI, the Allowed NSSAI for the second access type (if any), optionally the Mapping of Allowed NSSAI and the target AMF Set or, based on configuration, the list of candidate AMF(s). The NSSF may return NSI ID(s) associated to the Network Slice instance(s) corresponding to certain S-NSSAI(s). The NSSF may return the NRF(s) to be used to select NFs/services within the selected Network Slice instance(s). It may return also information regarding rejection causes for S-NSSAI(s) not included in the Allowed NSSAI. The NSSF may return Configured NSSAI for the Serving PLMN and possibly the associated mapping of the Configured NSSAI. If the NSSRG information was included in the request, the NSSF provides the Configured NSSAI as described in clause 5.15.12 of TS 23.501 [2].\nNOTE 1:\tThe NRF(s) returned by the NSSF, if any, belong to any level of NRF (see clause 6.2.6 of TS 23.501 [2]) according to the deployment decision of the operator.\n5.\t[Conditional] Initial AMF to old AMF: Namf_Communication_RegistrationStatusUpdate (failure cause ).\nIf the UE was in CM-IDLE and another AMF is selected, the initial AMF sends a reject indication to the old AMF telling that the UE Registration procedure did not fully complete at the initial AMF. The old AMF continues as if the Namf_Communication_UEContextTransfer had never been received.\n6a.\t[Conditional] Initial AMF to NRF: Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request (NF type, AMF Set).\nIf the initial AMF does not locally store the target AMF address and if the initial AMF intends to use direct reroute to target AMF or the reroute via (NG-R)AN message needs to include AMF address, then the initial AMF invokes the Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request service operation from the NRF to find a proper target AMF which has required NF capabilities to serve the UE. The NF type is set to AMF. The AMF Set is included in the Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request.\n6b.\t[Conditional] NRF to AMF: Response to Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request (list of (AMF pointer, AMF address, plus additional selection rules and NF capabilities)).\nThe NRF replies with the list of potential target AMF(s). The NRF may also provide the details of the services offered by the candidate AMF(s) along with the notification end-point for each type of notification service that the selected AMF had registered with the NRF, if available. As an alternative, it provides a list of potential target AMFs and their capabilities and optionally, additional selection rules. Based on the information about registered NFs and required capabilities, a target AMF is selected by the initial AMF.\nIf the security association has been established between the UE and initial AMF, to avoid a registration failure, the initial AMF shall forward the NAS message to the target AMF by executing step 7(A).\nNOTE 2:\tThe security context in the initial AMF is not transferred to the target AMF if initial AMF forward the NAS message to the target AMF via (R)AN. In this case the UE rejects the NAS message sent from target AMF as the security context in the UE and target AMF are not synchronized.\nNOTE 3:\tNetwork slice isolation cannot be completely maintained in case the AMF reallocation is executed by step 7(A).\nIf the initial AMF is not part of the target AMF Set and is not able to get a list of candidate AMF(s) by querying the NRF with the target AMF Set (e.g. the NRF locally pre-configured on AMF does not provide the requested information, the query to the appropriate NRF provided by the NSSF is not successful, or the initial AMF has knowledge that the initial AMF is not authorized as serving AMF etc.) then the initial AMF shall forward the NAS message to the target AMF via (R)AN executing step 7(B) unless the security association has been established between the UE and initial AMF; the Allowed NSSAI, optionally the Partially Allowed NSSAI and the AMF Set are included to enable the (R)AN to select the target AMF as described in clause 6.3.5 of TS 23.501 [2].\n7(A).\tIf the initial AMF, based on local policy and subscription information, decides to forward the NAS message to the target AMF directly, the initial AMF invokes the Namf_Communication_N1MessageNotify to the target AMF, carrying the rerouted NAS message. The Namf_Communication_N1MessageNotify service operation includes AN access information (e.g. the information enabling (R)AN to identify the N2 terminating point, CAG Identifier(s) of the CAG cell) and the complete Registration Request message in clear text as specified in TS 33.501 [15] and the UE's SUPI and MM Context if available. If the initial AMF has obtained the information from the NSSF as described at step 4b, that information except the AMF Set or list of AMF addresses is included. The target AMF then updates the (R)AN with a new updated N2 termination point for the UE in the first message from target AMF to RAN in step 8.\n7(B).\t[Conditional] if the UE was in CM-IDLE, if the initial AMF, based on local policy and subscription information, decides to forward the NAS message to the target AMF via (R)AN unless the target AMF(s) are returned from the NSSF and identified by a list of candidate AMF(s), the initial AMF sends a NGAP Reroute NAS Request message to the (R)AN (step 7a). The NGAP Reroute Request NAS message includes the information about the target AMF and the complete Registration Request message. If the initial AMF has obtained the information as described at step 4b, that information is included. The (R)AN sends the Initial UE message to the target AMF (step 7b) indicating reroute due to slicing including the information from step 4b that the NSSF provided.\nNOTE 4:\tStep 7B is not supported if the UE was in CM-CONNECTED i.e. the NGAP Uplink NAS Transport message was received at step 1.\n8.\tAfter receiving the Registration Request message transmitted at step 7(A)a or step 7(B)b, the target AMF continues with the Registration procedure from step 4 until 22 of figure 4.2.2.2.2-1 (with the target AMF corresponding to the new AMF), which includes the UE context retrieved from old AMF. If the 5G security context is received from the initial AMF, the target AMF continue using that one instead of the 5G security context the target AMF may have retrieved from the old AMF. If the initial AMF decides to forward the NAS message to the target AMF (step 7(A), the first message from the target AMF to (R)AN (either Initial Context Setup Request, or Downlink NAS Transport) contain the AMF name of the initial AMF and target AMF UE NGAP ID.",

The Registration Type \"SNPN Onboarding\" indicates that the UE wants to perform SNPN Onboarding Registration (i.e. allows the UE to access an ON-SNPN for the purpose of provisioning the UE with SO-SNPN credentials). For SNPN Onboarding Registration, a SUCI generated from a SUPI derived from Default UE Credentials shall be included as described in clause 5.30.2.10.2.6 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf the UE has registered in the ON-SNPN for onboarding, the UE can perform a Mobility Registration Update, or a Periodic Registration Update as specified in clause 4.2.2.2.2. If the onboarding registered UE wants to perform a Mobility Registration Update the AN parameters shall also include an Onboarding indication that the UE is registered for onboarding.\nNOTE:\tWhen the UE is performing Registration for Onboarding to an ON-SNPN, the UE does not include a Requested NSSAI as the UE is not pre-configured with a S-NSSAI for the purpose of UE onboarding in the ON-SNPN.\n2.\tBased on the Onboarding indication in step 1, the NG-RAN selects an AMF as described in clause 6.3.5 of TS 23.501 [2].\n3.\tNG-RAN to AMF: The N2 message contains the Registration Request as described in step 1.\n4.\t[Conditional] new AMF to old AMF: Namf_Communication_UEContextTransfer (complete Registration Request).\n5.\t[Conditional] old AMF to new AMF: Response to Namf_Communication_UEContextTransfer (SUPI, UE Context in AMF (as per Table 5.2.2.2.2-1)).

During authentication procedure the AAA Server in the DCS domain may provide PVS FQDN(s) and/or PVS IP address(es) for the UE to the AUSF via the NSSAAF, the AUSF then provides PVS FQDN(s) and/or PVS IP address(es) to the AMF.\nFor DCS hosting AUSF/UDM as shown in step 9-2, the AUSF in DCS domain performs UDM selection. The AMF sends the SUCI and Default UE credentials received from the UE towards the AUSF in DCS domain, which authenticates the UE based on received data from AMF and subscription data from the UDM in DCS domain. During authentication procedure, the AUSF in the DCS domain provides PVS FQDN(s) and/or PVS IP address(es) to the AMF.\nWhen DCS is not involved during primary authentication as shown in step 9-3, the AMF selects a local AUSF as defined in clause 6.3.4 of TS 23.501 [2] and performs primary authentication towards the local AUSF using Default UE credentials as described in TS 33.501 [15].\n10.\t[Conditional] new AMF to old AMF: Namf_Communication_RegistrationStatusUpdate.\n11.\t[Conditional] AMF to UE: Identity Request/Response (PEI).\nIf the PEI was not provided by the UE, the Identity Request procedure is initiated by AMF sending an Identity Request message to the UE to retrieve the PEI.\n12.\tOptionally the new AMF initiates ME identity check by invoking the N5g-eir_EquipmentIdentityCheck_Get service operation (see clause 5.2.4.2.2).\nThe PEI check is performed as described in clause 4.7.\n13-20.\tSkipped.\n21.\tAMF to UE: The AMF sends a Registration Accept message to the UE indicating that the Registration Request for Onboarding SNPN has been accepted.

      "content": "The procedure depicted in Figure 4.2.2.3.3-1 shows Network-initiated Deregistration procedure. The AMF can initiate this procedure for either explicit (e.g. by O&M intervention or if the AMF determines that no S-NSSAI can be provided in the Allowed NSSAI for the UE or the UE's registered PLMN is not allowed to operate in the present UE location or if a disaster condition is no longer being applicable, the AMF initiates Network-initiated Deregistration to trigger the return of UEs to the PLMN that had a Disaster Condition) or implicit (e.g. expiring of Implicit Deregistration timer). The UDM can trigger this procedure for operator-determined purposes (e.g. if a disaster condition is no longer being applicable as specified in clause 5.40.5 of TS 23.501 [2]) to request the removal of a subscriber's RM context and PDU Session(s) of the UE.\nIf the Network-initiated Deregistration procedure is triggered for MBSR IAB-UE that is registered with authorization to act as MBSR, the AMF behaves as described in clause 5.35A.4 of TS 23.501 [2].\nFigure 4.2.2.3.3-1: Network-initiated Deregistration\n1.\t[Conditional] If the UDM wants to request the immediate deletion of a subscriber's RM contexts and PDU Sessions, the UDM shall send a Nudm_UECM_DeregistrationNotification (SUPI, Access Type, Removal Reason) message with Removal Reason set to Subscription Withdrawn to the registered AMF. The Access Type may indicate 3GPP Access, non-3GPP Access or both.\n2.\tIf the AMF receives Nudm_UECM_DeregistrationNotification in Step 1 with Removal Reason as Subscription Withdrawn, the AMF executes Deregistration procedure over the access(es) the Access Type indicates.\nThe AMF-initiated Deregistration procedure is either explicit (e.g. by O&M intervention or if the AMF determines that no S-NSSAI can be provided in the Allowed NSSAI for the UE) or implicit. The AMF does not send the Deregistration Request message to the UE for Implicit Deregistration. If the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state, the AMF may explicitly deregister the UE by sending a Deregistration Request message (Deregistration type, Access Type, [list of Rejected S-NSSAIs, each of them with the appropriate rejection cause value]) to the UE. The Deregistration type may be set to Re-registration in which case the UE should re-register at the end of the Deregistration procedure. Access Type indicates whether Deregistration procedure applies to the 3GPP access or non-3GPP access, or both. If the Deregistration Request message is sent over 3GPP access and the UE is in CM-IDLE state in 3GPP access, the AMF pages the UE. The list of Rejected S-NSSAIs, each of them with the appropriate rejection cause value, is provided if the AMF determines that no S-NSSAI can be provided to the UE in the Allowed NSSAI.\nIf the UE has established PDU Session associated with emergency service, the AMF shall not initiate Deregistration procedure. In this case, the AMF performs network requested PDU Session Release for any PDU session associated with non-emergency service as described in clause 4.3.4.\nFor NR satellite access, the AMF initiates Network-initiated Deregistration if it detects that the UE's registered PLMN is not allowed to operate in the present UE location. In this case, the AMF shall provide the appropriate cause value indicating the PLMN is not allowed to operate in the present UE location, see clause 5.4.11.4 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf the network de-registration is triggered for a UE registered for Disaster Roaming due to a disaster condition no longer being applicable, the Deregistration Request shall contain the cause value \"PLMN not allowed\" and include a disaster return wait range as described in clause 5.5.2.3.1 of TS 24.501 [25] and as specified in clause 5.40.5 of TS 23.501 [2], the network, shall organise the return of the Disaster Roaming UEs in a manner that does not cause overload (e.g. of signalling) in the PLMN that previously had the Disaster Condition.\nIf the MBSR authorization state changes for a MBSR (IAB-UE) registered in network as specified in clause 5.35A.4 of TS 23.501 [2], based on operator configuration, the AMF triggers Deregistration procedure.\n3.\t[Conditional] If the Deregistration procedure is triggered by UDM (Step 1), the AMF acknowledges the Nudm_UECM_DeRegistrationNotification to the UDM.\nIf Access Type indicates 3GPP Access or non-3GPP Access and AMF does not have UE context for another access type, or if Access Type indicates both, the AMF unsubscribes with the UDM using Nudm_SDM_Unsubscribe service operation.\n4.\t[Conditional] If the UE has any established PDU Session over the target access for deregistration indicated in step 2, then step 2 ~ step 5 of UE-initiated Deregistration procedure in clause 4.2.2.3.2 is performed.\n5.\t[Conditional] As in step 6 of Figure 4.2.2.3.2-1.\n5a.\t[Conditional] As in step 6a of Figure 4.2.2.3.2-1.\n6.\t[Conditional] If the UE receives the Deregistration Request message from the AMF in step 2, the UE sends a Deregistration Accept message to the AMF any time after step 2. The NG-RAN forwards this NAS message to the AMF along with the TAI+ Cell identity of the cell which the UE is using.\n7.\t[Conditional] AMF to AN: N2 UE Context Release Request (Cause): as in step 8 of Figure 4.2.2.3.2.\nIf the UE is deregistered over only 3GPP access or non-3GPP access and the AMF does not have UE context for the other, or if the procedure applies to both access types, then at any time, AMF can unsubscribe from the UDM, otherwise the AMF can deregister from UDM using Nudm_UECM_Deregistration request by indicating its associating access type.",

      "content": "The UE in CM-IDLE state initiates the Service Request procedure in order to send uplink signalling messages, user data, to request emergency services fallback, or as a response to a network paging request. The UE shall not initiate UE Triggered Service Request from CM-IDLE if there is a Service Gap timer running. After receiving the Service Request message, the AMF may perform authentication. After the establishment of the signalling connection to an AMF, the UE or network may send signalling messages, e.g. PDU Session establishment from UE to the SMF, via the AMF.\nThe Service Request procedure is used by a UE in CM-CONNECTED to request activation of a User Plane connection for PDU Sessions and to respond to a NAS Notification message from the AMF. When a User Plane connection for a PDU Session is activated, the AS layer in the UE indicates it to the NAS layer.\nThe Service Request procedure is used by the Multi-USIM UE over 3GPP access, in:\na)\tCM-CONNECTED state to request release of the UE connection, stop data transmission, discard of any pending data and optionally, store Paging Restriction Information; or\nb)\tCM-IDLE state to request removal of Paging Restriction Information.\nThe Multi-USIM UE shall not execute UE triggered Service Request procedure with Release Request indication if regulatory prioritized services (e.g. emergency service, emergency callback waiting) are ongoing. After an emergency call, the UE shall not execute a UE triggered Service Request procedure with Release Request indication for a duration which is sufficient for emergency call back.\nc)\tCM-IDLE state to respond to paging with a Reject Paging Indication that indicates that N1 connection shall be released and no user plane connection shall be established. The UE optionally provides the Paging Restriction Information. The UE may be unable to respond to paging with a Reject Paging Indication, e.g. due to UE implementation constraints.\nNOTE 1:\tA Multi-USIM UE in RRC_INACTIVE/CM-CONNECTED state that decides to reject the RAN paging, requests the release of the UE connection as in bullet a) above. The UE can discard, by implementation, any data or NAS PDUs that it receives before it is released.\nFor any Service Request, the AMF responds with a Service Accept message to synchronize PDU Session status between UE and network, if necessary. The AMF responds with a Service Reject message to UE, if the Service Request cannot be accepted by network. The AMF may steer the UE from 5GC by rejecting the Service Request. The AMF should take into account the Preferred and Supported Network Behaviour (see clause 5.31.2 of TS 23.501 [2]) and availability of EPC to the UE before steering the UE from 5GC. The Service Reject message may include an indication or cause code requesting the UE to perform Registration procedure.\nFor this procedure, the impacted SMF and UPF, if any, are all under control of the PLMN serving the UE, e.g. in Home Routed roaming case the SMF and UPF in HPLMN are not involved if V-SMF relocation is not triggered.\nFor Service Request due to user data, network may take further actions if User Plane connection activation is not successful.\nThe procedure in this clause 4.2.3.2 is applicable to the scenarios with or without intermediate UPF and with or without intermediate UPF reselection.\nIf the UE initiates Service Request procedures via non-3GPP Access, functions defined in clause 4.12.4.1 are applied.\nThe User Plane of all PDU Sessions with redundant I-UPFs or with redundant N3/N9 tunnels for URLLC shall be activated during the Service Request procedure if the UE in CM-IDLE state initiates the Service Request procedure from 3GPP access. If the redundant I-UPFs are to be added/replaced/removed, the N4 Session procedure to manage the I-UPF is done for each I-UPF in steps 6c, 6d,7a, 7b, 8a, 8b, 9, 10, 17a,17b, 20a, 20b, 21a,21b, 22a and 22b of the figure 4.2.3.2-1. If the redundant N3/N9 tunnels are used for URLLC and the I-UPF is to be added/replaced/removed, the N4 Session procedure to update the tunnel is done for each N3/N9 tunnel in steps 6c, 6d, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b, 9, 10, 17a, 17b. 20a, 20b, 21a and 21b of the figure 4.2.3.2-1.\nFigure 4.2.3.2-1: UE Triggered Service Request procedure\n1.\tUE to (R)AN: AN message (AN parameters, Service Request (List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated, List Of Allowed PDU Sessions, security parameters, PDU Session status, 5G-S-TMSI, [NAS message container], Exempt Indication, [Release Request indication], [Paging Restriction Information], [Reject Paging Indication])).\nThe NAS message container shall be included if the UE is sending a Service Request message as an Initial NAS message and the UE needs to send non-cleartext IEs, see clause 4.4.6 of TS 24.501 [25].\nThe Multi-USIM UE in CM-CONNECTED state may include the Release Request indication and optionally Paging Restriction Information in the Service Request message over 3GPP access, if the UE intends to leave CM-CONNECTED state.\nThe Multi-USIM UE in CM-IDLE state may include the Release Request indication and not include Paging Restriction Information in the Service Request message over 3GPP access, if the UE intends to delete the Paging Restriction Information.\nIf the Multi-USIM UE in CM-IDLE state decides not to accept the paging, it may send a Service Request message including a Reject Paging Indication and optionally Paging Restriction Information, unless it is not able to send this message e.g. due to UE implementation constraints.\nThe List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated is provided by UE when the UE wants to re-activate the PDU Session(s). The List Of Allowed PDU Sessions is provided by the UE when the Service Request is a response of a Paging or a NAS Notification for a PDU Session associated with non-3GPP access and identifies the PDU Sessions that can be transferred to 3GPP access.\nIn the case of NG-RAN:\n-\tThe AN parameters include 5G-S-TMSI, Selected PLMN ID (or PLMN ID and NID, see clause 5.30 of TS 23.501 [2]), Establishment cause and may also include NSSAI information. The Establishment cause provides the reason for requesting the establishment of an RRC connection. Whether and how the UE includes the NSSAI information as part of the AN parameters is dependent on the value of the Access Stratum Connection Establishment NSSAI Inclusion Mode parameter, as specified in clause 5.15.9 of TS 23.501 [2].\n-\tThe UE sends Service Request message towards the AMF encapsulated in an RRC message to the NG-RAN. The RRC message(s) that can be used to carry the 5G-S-TMSI and this NAS message are described in TS 38.331 [12] and TS 36.331 [16].\nIf the Service Request is triggered by the UE for user data, the UE identifies, using the List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated, the PDU Session(s) for which the UP connections are to be activated in Service Request message. When the UE includes the List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated, the UE shall indicate PDU Sessions only associated with the access the Service Request is related to. If the Service Request is triggered by the UE for signalling only, the UE doesn't identify any List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated. If this procedure is triggered for paging response and the UE has at the same time some user data to be transferred, the UE identifies the PDU Session(s) whose UP connections are to be activated in Service Request message, by the List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated. Otherwise the UE does not identify any PDU Session(s) in the Service Request message for paging response. As defined in TS 24.501 [25] the UE shall include always-on PDU Sessions which are accepted by the network in the List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated even if there are no pending uplink data for those PDU Sessions or when the Service Request is triggered for signalling only or when the Service Request is triggered for paging response.\nIf the Service Request over 3GPP access is triggered in response to the paging or NAS Notification indicating non-3GPP access, the Service Request message shall identify the list of PDU Sessions associated with the non-3GPP access that can be re-activated over 3GPP access in the List Of Allowed PDU Sessions, as described in clause 4.2.3.3 (step 6) of this specification and in clause 5.6.8 of TS 23.501 [2]. When the UE over 3GPP access is in NB-N1 mode and the resulting number of PDU Sessions with user plane resources activated for the UE does not exceed the maximum number of supported user plane resources (0, 1 or 2), based on whether the UE supports UP data transfer and the UE's 5GMM Core Network Capability as described in clause 5.31.19 of TS 23.501 [2], the AMF shall notify the SMF that reactivation of the user-plane resources for the corresponding PDU session(s) associated with non-3GPP access can be performed as defined in TS 24.501 [25].\nIf the Service Request is triggered to report PS Data Off status change and the UE is in Non-Allowed Area, the UE shall send Service Request message with an indication that the message is exempted from restriction (e.g. Non-Allowed Area). In this case, if the UE is in Non-Allowed Area, the UE shall not include the List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated and as a result the always-on PDU Session is not re-activated during the Service Request procedure.\nThe PDU Session status indicates the PDU Sessions available in the UE.\nThe UE shall not trigger a Service Request procedure for a PDU Session corresponding to a LADN when the UE is outside the area of availability of the LADN.\nNOTE 2:\tA PDU Session corresponding to a LADN is not included in the List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated when the UE is outside the area of availability of the LADN.\nFor UE in CM-CONNECTED state, only the List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated and List Of Allowed PDU Sessions need to be included in the Service Request.\nThe UE shall not trigger a Service Request procedure for a PDU Session associated to an S-NSSAI if the S-NSSAI is not valid as per the S-NSSAI location availability information.\nNOTE 3:\tA PDU Session associated to an S-NSSAI is not included in the List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated when the S-NSSAI is not valid as per the S-NSSAI location availability information.\n2.\t(R)AN to AMF: N2 Message (N2 parameters, Service Request).\nDetails of this step are described in TS 38.413 [10]. If the AMF can't handle the Service Request it will reject it.\nWhen NG-RAN is used, the N2 parameters include the 5G-S-TMSI, Selected PLMN ID (or PLMN ID and NID, see clause 5.30 of TS 23.501 [2]), Location information and Establishment cause, UE Context Request.\nIf the UE is in CM-IDLE state, the NG-RAN obtains the 5G-S-TMSI in RRC procedure. NG-RAN selects the AMF according to 5G-S-TMSI. The Location Information relates to the cell in which the UE is camping.\nBased on the PDU Session status, the AMF may initiate PDU Session Release procedure in the network for the PDU Sessions whose PDU Session ID(s) were indicated by the UE as not available.\nWhen the Establishment cause is associated with priority services (e.g. MPS, MCX), or when the AMF determines that the UE has priority subscription (e.g. MPS, MCX) in the UDM, the AMF includes a Message Priority header to indicate priority information. Other NFs relay the priority information by including the Message Priority header in service-based interfaces, as specified in TS 29.500 [17].\nThe AMF enforces the Mobility Restrictions as specified in clause 5.3.4.1.1 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf there is a Service Gap timer running in AMF for the UE and the AMF is not waiting for a MT paging response from the UE and the Service Request is not for regulatory prioritized services like Emergency services or not for exception reporting, the AMF rejects the Service Request with an appropriate cause. In addition, AMF may also provide a UE with a Mobility Management Back-off timer set to the remaining value of the Service Gap timer.\nIf the AMF supports RACS and the AMF detects that the selected PLMN is different from the currently registered PLMN for the UE, the AMF determines the UE Radio Capability ID of the newly selected PLMN to the gNB as described in clause 5.4.4.1a of TS 23.501 [2].\nFor NR satellite access, the AMF may decide to verify the UE location and determine whether the PLMN is allowed to operate at the UE location, as described in clause 5.4.11.4 of TS 23.501 [2]. If the UE receives a Service Reject message with cause value indicating that the PLMN is not allowed to operate in the present UE location, the UE shall attempt to select a PLMN, as specified in TS 23.122 [22].\n3a)\tAMF to (R)AN: N2 Request (security context, Mobility Restriction List, list of recommended cells / TAs / NG-RAN node identifiers).\nIf the 5G-AN had requested for UE Context or there is a requirement for AMF to provide this e.g. the AMF needs to initiate fallback procedure as in clause 4.13.4.2 for Emergency services, AMF initiates NGAP procedure as specified in TS 38.413 [10]. The AMF may provide the indication of NCR-MT authorization information in the UE Context. For UE in CM-IDLE state, 5G-AN stores the Security Context in the UE AN context. Mobility Restriction List is described in clause 5.3.4.1 of TS 23.501 [2].\nThe 5G-AN uses the Security Context to protect the messages exchanged with the UE as described in TS 33.501 [15].\nIf the NG-RAN node had provided the list of recommended cells / TAs / NG-RAN node identifiers during the AN Release procedure (see clause 4.2.6), the AMF shall include it in the N2 Request. The RAN may use this information to allocate the RAN Notification Area when the RAN decides to enable RRC_INACTIVE state for the UE.\n3.\tIf the Service Request was not sent integrity protected or integrity protection verification failed, the AMF shall reject the Service Request as stated in TS 24.501 [25].\nIf the UE in CM-IDLE state triggered the Service Request to establish a signalling connection only, after successful establishment of the signalling connection the UE and the network can exchange NAS signalling and steps 4 to 11 and 15 to 22 are skipped.\nIf the UE in Non-Allowed Area triggered the Service Request with an indication that the message is exempted from restriction (e.g. Non-Allowed Area), the AMF should accept the Service Request. In this case, if the UE is in Non-Allowed Area, the AMF rejects user plane setup request from the SMF except for emergency services.\nIf the procedure was triggered in response to paging or NAS notification indicating non-3GPP access and the AMF received N1 SM Container only from the SMF in step 3a of clause 4.2.3.3, the AMF sends the NAS signalling including the N1 SM Container to the UE in step 7 of clause 4.2.3.3 without updating the access associated to the PDU Session.\nIf the Service Request message is received over 3GPP access without a Release Request indication or a Reject Paging Indication, the AMF shall delete any stored Paging Restriction Information for this UE and stop restricting paging accordingly.\nIf the Service Request message over 3GPP access includes a Release Request indication or a Reject Paging Indication, then:\n-\tthe AMF may accept or reject the received Paging Restriction Information requested by the UE based on operator policy. If the AMF rejects the Paging Restriction Information, the AMF removes any stored Paging Restriction Information from the UE context and discards the UE requested Paging Restriction Information. If the AMF accepts the Paging Restriction Information from the UE, the AMF stores the Paging Restriction Information from the UE in the UE context.\n-\tIf no Paging Restriction Information is provided, no paging restrictions apply and the AMF removes any stored Paging Restriction Information from the UE context.\n-\tno User Plane resources are established and instead the AMF triggers the AN Release procedure as described in clause 4.2.6.\nNOTE 4:\tIf AMF does not perform steps 5-7 before step 2 then some DL data might not be delivered to the UE.\nIf the procedure was triggered in response to paging and the Service Request message includes a Reject Paging Indication, the AMF initiates the UCU procedure as described in step 7 of clause 4.2.3.3 before the triggering of the AN Release procedure.\n4.\t[Conditional] AMF to SMF: Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request (PDU Session ID(s), Operation Type, UE location information, Access Type, RAT Type, UE presence in LADN service area, Indication of Access Type can be changed, [MO Exception Data Counter], [Satellite backhaul category], [GEO Satellite ID]).\nThe Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request is invoked:\n-\tIf the UE identifies List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated in the Service Request message;\n-\tThis procedure is triggered by the SMF but the PDU Session(s) identified by the UE correlates to other PDU Session ID(s) than the one triggering the procedure; or\n-\tIf this procedure is triggered by the SMF in response to paging or NAS notification indicating 3GPP access or if this step onwards is invoked following step 4a of clause 4.2.3.3 and the current UE location is outside the \"Area of validity for the N2 SM information\" provided by the SMF in step 3a of clause 4.2.3.3 or the \"Area of validity for the N2 SM information\" was not provided by the SMF in step 3a of clause 4.2.3.3, the AMF shall not send the N2 information provided by the SMF in step 3a of clause 4.2.3.3. Otherwise, if the current UE location is in the \"Area of validity for the N2 SM information\", steps 4 to 11 are skipped; or\n-\tIf this procedure is triggered by the SMF in response to paging or NAS notification indicating non-3GPP access and the AMF received N2 SM Information only, or both N1 SM Container and N2 SM Information in step 3a of clause 4.2.3.3.\nIf the DNN corresponds to an LADN then the \"UE presence in LADN service area\" indicates if the UE is IN or OUT of the LADN service area. If the AMF does not provide the \"UE presence in LADN service area\" indication and the SMF determines that the DNN corresponds to a LADN, then the SMF considers that the UE is OUT of the LADN service area.\nThe AMF determines the PDU Session(s) for which the UP connection(s) shall be activated and sends an Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request to SMF(s) associated with the PDU Session(s) with Operation Type set to \"UP activate\" to indicate establishment of User Plane resources for the PDU Session(s). The AMF determines Access Type and RAT Type, see clause 4.2.2.2.1. If the RAT type is NB-IoT, the AMF shall ensure that the number of PDU session(s) for which UP connection(s) are active does not exceed this UE's maximum number of supported user plane resources (0, 1 or 2) based on whether the UE supports UP data transfer and the UE 5GMM Core Network Capability as described in clause 5.31.19 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf the procedure was triggered in response to paging or NAS Notification indicating non-3GPP access, the AMF received N2 SM Information in step 3a of clause 4.2.3.3 and the PDU Session for which the UE was paged or notified is not in the List Of Allowed PDU Sessions provided by the UE, the AMF notifies the SMF that the UE is not reachable. For other PDU Sessions in the List Of Allowed PDU Sessions the Service Request Procedure succeeds without re-activating the User Plane of any PDU Sessions, unless they have also been included by the UE in the List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated.\nIf the procedure was triggered in response to paging or NAS notification indicating non-3GPP access and the PDU Session for which the UE was paged or notified is in the List Of Allowed PDU Sessions provided by the UE and the AMF received N2 SM Information only or N1 SM Container and N2 SM Information from the SMF in step 3a of clause 4.2.3.3, the AMF notifies the SMF that the access type of the PDU session can be changed. The AMF discards any already received N1 SM Container and N2 SM Information. In Home Routed roaming case, the V-SMF triggers Nsmf_PDUSession_Update service operation towards the H-SMF to notify the access type of the PDU Session can be changed and the procedure continues as specified in clause 4.3.3.3 from step 1a to step 10.\nIf the UE is accessing via the NB-IoT RAT, the AMF may inform all (H-)SMFs whether the RRC establishment cause is set to \"MO exception data\", as described in clause 5.31.14.3 of TS 23.501 [2]. The AMF may immediately send the MO Exception Data Counter to the (H-)SMF.\nIf the AMF, based on configuration, as described in clauses 5.43.4 and 5.43.2 of TS 23.501 [2], is aware that satellite backhaul category and/or GEO Satellite ID has changed and needs to be updated to the SMF, the AMF includes the new Satellite backhaul category or new GEO Satellite ID or both as described in clauses 5.43.4 and 5.43.2 of TS 23.501 [2].\nThe AMF may receive a Service Request to establish another NAS signalling connection via a new NG-RAN while it has maintained an old NAS signalling connection for UE still via an old NG-RAN. The new NG-RAN and the old NG-RAN can be the same NG-RAN node. In this case, AMF shall trigger the AN release procedure toward the old NG-RAN to release the old NAS signalling connection as defined in clause 4.2.6 and:\n-\tFor the PDU Sessions indicated by the UE in the List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated, the AMF requests the SMF to activate the PDU Session(s) immediately by performing this step 4; and\nNOTE 5:\tThis activates the UP of PDU Session(s) using resources of the new NG-RAN.\n-\tFor the PDU Sessions indicated by the old NG-RAN in the \"List of PDU Session ID(s) with active N3 user plane\" but not in the List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated sent by the UE, the AMF requests the SMF to deactivate the PDU Session(s).\nNOTE 6:\tThis deactivates the UP of PDU Session(s) that are no more needed by the UE.\n5a.\tVoid.\n5b.\tIf the PDU Session ID corresponds to a LADN and the SMF determines that the UE is outside the area of availability of the LADN based on the \"UE presence in LADN service area\" from the AMF, the SMF decides to (based on local policies) either:\n-\tkeep the PDU Session, but reject the activation of User Plane connection for the PDU Session and inform the AMF about it. If the procedure has been triggered by a Network Triggered Service Request as described in clause 4.3.2.3, the SMF may notify the UPF that originated the Data Notification to discard downlink data for the PDU Sessions and/or to not provide further Data Notification messages; or\n-\tto release the PDU Session: the SMF releases the PDU Session and informs the AMF that the PDU Session is released.\nIn any case of the two cases above the SMF answers to the AMF (step10) with an appropriate reject cause and the User Plane Activation of PDU Session is stopped.\nOtherwise, based on the location info received from the AMF, the SMF checks the UPF Selection Criteria according to clause 6.3.3 of TS 23.501 [2] and determines to perform one of the following:\n-\taccepts the activation of UP connection and continue using the current UPF(s);\n-\taccepts the activation of UP connection and selects a new intermediate UPF (or add/remove an intermediate UPF), if the UE has moved out of the service area of the UPF that was previously connecting to the AN, while maintaining the UPF(s) acting as PDU Session Anchor. The steps to perform I-UPF addition/change/removal are described as conditional steps in the following of the current procedure; or\nNOTE 7:\tIf the old and/or new I-UPF implements an UL CL or BP functionality and a PDU Session Anchor for connectivity to the local access to the Data Network as described in clause 5.6.4.2 of TS 23.501 [2], the signalling described in the current clause is intended as the signalling to add, remove or change the PDU Session Anchor and must be complemented by the signalling to add, release or change the UL CL or BP as described respectively in clauses 4.3.5.4, 4.3.5.5 and 4.3.5.7.\n-\trejects the activation of UP connection of a PDU Session of SSC mode 2 and trigger re-establishment of the PDU Session after Service Request procedure to perform the allocation of a new UPF to act as PDU Session Anchor, e.g. the UE has moved out of the service area of the anchor UPF which is connecting to NG-RAN.\nIn the case that the SMF fails to find suitable I-UPF, the SMF decides to (based on local policies) either:\n-\ttrigger re-establishment of PDU Session. After Service Request procedure, SMF sends N1 SM message to the UE via the AMF by invoking Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer containing the cause indicating PDU Session re-establishment is required for the UE; or\n-\tkeep the PDU Session, but reject the activation request of User Plane connection for the PDU Session and inform the AMF about it; or\n-\trelease the PDU Session after Service Request procedure.\nIf the SMF has determined that the UE is performing Inter-RAT mobility to or from the NB-IoT RAT then the SMF uses the \"PDU Session continuity at inter RAT mobility\" to determine how to handle the PDU Session.\n6a.\t[Conditional] SMF to UPF (PSA): N4 Session Modification Request.\nDepending on the network deployment, the CN Tunnel Info of UPF (PSA) allocated for N3 or N9 interface may be changed during the Service Request procedure, e.g. UPF connected to different IP domains. If different CN Tunnel Info need be used, the SMF sends N4 Session Modification Request message to UPF (PSA) and requests CN Tunnel Info providing the target Network Instance.\n6b.\t[Conditional] UPF (PSA) to SMF: N4 Session Modification Response.\nThe UPF (PSA) sends an N4 Session Establishment Response message to the SMF. The UPF provides CN Tunnel Info to the SMF. The UPF (PSA) associate the CN Tunnel Info with UL Packet detection rules provided by the SMF.\nIf the redundant I-UPFs are used for URLLC, each I-UPF provides UL CN Tunnel Info for N3 interface to the SMF in the N4 Session Establishment Response message.\nIf the redundant N3 tunnels are used for URLLC, the UPF (PSA) provides redundant UL CN Tunnel Info for N3 interface to the SMF in N4 Session Establishment Response message.\n6c.\t[Conditional] SMF to new UPF (intermediate): N4 Session Establishment Request.\nIf the SMF selects a new UPF to act as intermediate UPF for the PDU Session, or if the SMF selects to insert an intermediate UPF for a PDU Session which did not have an intermediate UPF, an N4 Session Establishment Request message is sent to the new UPF, providing Packet detection, Data forwarding, enforcement and reporting rules to be installed on the intermediate UPF. The CN Tunnel Info (on N9) of PSA, i.e. which is used to establish the N9 tunnel, for this PDU Session is also provided to the intermediate UPF.\nIf a new UPF is selected by the SMF to replace the old (intermediate) UPF, the SMF may also include a request for the new UPF to allocate a second tunnel endpoint for buffered DL data from the old I-UPF and to indicate via usage reporting end marker reception on this second tunnel. In this case, the UPF is instructed by the SMF to buffer the DL data it may receive at the same time from the UPF (PSA).\n6d.\tNew UPF (intermediate) to SMF: N4 Session Establishment Response.\nThe new intermediate UPF sends an N4 Session Establishment Response message to the SMF. The UPF provides DL CN Tunnel Info as requested by SMF in step 6c. The SMF starts a timer, to be used in step 22a to release the resource in old intermediate UPF if there is one.\n7a.\t[Conditional] SMF to UPF (PSA): N4 Session Modification Request.\nIf the SMF selects a new UPF to act as intermediate UPF for the PDU Session, the SMF sends N4 Session Modification Request message to PDU Session Anchor UPF, providing DL Tunnel Info from new intermediate UPF. If the new intermediate UPF was added for the PDU Session, the UPF (PSA) begins to send the DL data to the new I-UPF as indicated in the DL CN Tunnel Info. The UPF (PSA) sends one or more \"end marker\" packets for each N9 tunnel to the old I-UPF immediately after switching the path to new I-UPF.\nIf the Service Request is triggered by the network and the SMF removes the old I-UPF but does not replace it with a new I-UPF, the SMF may also include a request for the UPF to allocate a second tunnel endpoint for buffered DL data from the old I-UPF and to indicate end marker reception on this second tunnel via usage reporting. In this case, the UPF (PSA) begins to buffer the DL data it may receive at the same time from the N6 interface. The UPF (PSA) sends one or more \"end marker\" packets for each N9 tunnel to the old I-UPF immediately after switching the path to (R)AN.\n7b.\tThe UPF (PSA) sends N4 Session Modification Response message to SMF.\nIf requested by SMF, the UPF (PSA) sends DL CN tunnel info for the old (intermediate) UPF to the SMF. The SMF starts a timer, to be used in step 22a to release the resource in old intermediate UPF if there is one.\nIf the UPF that connects to RAN is the UPF (PSA) and if the SMF finds that the PDU Session is activated when receiving the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request in step 4 with Operation Type set to \"UP activate\" to indicate establishment of User Plane resources for the PDU Session(s), it deletes the AN Tunnel Info and initiates an N4 Session Modification procedure to remove Tunnel Info of AN in the UPF.\n8a.\t[Conditional] SMF to old UPF (intermediate): N4 Session Modification Request (New UPF address, New UPF DL Tunnel ID)\nIf the service request is triggered by the network and the SMF removes the old (intermediate) UPF, the SMF sends the N4 Session Modification Request message to the old (intermediate) UPF, providing the DL Tunnel Info for the buffered DL data. If the SMF allocated new I-UPF, the DL Tunnel Info is from the new (intermediate) UPF acting as N3 terminating point. If the SMF did not allocate a new I-UPF, the DL Tunnel Info is from the new UPF (PSA) acting as N3 terminating point. The SMF starts a timer to monitor the forwarding tunnel as step 6d or 7b.\nIf the old I-UPF receives end marker packets and there is no associated tunnel to forward these packets, the old I-UPF discards the received end marker packets and does not send any Data Notification to SMF.\nIf the SMF find the PDU Session is activated when receiving the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request in step 4 with Operation Type set to \"UP activate\" to indicate establishment of User Plane resources for the PDU Session(s), it deletes the AN Tunnel Info and initiates an N4 Session Modification procedure to remove Tunnel Info of AN in the UPF.\n8b.\told UPF (intermediate) to SMF: N4 Session Modification Response\nThe old (intermediate) UPF sends N4 Session Modification Response message to SMF.\n9.\t[Conditional] old UPF (intermediate) to new UPF (intermediate): buffered downlink data forwarding\nIf the I-UPF is changed and forwarding tunnel was established to the new I-UPF, the old (intermediate) UPF forwards its buffered data to the new (intermediate) UPF acting as N3 terminating point. If indicated by SMF in step 6c, the new I-UPF reports to SMF when end marker packet is received. Then the SMF initiates N4 Session Modification procedure to indicate the new I-UPF to send the buffered downlink packet(s) received from the UPF (PSA).\n10.\t[Conditional] old UPF (intermediate) to UPF (PSA): buffered downlink data forwarding\nIf the old I-UPF is removed and no new I-UPF is assigned for the PDU Session and forwarding tunnel was established to the UPF (PSA), the old (intermediate) UPF forwards its buffered data to the UPF (PSA) acting as N3 Terminating Point. If indicated by SMF in step 7a, the UPF (PSA) reports to SMF when the end marker packet has been received. Then the SMF initiates N4 Session Modification procedure to request the UPF (PSA) to send the buffered DL data received from the N6 interface.\n11.\t[Conditional] SMF to AMF: Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response (N2 SM information (PDU Session ID, QFI(s), QoS profile(s), CN N3 Tunnel Info, S-NSSAI, User Plane Security Enforcement, UE Integrity Protection Maximum Data Rate, RSN, PDU Session Pair ID), N1 SM Container, Cause) to the AMF. If the UPF that connects to RAN is the UPF (PSA), the N3 CN Tunnel Info is the UL CN Tunnel Info of the UPF (PSA). If the UPF that connects to RAN is the new intermediate UPF, the CN N3 Tunnel Info is the UL Tunnel Info of the intermediate UPF.\nFor the PDU Session with redundant I-UPFs or with redundant N3 tunnels for URLLC, the two UL N3 CN Tunnel Info are included, the SMF also indicates the NG-RAN that one of the CN Tunnel Info is used as the redundancy tunnel of the PDU session as described in clause 5.33.2.2 of TS 23.501 [2].\nThe SMF shall send N1 SM Container and/or N2 SM Information to the AMF when applicable. (e.g. when the SMF was notified from the AMF that the access type of the PDU Session can be changed in step 4).\nFor a PDU Session that the SMF has determined to accept the activation of UP connection in step 5a or 5b, the SMF generates only N2 SM information and sends Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response to the AMF to establish the User Plane(s). The N2 SM information contains information that the AMF shall provide to the NG-RAN. The SMF may indicate for each QoS Flow whether redundant transmission shall be performed by a corresponding redundant transmission indicator. If the SMF decided to change the PSA UPF for the SSC mode 3 PDU Session, the SMF triggers the change of SSC mode 3 PDU Session anchor as an independent procedure described in clause 4.3.5.2 or clause 4.3.5.3 after accepting the activation of UP of the PDU Session.\nFor each QoS Flow, the SMF may at most request one of the following to the NG-RAN:\n-\tECN marking for L4S at NG-RAN in the case of ECN marking for L4S in RAN as described in clause 5.37.3 of TS 23.501 [2]; or,\n-\tCongestion information monitoring as described in clauses 5.45.3 and 5.37.4 of TS 23.501 [2]; or,\n-\tprovide information for ECN marking for L4S at UPF in the case of ECN marking for L4S by PSA UPF as described in clause 5.37.3 of TS 23.501 [2].\nThe SMF can reject the activation of UP of the PDU Session by including a cause in the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response. Following are some of the cases:\n-\tIf the PDU Session corresponds to a LADN and the UE is outside the area of availability of the LADN as described in step 5b;\n-\tIf the AMF notified the SMF that the UE is reachable only for regulatory prioritized service and the PDU Session to be activated is not for a regulatory prioritized service; or\n-\tIf the SMF decided to change the PSA UPF for the requested PDU Session as described in step 5b. In this case, after sending Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response, the SMF triggers another procedure to instruct UE to re-establish the PDU Session as described in clause 4.3.5.1 for SSC mode 2.\n-\tIf the SMF received negative response in Step 6b due to UPF resource unavailability.\nIf the PDU Session has been assigned any EPS bearer ID, the SMF also includes the mapping between EPS bearer ID(s) and QFI(s) into the N2 SM information to be sent to the NG-RAN.\nThe User Plane Security Enforcement information is determined by the SMF upon PDU session establishment as described in clause 5.10.3 of TS 23.501 [2]. If the User Plane Security Enforcement information indicates that Integrity Protection is \"Preferred\" or \"Required\", the SMF also includes the UE Integrity Protection Maximum Data Rate.\nThe RSN and PDU Session Pair ID are included when applicable, as determined by the SMF during PDU Session establishment as described in clause 5.33.2.1 of TS 23.501 [2].\n12.\tAMF to (R)AN: N2 Request (N2 SM information received from SMF, security context, Mobility Restriction List, UE-AMBR, List of UE-Slice-MBR(s) (optional and for 3GPP access type only), MM NAS Service Accept, list of recommended cells / TAs / NG-RAN node identifiers, UE Radio Capability, Core Network Assistance Information, Tracing Requirements, UE Radio Capability ID, QMC Configuration information). The Allowed NSSAI for the Access Type for the UE and if available, Partially Allowed NSSAI (as described in clause 5.15.17 of TS 23.501 [2]), are included in the N2 message. If the subscription information includes Tracing Requirements, the AMF includes Tracing Requirements in the N2 Request. If the subscription information includes QMC Configuration information, the AMF includes QMC Configuration information in the N2 Request.\nIf the UE triggered the Service Request while in CM-CONNECTED state, only N2 SM information received from SMF and MM NAS Service Accept are included in the N2 Request.\nIf the Service Request procedure is triggered by the Network (as described in clause 4.2.3.3) while the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state, only N2 SM information received from SMF is included in the N2 Request.\nIf the Service Request procedure is triggered by the Network (as described in clause 4.2.3.3) while the UE is in CM-IDLE state, only N2 SM information received from SMF and MM NAS Service Accept is included in the N2 Request.\nFor a UE that was in CM-IDLE state when the Service Request was triggered, the NG-RAN stores the Security Context. If the Service Request is not triggered by UE for a signalling connection only, RAN also stores QoS Information for the QoS Flows of the PDU Sessions that are activated and N3 Tunnel IDs in the UE RAN context and Mobility Restriction List (as described in clause 5.3.4.1 of TS 23.501 [2]).\nMM NAS Service Accept includes PDU Session status in AMF. Any local PDU Session Release during the Session Request procedure is indicated to the UE via the Session Status. PDU Session Reactivation Result is provided in Service Accept for the PDU sessions in the List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated and the PDU Session in the List of Allowed PDU Sessions which has caused paging or NAS notification. If the PDU Session Reactivation Result of a PDU Session is failure, the cause of the failure is also provided. One of the possible causes of failure for a PDU Session reactivation is when the AMF determines that the UE is not inside the NS-AoS of the network slice of the PDU Session.\nIf the AMF accepts the Paging Restriction Information sent from the UE, the AMF informs the UE about the acceptance/rejection of the requested Paging Restriction Information in the MM NAS Service Accept message.\nIf AMF receives multiple TAIs from the NG-RAN in step 2 and determines that some, but not all of them are forbidden by subscription or by operator policy, the AMF shall include the forbidden TAI(s) in the MM NAS Service Accept message.\nIf there are multiple PDU Sessions that involves multiple SMFs, AMF does not need to wait for responses from all SMFs in step 11 before it sends N2 SM information to the RAN. However, the AMF shall wait for all responses from the SMFs before it sends MM NAS Service Accept message to the UE.\nAMF shall include at least one N2 SM information from SMF if this step is triggered for PDU Session User Plane activation. AMF may send additional N2 SM information from SMFs in separate N2 message(s) (e.g. N2 tunnel setup request), if there is any. Alternatively, if multiple SMFs are involved, the AMF may send one N2 Request message to (R)AN after all the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response service operations from all the SMFs associated with the UE are received.\nIf the NG-RAN node had provided the list of recommended cells / TAs / NG-RAN node identifiers during the AN Release procedure (see clause 4.2.6), the AMF shall include it in the N2 Request. The NG-RAN may use this information to allocate the RAN Notification Area when the NG-RAN decides to enable RRC_INACTIVE state for the UE.\nThe AMF includes the UE's \"RRC Inactive Assistance Information\" as defined in clause 5.3.3.2.5 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf the NG-RAN node does not support RACS and the AMF have UE Radio Capability ID but not the UE Radio Capability information, then AMF will use Nucmf_UECapabilityManagement_Resolve to try to retrieve the corresponding UE Radio Capability information.\nIf the NG-RAN node does not support RACS, or the AMF does not have UE Radio Capability ID in UE context, the AMF shall include the UE Radio Capability information, if available, to the NG-RAN node as described in TS 23.501 [2]. If the RAT Type is NB-IoT then NB-IoT specific UE Radio Access Capability Information is included instead, if available.\nIf AMF has UE Radio Capability ID in UE context valid for the PLMN the UE is currently in and the NG-RAN supports RACS, the AMF signals the UE Radio Capability ID. If the NG-RAN node does not have mapping between the UE Radio Capability ID and the corresponding UE radio capabilities, it shall use the non-UE associated procedure described in TS 38.413 [10] to retrieve the mapping from the AMF.\nThe AMF may include the Core Network Assistance Information which includes Core Network assisted RAN parameters tuning and Core Network assisted RAN paging information as defined in TS 23.501 [2].\nIf the UE included support for restriction of use of Enhanced Coverage, the AMF sends Enhanced Coverage Restricted information to the (R)AN in the N2 message.\nIf the UE and the AMF have negotiated to enable MICO mode and the AMF uses the Extended connected timer, then the AMF provides the Extended Connected time value to NG-RAN (see clause 5.31.7.3 of TS 23.501 [2]) in this step. The Extended Connected Time value indicates the minimum time the RAN should keep the UE in RRC_CONNECTED state regardless of inactivity.\nIf the AMF accepted MICO mode in the last registration procedure and knows there may be mobile terminated data or signalling pending, the AMF maintains the N2 connection for at least the Extended Connected Time as described in clause 5.31.7.3 of TS 23.501 [2] and provides the Extended Connected Time value to the RAN in N2 message with Service Accept message. The RAN should keep the UE in RRC_CONNECTED state for an Extended Connected Time period in order to ensure the downlink data and/or signalling is delivered to the UE.\nIf the RAN receives two CN Tunnel Info for a PDU session in step 11 for redundant transmission, RAN also allocates two AN Tunnel Info correspondingly and indicate to SMF one of the AN Tunnel Info is used as the redundancy tunnel of the PDU session as described in clause 5.33.2.2 of TS 23.501 [2].\n13.\t(R)AN to UE: The NG-RAN performs RRC Connection Reconfiguration with the UE depending on the QoS Information for all the QoS Flows of the PDU Sessions whose UP connections are activated and Data Radio Bearers. For a UE that was in CM-IDLE state, if the Service Request is not triggered by UE for a signalling connection only, the User Plane security is established at this step, which is described in detail in TS 38.331 [12] and TS 36.331 [16]. For a UE that was in CM-IDLE state, if the Service Request is triggered by UE for a signalling connection only, AS security context may be established in this step, which is described in detail in TS 38.331 [12] and TS 36.331 [16].\nIf the N2 Request includes a NAS message, the NG-RAN forwards the NAS message to the UE. The UE locally deletes context of PDU Sessions that are not available in 5GC.\nNOTE 8:\tThe reception of the Service Accept message does not imply the successful activation of the User Plane radio resources.\nNOTE 9:\tIf not all the requested User Plane AN resources are successfully activated, see TS 38.413 [10].\nAfter the User Plane radio resources are setup, the uplink data from the UE can now be forwarded to NG-RAN. The NG-RAN sends the uplink data to the UPF address and Tunnel ID provided in the step 11.\nIf the NG-RAN can not establish redundant user plane for the PDU Session as indicated by the RSN parameter and PDU Session Pair ID, the NG-RAN takes the decision on how to proceed with the PDU Session as described in TS 23.501 [2].\n14.\t[Conditional] (R)AN to AMF: N2 Request Ack (List of PDU Sessions To Be Established with N2 SM information (AN Tunnel Info, List of accepted QoS Flows for the PDU Sessions whose UP connections are activated, List of rejected QoS Flows for the PDU Sessions whose UP connections are activated, PDU Set Based Handling Support Indication), established QoS Flows status (active/not active) (for one of the following: congestion information monitoring, ECN marking for L4S at PSA UPF, ECN marking for L4S at NG-RAN), List of PDU Sessions that failed to be established with the failure cause given in the N2 SM information element).\nThe message may include N2 SM information(s), e.g. AN Tunnel Info. NG-RAN may respond N2 SM information with separate N2 message (e.g. N2 tunnel setup response) if AMF sends separate N2 message in step 11.\nIf multiple N2 SM information are included in the N2 Request message in step 12, the N2 Request Ack includes multiple N2 SM information and information to enable the AMF to associate the responses to relevant SMF.\nFor List of PDU Sessions To Be Established, if the N2 SM information received from SMF included PDU Set QoS Parameters, NG-RAN includes the PDU Set Based Handling Support Indication in N2 SM information for the PDU Session that enables PDU Set based handling in NG-RAN as described in clause 5.37.5.3 of TS 23.501 [2].\n15.\t[Conditional] AMF to SMF: Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request (N2 SM information, RAT Type, Access Type) per PDU Session to the SMF. The AMF determines Access Type and RAT Type, see clause 4.2.2.2.1.\nIf the AMF received N2 SM information (one or multiple) in step 14, then the AMF shall forward the N2 SM information to the relevant SMF per PDU Session ID. If the UE Time Zone has changed compared to the last reported UE Time Zone then the AMF shall include the UE Time Zone IE in this message.\nIf the PDU Session is moved from the non-3GPP access to 3GPP access (i.e. N3 tunnel for the PDU Session is established successfully), the SMF and AMF update associated access of the PDU Session. The UE updates associated access of the PDU Session when the user plane resource for the PDU Session is successfully established.\nProcedure for unpausing a charging pause initiated earlier is specified in clause 4.4.4.\nIf a PDU Session is rejected by the serving NG-RAN with an indication that the PDU Session was rejected because User Plane Security Enforcement is not supported in the serving NG-RAN and the User Plane Enforcement Policy indicates \"Required\" as described in clause 5.10.3 of TS 23.501 [2], the SMF shall trigger the release of this PDU Session. In all other cases of PDU Session rejection, the SMF can decide whether to release the PDU Session or to deactivate the UP connection of this PDU Session.\nIf some of the QoS Flows of a PDU Session are not accepted by the serving NG-RAN, the SMF shall initiate the PDU Session Modification procedure to remove the non-accepted QoS Flows from the PDU Session after this procedure is completed.\n16.\t[Optional] SMF to PCF: If dynamic PCC is deployed and if Policy Control Request Trigger condition(s) have been met (e.g. change of Access Type, change of UE location), performs SMF initiated SM Policy Modification procedure as defined in clause 4.16.5.1. The PCF may provide updated policies.\n17a.\t[Conditional] SMF to new intermediate UPF: N4 Session Modification Request (AN Tunnel Info and List of accepted QFI(s)).\nIf the SMF selected a new UPF to act as intermediate UPF for the PDU Session in step 5b, the SMF initiates a N4 Session Modification procedure to the new I-UPF and provides AN Tunnel Info. The Downlink Data from the new I-UPF can now be forwarded to NG-RAN and UE.\n17b.\t[Conditional] UPF to SMF: N4 Session Modification Response.\n18a.\t[Conditional] SMF to UPF (PSA): N4 Session Modification Request (AN Tunnel Info, List of rejected QoS Flows).\nIf a User Plane is to be setup or modified and after the modification there is no I-UPF, the SMF initiates a N4 Session Modification procedure to UPF (PSA) and provides AN Tunnel Info. The Downlink Data from the UPF (PSA) can now be forwarded to NG-RAN and UE.\nFor QoS Flows in the List of rejected QoS Flows, the SMF shall instruct the UPF to remove the rules (e.g. Packet Detection Rules etc.) which are associated with the QoS Flows.\nIf SMF decides to perform redundant transmission for one or more QoS Flows of the PDU, the SMF also indicates the UPF (PSA) to perform packet duplication for the QoS Flow(s) in downlink direction by forwarding rules.\nIf the PCC rule(s) are updated in step 16, the SMF may initiate a N4 Session Modification procedure to UPF (PSA) based on the updated PCC rule(s).\n18b.\t[Conditional] UPF to SMF: N4 Session Modification Response.\n19.\t[Conditional] SMF to AMF: Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response.\n20a.\t[Conditional] SMF to new UPF (intermediate): N4 Session Modification Request.\nIf forwarding tunnel has been established to the new I-UPF and if the timer SMF set for forwarding tunnel at step 8a has expired, SMF sends N4 Session modification request to new (intermediate) UPF acting as N3 terminating point to release the forwarding tunnel.\n20b.\t[Conditional] new UPF (intermediate) to SMF: N4 Session modification response.\nNew (intermediate) UPF acting as N3 terminating point sends N4 Session Modification response to SMF.\n21a.\t[Conditional] SMF to UPF (PSA): N4 Session Modification Request.\nIf forwarding tunnel has been established to the UPF (PSA) and if the timer SMF set for forwarding tunnel at step 7b has expired, SMF sends N4 Session modification request to UPF (PSA) acting as N3 Terminating Point to release the forwarding tunnel.\n21b.\t[Conditional] UPF (PSA) to SMF: N4 Session Modification Response.\nUPF (PSA) acting as N3 Terminating Point sends N4 Session Modification Response to SMF.\n22a.\t[Conditional] SMF to old UPF: N4 Session Modification Request or N4 Session Release Request.\nIf the SMF decided to continue using the old UPF in step 5b, the SMF sends an N4 Session Modification Request, providing AN Tunnel Info.\nIf the SMF decided to select a new UPF to act as intermediate UPF in step 5b and the old UPF is not PSA UPF, the SMF initiates resource release, after timer in step 6b or 7b expires, by sending an N4 Session Release Request (Release Cause) to the old intermediate UPF.\n22b.\t[Conditional] Old intermediate UPF to SMF: N4 Session Modification Response or N4 Session Release Response.\nThe old UPF acknowledges with an N4 Session Modification Response or N4 Session Release Response message to confirm the modification or release of resources.\nFor the mobility related events described in clause 4.15.4, the AMF invokes the Namf_EventExposure_Notify service operation after step 4.\nUpon reception of the Namf_EventExposure_Notify with an indication that the UE is reachable, if the SMF has pending DL data the SMF invokes the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation to the AMF to establish the User Plane(s) for the PDU Sessions, otherwise the SMF resumes sending DL data notifications to the AMF in the case of DL data.\nUpon reception of the Namf_EventExposure_Notify with an indication that UE is reachable only for regulatory prioritized service, the SMF deactivates the PDU Session if the service of the PDU Session is not regulatory prioritized. For home routed roaming case, the V-SMF triggers the deactivation of the PDU Session, in addition, the H-SMF refrains from sending downlink signalling if the signalling is not related to regulatory prioritized service upon receiving the notification.",

      "content": "This procedure is used when the network needs to signal (e.g. N1 signalling to UE, Mobile-terminated SMS, User Plane connection activation for PDU Session(s) to deliver mobile terminating user data) with a UE. When the procedure is triggered by SMSF, PCF, LMF, GMLC, NEF, AMF or UDM, the SMF (and UPF, if applicable) in the following figure should be replaced by the respective NF. For MT-SMS delivery request from SMSF, see also procedures defined in clause 4.13.3.6, clause 4.13.3.7 and clause 4.13.3.8. If the UE is in CM-IDLE state or CM-CONNECTED state in 3GPP access, the network initiates a Network Triggered Service Request procedure. If the UE is in CM-IDLE state and asynchronous type communication is not activated, the network sends a Paging Request to (R)AN/UE. The Paging Request triggers the UE Triggered Service Request procedure in the UE. If asynchronous type communication is activated, the network stores the received message and forward the message to the (R)AN and/or the UE (i.e. synchronizes the context with the (R)AN and/or the UE) when the UE enters CM-CONNECTED state.\nIf the UE is in CM-IDLE state in non-3GPP access and if the UE is simultaneously registered over 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses in a PLMN, the network shall initiate a Network Triggered Service Request procedure over 3GPP access.\nIf the UE is in CM-IDLE state in 3GPP access and in CM-CONNECTED state in non-3GPP access and if the UE is simultaneously registered over 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses in the same PLMN, the network may initiate a Network Triggered Service Request procedure for 3GPP access via non-3GPP access.\nFor this procedure, the impacted SMF and UPF are all under control of the PLMN serving the UE, e.g. in Home Routed roaming case the SMF and UPF in HPLMN are not involved.\nThe procedure below covers the following non exhaustive list of use-cases for 3GPP access (detailed conditions of when the steps apply are stated in the procedure below):\n-\tThe SMF needs to setup N3 tunnel to deliver downlink packet to the UE for a PDU Session and the UE is in CM-IDLE state: Step 3a contains an N2 message and Step 4b (paging) is performed.\n-\tThe SMF needs to setup N3 tunnel to deliver downlink packet to the UE for a PDU Session and the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state: Step 3a contains an N2 message and Step 4a (UP reactivation) is performed.\n-\tNF (e.g. SMF, SMSF, PCF or LMF) needs to send an N1 message to the UE, using the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation and the UE is in CM-IDLE state: Step 3a contains an N1 message, Step 3b contains cause \"Attempting to reach UE\" and Step 4b (paging) occurs.\n-\tThe LMF triggers AMF, using the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation, to setup a NAS connection with the UE and the UE is in CM-IDLE state: Step 3b contains cause \"Attempting to reach UE\" and step 4b (paging) occurs.\n-\tThe GMLC triggers AMF, using the Namf_Location_ProvideLocation service operation, to setup a NAS connection with the UE and the UE is in CM-IDLE state: Step 4b (paging) occurs.\n-\tThe PCF needs to send a message to the UE, using the Npcf_AMPolicyControl_Create Response service operation, or the Npcf_AMPolicyControl_UpdateNotify service operation and the UE is in CM-IDLE state: Step 3a contains a message and step 4b (paging) occurs.\n-\tNF (e.g. SMSF or SMF) triggers AMF, using the Namf_MT_EnableUEReachability service operation, to setup a NAS connection with the UE and the UE is in CM-IDLE state: The trigger is specific to the procedure and Step 4b (paging) occurs.\nAs described in clause 4.2.4.2, the AMF may also trigger the Network Triggered Service Request before the AMF sends a UE Configuration Update.\nFigure 4.2.3.3-1: Network Triggered Service Request\n1.\tWhen a UPF receives downlink data for a PDU Session and there is no AN Tunnel Info stored in UPF for the PDU Session, based on the instruction from the SMF (as described in clause 5.8.3 of TS 23.501 [2]), the UPF may buffer the downlink data (steps 2a and 2b), or forward the downlink data to the SMF (step 2c).\n2a.\tUPF to SMF: Data Notification (N4 Session ID, Information to identify the QoS Flow for the DL data packet, DSCP).\n-\tOn arrival of the first downlink data packet for any QoS Flow, the UPF shall send Data Notification message to the SMF, if the SMF has not previously notified the UPF to not send the Data Notification to the SMF (in which case the next steps are skipped).\n-\tIf the UPF receives downlink data packets for another QoS Flow in the same PDU Session, the UPF shall send another Data Notification message to the SMF.\n-\tIf the Paging Policy Differentiation feature (as specified in clause 5.4.3 of TS 23.501 [2]) is supported by the UPF and if the PDU Session type is IP, the UPF shall also include the DSCP in TOS (IPv4) / TC (IPv6) value from the IP header of the downlink data packet and the information to identify the QoS Flow for the DL data packet.\n2b.\tSMF to UPF: Data Notification Ack.\n2c.\tThe UPF forwards the downlink data packets towards the SMF if the SMF instructed the UPF to do so (i.e. the SMF will buffer the data packets).\n-\tIf the Paging Policy Differentiation feature is supported by the SMF and if the PDU Session type is IP, the SMF determines the Paging Policy Indicator based on the DSCP in TOS (IPv4) / TC (IPv6) value from the IP header of the received downlink data packet and identifies the corresponding QoS Flow from the QFI of the received DL data packet.\n3a.\t[Conditional] SMF to AMF: Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer (SUPI, PDU Session ID, N1 SM container (SM message), N2 SM information (QFI(s), QoS profile(s), CN N3 Tunnel Info, S-NSSAI), Area of validity for N2 SM information, ARP, Paging Policy Indicator, 5QI, N1N2TransferFailure Notification Target Address, Extended Buffering support), or NF to AMF: Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer (SUPI, N1 message).\nThe SMF shall not include both N1 SM Container and N2 SM Information in Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer unless the N1 SM Container is related to the N2 SM Information.\nIf this step is triggered by a notification from UPF, upon reception of a Data Notification message, for a PDU Session corresponding to a LADN, the SMF takes actions as specified in clause 5.6.5 of TS 23.501 [2]. The SMF may notify the UPF that originated the Data Notification to discard downlink data for the PDU Sessions and/or to not provide further Data Notification messages.\nOtherwise, the SMF determines whether to contact the AMF. The SMF does not contact the AMF:\n-\tif the SMF had previously been notified that the UE is unreachable; or\n-\tif the UE is reachable only for regulatory prioritized service and the PDU Session is not for regulatory prioritized service.\nThe SMF determines the AMF and invokes the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer to the AMF including the PDU Session ID of the PDU Session. If this step is triggered by a notification from the UPF in step 2a, the SMF determines the PDU Session ID based on the N4 Session ID received in step 2a.\nThe SMF determines whether Extended Buffering applies based on local policy and the capability of the SMF (for SMF-based buffering) or the capability of the UPF (for UPF-based buffering). If Extended Buffering applies, the SMF includes \"Extended Buffering support\" indication in Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer.\nIf the SMF, while waiting for the User Plane Connection to be activated, receives any additional Data Notification message or, in the case that the SMF buffers the data packets, additional data packets for a QoS Flow associated with a higher priority (i.e. ARP priority level) than the priority indicated to the AMF in the previous Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer, or the SMF derive a different Paging Policy Indicator according to the additional Data Notification or the DSCP of the data packet, the SMF invokes a new Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer indicating the higher priority or different Paging Policy Indicator to the AMF.\nIf the SMF, while waiting for the User Plane to be activated, receives a message from a new AMF other than the one to which the SMF invoked theNamf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer, the SMF re-invokes the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer towards the new AMF.\nWhen supporting Paging Policy Differentiation, the SMF determines the Paging Policy Indicator related to the downlink data that has been received from the UPF or triggered the Data Notification message, based on the DSCP as described in clause 5.4.3 of TS 23.501 [2] and indicates the Paging Policy Indicator in the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer.\nNOTE 1:\tAMF may receive request message(s) from other network functions which leads to signalling towards UE/RAN, e.g. Network-initiated Deregistration, SMF initiated PDU Session Modification. If the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state and the AMF only delivers N1 message towards UE, the flow continues in step 6 below.\nThe N2 SM information is optional and is not provided e.g. in the case that the SMF only wants to send an N1 message such as PDU Session Modification Command with only updating the UE with a PCO.\nFor PDU session with user plane in Suspend mode (i.e. applying User Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation as specified in clause 5.31.8 of TS 23.501 [2]) for 3GPP access, the SMF uses Namf_MT_EnableUEReachability service operation if there is neither N1 SM container nor N2 SM information to be delivered by SMF.\n3b.\t[conditional] The AMF responds to the SMF.\nIf the UE is in CM-IDLE state at the AMF and the AMF is able to page the UE the AMF sends a Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer response to the SMF immediately to indicate to the SMF that AMF is attempting to reach UE and the N2 SM information provided in step 3a, may be ignored by the AMF once the UE is reachable and the SMF may be asked to provide the N2 SM information again.\nWhile waiting for the UE to respond to a previous paging request, if the AMF receives an Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer Request message with the same or a lower priority than the previous message triggering the paging, or if the AMF has determined not to trigger additional paging requests for this UE based on local policy, the AMF rejects the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer Request message.\nIf the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state at the AMF then the AMF sends a Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer response to the SMF immediately to indicate that the N1/N2 message has been sent out.\nIf the UE is in CM-IDLE state and the AMF determines that the UE is not reachable for paging, the AMF shall send an Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer response to the NF from which AMF received the request message in step 3a to indicate that the UE is not reachable, or the AMF performs asynchronous type communication and stores the UE context based on the received message, it shall send an Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer response to indicate that asynchronous type communication is invoked. If asynchronous type communication is invoked, the AMF initiates communication with the UE and (R)AN when the UE is reachable e.g. when the UE enters CM-CONNECTED state.\nIf the AMF detects that the UE context contains Paging Restriction Information, the AMF may block the paging for this UE, based on local policy and the stored Paging Restriction Information (see clause 5.38.1 of TS 23.501 [2]). If the AMF blocks paging, the AMF sends Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer response with an indication that its request has been rejected due to restricted paging to the NF from which AMF received the request message in step 3a.\nIf the AMF has determined the UE is unreachable for the SMF (e.g. due to the UE in MICO mode, the UE using extended idle mode DRX or the UE is only registered over non-3GPP access and its state is CM-IDLE), then the AMF rejects the request from the SMF. The AMF may include in the reject message an indication that the SMF need not trigger the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer Request to the AMF, if the SMF has not subscribed to the event of the UE reachability. If the SMF included the Extended Buffering Support indication, the AMF indicates the Estimated Maximum Wait time, in the reject message, for the SMF to determine the Extended Buffering time. If the UE is in MICO mode, the AMF determines the Estimated Maximum Wait time based on the next expected periodic registration by the UE or by implementation. If the UE is using extended idle mode DRX, the AMF determines the Estimated Maximum Wait time based on the start of the next Paging Time Window. The AMF stores an indication that the SMF has been informed that the UE is unreachable.\nIf the AMF has determined the UE is reachable and the AMF detects the UE is in a Non-Allowed Area unless the request from the SMF is for regulatory prioritized service, the AMF rejects the request from the SMF and notifies the SMF that the UE is reachable only for regulatory prioritized service. The AMF stores an indication that the SMF has been informed that the UE is reachable only for regulatory prioritized service. If the AMF cannot determine whether the UE is in a Non-Allowed Area (e.g. due to UE's Registration Area containing both Allowed area and Non-Allowed Area), the procedure continues in step 4.\nIf the Registration procedure with AMF change is in progress when the old AMF receives the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer, the old AMF may reject the request with an indication that the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer has been temporarily rejected.\nUpon reception of an Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer response with an indication that its request has been temporarily rejected, the SMF shall start a locally configured guard timer and wait for any message to come from an AMF. Upon reception of a message from an AMF, the SMF shall re-invoke the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer (with N2 SM info and/or N1 SM info) to the AMF from which it received the message. Otherwise the SMF takes the step 3c at expiry of the guard timer. If the SMF decides that the control plane buffering applies, the SMF shall request UPF to start forwarding the downlink data PDU towards the SMF.\n3c.\t[Conditional] SMF responds to the UPF\nSMF may notify the UPF about the User Plane setup failure.\nIf the SMF receives an indication from the AMF that the UE is unreachable or reachable only for regulatory prioritized service and the SMF determines that Extended Buffering does not apply, the SMF may, based on network policies, either:\n-\tindicate to the UPF to stop sending Data Notifications;\n-\tindicate to the UPF to stop buffering DL data and discard the buffered data;\n-\tindicate to the UPF to stop sending Data Notifications and stop buffering DL data and discard the buffered data; or\n-\trefrains from sending further Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer message for DL data to the AMF while the UE is unreachable.\nThen the SMF subscribes to the AMF for UE reachability event notifications.\nBased on operator policies, the SMF applies the pause of charging procedure as specified in clause 4.4.4.\nIf the SMF receives an indication from the AMF that the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer message requested from an SMF has been temporarily rejected, the SMF may, based on network policies, indicate to the UPF to apply temporary buffering.\nIf the SMF receives an \"Estimated Maximum Wait time\" from the AMF and Extended Buffering applies, the SMF may either:\n-\tIf the DL data buffering in the SMF applies, store the DL Data for an Extended Buffering time. The SMF does not send any additional Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer message if subsequent downlink data packets are received. If the Extended Buffering timer expires, the SMF discards the buffered downlink data.\n-\tIf the DL data buffering in the UPF applies, send a Failure indication with an indication to the UPF to buffer the DL data with an Extended Buffering time and optionally a DL Buffering Suggested Packet Count. The Suggested Number of Downlink Packets network configuration parameter (if available) may be used to derive the value for DL Buffering Suggested Packet Count. The SMF may also indicate to the UPF to stop sending Data Notifications.\nThe Extended Buffering time is determined by the SMF and should be larger or equal to the Estimated Maximum Wait time received from the AMF.\nIf the UPF receives an Extended Buffering indication from the SMF, the UPF initiates Extended Buffering of the downlink data and starts an Extended Buffering timer. If the Extended Buffering timer expires, the UPF discards the buffered downlink data.\n4a.\t[Conditional] If the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state in the access associated with the PDU Session ID received from the SMF in step 3a, the steps 4 to 22 in UE Triggered Service Request procedure (see clause 4.2.3.2) are performed for this PDU Session (i.e. establish the radio resources and in the case that the User Plane is to be activated, to establish the N3 tunnel) without sending a Paging message to the (R)AN node and the UE. In step 12 of clause 4.2.3.2, the AMF does not send the NAS Service Accept message to the UE. The rest of this procedure is omitted.\n4b.\t[Conditional] If the UE is in CM-IDLE state in 3GPP access and the PDU Session ID received from the SMF in step 3a has been associated with 3GPP access and based on local policy the AMF decides to notify the UE through 3GPP access even when UE is in CM-CONNECTED state for non-3GPP access, the AMF may send a Paging message to NG-RAN node(s) via 3GPP access.\nIf the UE is simultaneously registered over 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses in the same PLMN, the UE is in CM-IDLE state in both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access and the PDU Session ID in step 3a is associated with non-3GPP access, the AMF sends a Paging message with associated access \"non-3GPP\" to NG-RAN node(s) via 3GPP access.\nIf the UE is in RM-REGISTERED state and CM-IDLE and reachable in 3GPP access, the AMF sends a Paging message (NAS ID for paging, Registration Area list, Paging DRX length, Paging Priority, access associated to the PDU Session, Enhanced Coverage Restricted information, WUS Assistance Information) to (R)AN node(s) belonging to the Registration Area(s) in which the UE is registered, then the NG-RAN node pages the UE, including the access associated to the PDU Session in the paging message if received from the AMF, see TS 38.331 [12]. If extended idle mode DRX was accepted by the AMF in the last registration procedure, the AMF includes extended idle mode DRX cycle length and Paging Time Window in the Paging message. The AMF shall ensure that the correct Paging DRX length is provided based on the accepted UE Specific DRX of the current RAT.\nNOTE 2:\tThe usage of the Access associated with a PDU Session when paging an UE is defined in clause 5.6.8 of TS 23.501 [2].\nNOTE 3:\tThis step is performed also when the UE and the network support User Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation and the previous RRC connection has been suspended. For PDU session in Suspend mode, the SMF uses the service operation as described in step 3a.\nDifferent paging strategies may be configured in the AMF for different combinations of DNN, Paging Policy Indicator (if supported), ARP and 5QI.\nFor RRC_INACTIVE state, the paging strategies may be configured in the (R)AN for different combinations of Paging Policy Indicator, ARP and 5QI.\nPaging Priority is included only:\n-\tif the AMF receives an Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer message with an ARP value associated with priority services (e.g. MPS, MCS), as configured by the operator.\n-\tif the AMF receives an Nudm_SDM_Notification message for a change in priority subscription (e.g. MPS), with a priority value as configured by the operator.\n-\tOne Paging Priority level can be used for multiple ARP values. The mapping of ARP values to Paging Priority level (or levels) is configured by operator policy in the AMF and in NG-RAN.\nThe (R)AN may prioritise the paging of UEs according to the Paging Priority.\nIf the AMF, while waiting for a UE response to the Paging Request message sent without Paging Priority, receives an Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer message, which indicates an ARP value associated with priority services (e.g. MPS, MCS), as configured by the operator, the AMF shall send another paging message with the suitable Paging Priority. For subsequent received Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer messages with the same or higher priority, the AMF may determine whether to send the Paging message with suitable Paging Priority based on local policy.\nIf the AMF has assigned PEIPS Assistance Information, the AMF shall provide the information. The NG-RAN uses this information as described in TS 23.501 [2].\nPaging strategies may include:\n-\tpaging retransmission scheme (e.g. how frequently the paging is repeated or with what time interval);\n-\tdetermining whether to send the Paging message to the (R)AN nodes during certain AMF high load conditions;\n-\twhether to apply sub-area based paging (e.g. first page in the last known cell-id or TA and retransmission in all registered TAs).\nNOTE 4:\tSetting of Paging Priority in the Paging message is independent from any paging strategy.\nThe AMF and the (R)AN may support further paging optimisations in order to reduce the signalling load and the network resources used to successfully page a UE by one or several of the following means:\n-\tby the AMF implementing specific paging strategies (e.g. the N2 Paging message is sent to the (R)AN nodes that served the UE last);\n-\tby the AMF considering Information On Recommended Cells And NG-RAN nodes provided by the (R)AN at transition to CM-IDLE state. The AMF takes the (R)AN nodes related part of this information into account to determine the (R)AN nodes to be paged and provides the information on recommended cells within the N2 Paging message to each of these (R)AN nodes;\n-\tby the (R)AN considering the Paging Attempt Count Information provided by the AMF at paging.\nIf the UE Radio Capability for Paging Information is available in the AMF, the AMF adds the UE Radio Capability for Paging Information in the N2 Paging message to the (R)AN nodes.\nIf the Information On Recommended Cells And (R)AN nodes For Paging is available in the AMF, the AMF shall take that information into account to determine the (R)AN nodes for paging and when paging a (R)AN node, the AMF may transparently convey the information on recommended cells to the (R)AN node.\nThe AMF may include in the N2 Paging message(s) the paging attempt count information. The paging attempt count information shall be the same for all (R)AN nodes selected by the AMF for paging.\nIf the AMF has Paging Assistance Data for CE capable UE stored in the UE Context in AMF and Enhanced Coverage is not restricted for the UE then the AMF shall include Paging Assistance Data for CE capable UE in the N2 paging message for all NG-RAN nodes selected by the AMF for paging.\nThe AMF may include in the N2 Paging message(s) the WUS Assistance Information, if available. If the WUS Assistance Information is included by the N2 Paging message, the NG-eNB takes it into account when paging the UE (see TS 36.300 [46]).\nThe AMF may include in the N2 paging message the PLMN ID(s) of Serving PLMN and equivalent PLMN(s) supported by NG-RAN and corresponding CAG information per PLMN ID which including an Allowed CAG list and optionally an indication whether the UE is only allowed to access 5GS via CAG cells, if available. If the above information is included in N2 paging message, the NG-RAN node may take it into account when determining the cells where paging will be performed (see TS 38.413 [10]).\nIf the UE and NG-eNB support WUS, then:\n-\tif the NGAP Paging message contains the Assistance Data for Recommended Cells IE (see TS 38.413 [10]), the NG-eNB shall only broadcast the UE's Wake Up Signal in the last used cell;\n-\telse (i.e. the Assistance Data for Recommended Cells IE is not included in the NGAP Paging message) the eNodeB should not broadcast the UE's Wake Up Signal.\nIf the network supports the Paging Cause Indication for Voice Service feature and if the UE context in the AMF indicates that the UE supports the Paging Cause Indication for Voice Service feature, the AMF should provide the Voice Service Indication in the NGAP Paging message only when the AMF detects that the downlink data which triggers the Paging message is related to voice service, as specified in clause 5.38.3 of TS 23.501 [2]. If the NG RAN supporting the Paging Cause Indication for Voice Service feature receives the Voice Service Indication, it provides the Voice Service Indication in the Paging message and sends the Paging message to the UE.\n4c.\t[Conditional] If the UE is simultaneously registered over 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses in the same PLMN and the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state in 3GPP access and the PDU Session ID in step 3a is associated with non-3GPP access, the AMF sends a NAS Notification message containing the non-3GPP Access Type to the UE over 3GPP access and sets a Notification timer. Step 5 is omitted.\nIf the UE is simultaneously registered over 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses in the same PLMN and the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state for non-3GPP access and in CM-IDLE for 3GPP access and if the PDU Session ID in step 3a is associated with 3GPP access and based on local policy the AMF decides to notify the UE through non-3GPP access, the AMF may send a NAS Notification message containing the 3GPP Access Type to the UE over non-3GPP access and sets a Notification timer. If the network supports the Paging Cause Indication for Voice Service feature and if the UE context in the AMF indicates that the UE supports the Paging Cause Indication for Voice Service feature and the AMF detects that the downlink data is related to voice service, as specified in clause 5.38.3 of TS 23.501 [2], the AMF shall send Paging message over 3GPP access as specified in step 4b.\nNOTE 5:\tThis step is performed also when the UE and the network support User Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation in 3GPP access and the previous RRC connection has been suspended.\n5.\t[Conditional] AMF to SMF: Namf_Communication_N1N2Transfer Failure Notification.\nThe AMF supervises the paging procedure with a timer. If the AMF receives no response from the UE to the Paging Request message, the AMF may apply further paging according to any applicable paging strategy described in step 4b.\nThe AMF notifies the SMF by sending Namf_Communications_N1N2MessageTransfer Failure Notification to the Notification Target Address provided by the SMF in step 3a if the UE does not respond to paging, unless the AMF is aware of an ongoing MM procedure that prevents the UE from responding, i.e. the AMF receives an N14 Context Request message indicating that the UE performs Registration procedure with another AMF.\nWhen a Namf_Communication_N1N2Transfer Failure Notification is received, SMF informs the UPF (if applicable).\nProcedure for pause of charging at SMF is specified in clause 4.4.4.\n6.\tIf the UE is in CM-IDLE state in 3GPP access, upon reception of paging request for a PDU Session associated to 3GPP access, the UE shall initiate the UE Triggered Service Request procedure (clause 4.2.3.2) or, if the UE is enabled to use User Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation and there is suspended access stratum context stored in the UE, the UE initiates the Connection Resume in CM-IDLE with Suspend procedure (clause 4.8.2.3). To support the buffered data forwarding, the SMF instruct the UPF to establish a Data forwarding tunnel between the old UPF and the new UPF or to the PSA as described at steps 6a, 7a, 8a of clause 4.2.3.2.\nIf the UE is in CM-IDLE state in 3GPP access and is using the Multi-USIM Paging Rejection feature (see clause 5.38 of TS 23.501 [2]), upon reception of paging request and if the UE determines not to accept the paging, the UE attempts to send a Reject Paging Indication via the UE Triggered Service Request procedure (clause 4.2.3.2) unless it is unable to do so e.g. due to UE implementation constraints.\nIf the UE is in CM-IDLE state in both non-3GPP and 3GPP accesses, upon reception of paging request for a PDU Session associated to non-3GPP access, the UE shall initiate the UE Triggered Service Request procedure (clause 4.2.3.2) which shall contain the List Of Allowed PDU Sessions that, according to UE policies and whether the S-NSSAIs of these PDU Sessions are within the Allowed NSSAI or Partially Allowed NSSAI, if the serving cell is in a TA where the S-NSSAIs are supported or in a serving cell where the S-NSSAIs are available (according to clause 5.15.18 of TS 23.501 [2]) for 3GPP access, can be re-activated over the 3GPP access. If there is no PDU Session that can be re-activated over the 3GPP access, the UE includes an empty List Of Allowed PDU Sessions. If the AMF receives a Service Request message from the UE via non-3GPP access as described in clause 4.12.4.1 (e.g. because the UE successfully connects to a non-3GPP access), the AMF stops the paging procedure and processes the received Service Request procedure. If the AMF receives the Service Request message and the List Of Allowed PDU Sessions provided by the UE does not include the PDU Session for which the UE was paged, the AMF notifies the SMF that the UE was reachable but did not accept to re-activate the PDU Session by invoking Namf_EventExposure_Notify service as described in step 4 of clause 4.2.3.2.\nIf the UE is in CM-IDLE state in non-3GPP access and in CM-CONNECTED state in 3GPP access, upon reception of NAS Notification message over 3GPP access containing the non-3GPP Access Type, the UE shall initiate the UE Triggered Service Request procedure (clause 4.2.3.2) with the List Of Allowed PDU Sessions that, according to UE policies and whether the S-NSSAIs of these PDU Sessions are within the Allowed NSSAI or Partially Allowed NSSAI, if the serving cell is in a TA where the S-NSSAIs are supported or in a serving cell where the S-NSSAIs are available (according to clause 5.15.18 of TS 23.501 [2]) for 3GPP access, can be re-activated over the 3GPP access. If there is no PDU Session that can be re-activated over the 3GPP access, the UE include an empty List Of Allowed PDU Sessions. When the AMF receives the Service Request message and the List of Allowed PDU Sessions provided by the UE does not include the PDU Session for which the UE was notified, the AMF notifies the SMF that the UE was reachable but did not accept to re-activate the PDU Session by invoking Namf_EventExposure_Notify service. If the AMF receives a Service Request message from the UE via non-3GPP access as described in clause 4.12.4.1 (e.g. because the UE successfully connects to a non-3GPP access), the AMF stops the Notification timer and processes the received Service Request procedure.\n-\tAlternatively, if the UE is in CM-IDLE state in non-3GPP access with the Mobility Management back-off timer running, upon reception of Paging Message over 3GPP access containing the non-3GPP Access Type, the UE on stopping the back-off timer (for both accesses), shall initiate the UE Triggered Service Request procedure (clause 4.12.4.1) over non-3GPP access if non-3GPP access is available. When the AMF receives a Service Request message from the UE via non-3GPP access, the AMF stops the Paging timer and processes the received Service Request.\nNOTE 6:\tA scenario where the UE is CM-IDLE over non-3GPP access and yet non-3GPP access is available, is when the UE over the non-3GPP access is running the Mobility Management back-off timer and network has released the NAS signalling connection upon service reject.\nIf the UE is in CM-IDLE state in 3GPP access and in CM-CONNECTED state in non-3GPP access, upon reception of NAS Notification message over non-3GPP access identifying the 3GPP access type, the UE shall initiate the UE triggered Service Request procedure (clause 4.2.3.2) over the 3GPP access when 3GPP access is available. The Multi-USIM UE may not be able to trigger Service Request procedure (clause 4.2.3.2) over the 3GPP access to response the NAS Notification, e.g. due to UE implementation constraints. If the AMF does not receive the Service Request message before Notification timer expires, the AMF may either page the UE through 3GPP access or notify the SMF that the UE was not able to re-activate the PDU Session.\nThe User Plane of all PDU Sessions for URLLC shall be activated during the Service Request procedure if the UE initiates the Service Request from 3GPP access in CM-IDLE state as described in clause 4.2.3.2.\n6a.\tAfter receiving the Reject Paging Indication, the AMF notifies the SMF using the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer Failure Notification that the UE rejected the page and no user plane connection will be established. The UE remains reachable for future paging attempts.\nIf the AMF detects the UE is in a Non-Allowed Area unless the request from the SMF is for regulatory prioritized service, the AMF rejects the request from the SMF and notifies the SMF that the UE is reachable only for regulatory prioritized service. The AMF stores an indication that the SMF has been informed that the UE is reachable only for regulatory prioritized service.\n7.\tIf the AMF has paged the UE to trigger the Service Request Procedure, the AMF shall initiate the UE configuration update procedure as defined in clause 4.2.4.2 to assign a new 5G-GUTI. If the UE response in the Service Request includes a Reject Paging Indication, the AMF triggers the release of the UE as specified in clause 4.2.3.2.\n8.\tThe UPF transmits the buffered downlink data toward UE via (R)AN node which performed the Service Request procedure. If data is buffered in the SMF, the SMF delivers buffered downlink data to the UPF.\nThe network also sends downlink signalling to the UE if the procedure is triggered due to request from other NFs, as described in step 3a.",

      "content": "This procedure is initiated by the AMF when the AMF wants to update access and mobility management related parameters in the UE configuration.\nThis procedure is also used to trigger UE to perform, based on network indication, either Mobility Registration Update procedure while the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state to modify NAS parameters that require negotiation (e.g. MICO mode) or to steer the UE towards EPC as specified in clause 5.31.3 of TS 23.501 [2], or Mobility Registration Update procedure after the UE enters CM-IDLE state (e.g. for changes to Allowed NSSAI that require re-registration) or to update the UE with the Alternative S-NSSAI. If a Registration procedure is needed, the AMF provides an indication to the UE to initiate a Registration procedure.\nUE Configuration Update shall be sent over the Access Type (i.e. 3GPP access or non-3GPP access) the UE Configuration Update is applied to, when applicable. If the AMF wants to update NAS parameters in the UE which require UE acknowledgement, then the AMF provides an indication to the UE of whether the UE shall acknowledge the command or not. The AMF should not request acknowledgement of the NITZ command. The AMF shall request acknowledgement for NSSAI information (e.g. Allowed NSSAI, Partially Allowed NSSAI, S-NSSAI rejected partially in the RA), 5G-GUTI, TAI List, [TAI List for S-NSSAIs in Partially Allowed NSSAI], [TAI List for S-NSSAI(s) rejected partially in RA] and Mobility Restrictions, LADN Information, MICO, Operator-defined access category definitions, PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID, S-NSSAI location availability information and SMS subscription.\nFigure 4.2.4.2-1: UE Configuration Update procedure for access and mobility management related parameters\n0.\tAMF determines the necessity of UE configuration change due to various reasons (e.g. UE mobility change, NW policy, reception of Subscriber Data Update Notification from UDM, change of Network Slice configuration (including due to change of the NSSRG information in subscription information as specified in clause 5.15.12 of TS 23.501 [2], or due to change of NSAG Information as specified in clause 5.15.14 of TS 23.501 [2]), or to remove S-NSSAI from the Allowed NSSAI due to expiry of slice deregistration inactivity timer or to provide the UE with updated Slice Usage Policy as specified in clause 5.15.15 of TS 23.501 [2], need to assign PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID, change of Enhanced Coverage Restriction information in the UE context, informing MBSR (IAB-UE) authorization state changes as specified in clause 5.35A.4 of TS 23.501 [2] based on operator configuration, a change related to discontinuous coverage (e.g. out-of-coverage period change), need to notify the UE to reconnect to the network due to NG-RAN timing synchronization status change as specified in clause 4.15.9.4) or that the UE needs to perform a Registration Procedure. If a UE is in CM-IDLE, the AMF can wait until the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state or triggers Network Triggered Service Request (in clause 4.2.3.3).\nNOTE 1:\tIt is up to the network implementation whether the AMF can wait until the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state or trigger the Network Triggered Service Request.\nNOTE 2:\tThe AMF can check whether Network Slice configuration needs to be updated by using the Nnssf_NSSelection_Get service operation and in such case the AMF compares the stored information with the output from the NSSF to decide whether an update of the UE is required.\nThe AMF may include Mobility Restriction List in N2 message that delivers UE Configuration Update Command to the UE if the service area restriction for the UE is updated.\n1.\tThe AMF sends UE Configuration Update Command containing one or more UE parameters (Configuration Update Indication, 5G-GUTI, TAI List, Allowed NSSAI, Mapping Of Allowed NSSAI, [Partially Allowed NSSAI], [Mapping Of Partially Allowed NSSAI], [TAI List for S-NSSAIs in Partially Allowed NSSAI], Configured NSSAI for the Serving PLMN, Mapping Of Configured NSSAI, [NSSRG Information], rejected S-NSSAIs, [TAI List for S-NSSAI(s) rejected partially in RA], NITZ, Mobility Restrictions, LADN Information, MICO, Operator-defined access category definitions, SMS Subscribed Indication, [PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID], [PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID deletion indication], [\"List of PLMN(s) to be used in Disaster Condition\"], [Disaster Roaming wait range information], [Disaster Return wait range information], [MPS priority], [MCX priority], [UAS services Indication], MBSR authorization information, [S-NSSAI location availability information], [Mapping Of Alternative NSSAI], UE reconnection indication, [Slice Usage Policy], [Maximum Time Offset]) to the UE. Optionally, the AMF may update the rejected S-NSSAIs in the UE Configuration Update command.\nThe AMF includes one or more of 5G-GUTI, TAI List, Allowed NSSAI, Mapping Of Allowed NSSAI, Partially Allowed NSSAI, Mapping Of Partially Allowed NSSAI, [TAI List for S-NSSAIs in Partially Allowed NSSAI], Configured NSSAI for the Serving PLMN, Mapping Of Configured NSSAI, rejected S-NSSAIs, [TAI List for S-NSSAI(s) rejected partially in RA], NITZ (Network Identity and Time Zone), Mobility Restrictions parameters, LADN Information, Operator-defined access category definitions, PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID, or SMS Subscribed Indication if the AMF wants to update these NAS parameters without triggering a UE Registration procedure.\nThe AMF may include in the UE Configuration Update Command also Configuration Update Indication parameters indicating whether:\n-\tNetwork Slicing Subscription Change has occurred;\n-\tthe UE shall acknowledge the command; and\n-\twhether a Registration procedure is requested.\nIf the AMF indicates Network Slicing Subscription Change, then the UE shall locally erase all the network slicing configuration for all PLMNs and if applicable, update the configuration for the current PLMN based on any received information. If the AMF indicates Network Slicing Subscription Change, the UE shall also be requested to acknowledge in step 2.\nIf the AMF also includes in the UE Configuration Update Command message a new Configured NSSAI for the Serving PLMN, then the AMF should also include a new Allowed NSSAI with, if available, the associated Mapping Of Allowed NSSAI, unless the AMF cannot determine the new Allowed NSSAI after the Subscribed S-NSSAI(s) are updated, in which case the AMF does not include in the UE Configuration Update Command message any Allowed NSSAI. If the UE has indicated its support of the subscription-based restrictions to simultaneous registration of network slices feature in the UE 5GMM Core Network Capability, the AMF includes, if available, the NSSRG Information, defined in clause 5.15.12 of TS 23.501 [2]. If the UE has not indicated its support of the subscription-based restrictions to simultaneous registration of network slices feature and the subscription information for the UE includes NSSRG information and the AMF is providing the Configured NSSAI to the UE, the Configured NSSAI shall include the S-NSSAIs according to clause 5.15.12 of TS 23.501 [2]. For a non-roaming UE, if the UE has indicated its support of Slice Usage Policy in the UE 5GMM Core Network Capability, the AMF may include Slice Usage Policies for slices in the Configured NSSAI as described in clause 5.15.15 of TS 23.501 [2]. In the Slice Usage Policy, the AMF indicates an S-NSSAI is on demand slice and slice deregistration inactivity timer value. If the AMF includes slice deregistration timer value, the UE starts any slice deregistration inactivity timer for the on demand S-NSSAIs as described in clause 5.15.15 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf the UE has indicated its support of NSAG feature in 5GMM Core Network Capability, the AMF includes, if available, the NSAG Information, defined in clause 5.15.14 of TS 23.501 [2] when providing a new Configured NSSAI which includes S-NSSAIs with associated NSAG Value(s) or when the NSAG Information changes for some S-NSSAI in the Configured NSSAI. When NSAG Information is provided to the UE, the AMF requests the UE to acknowledge the UE Configuration Command message.\nWhen the UE and the AMF supports RACS as defined in clause 5.4.4.1a of TS 23.501 [2] and the AMF needs to configure the UE with a UE Radio Capability ID and the AMF already has the UE radio capabilities other than NB-IoT radio capabilities for the UE and the AMF may provide the UE with the UE Radio Capability ID for the UE radio capabilities the UCMF returns to the AMF in a Nucmf_assign service operation for this UE.\nIf the UE is needed to be redirected to the dedicated frequency band(s) for S-NSSAI(s), the AMF may determine a Target NSSAI, as described in clause 5.3.4.3.3 of TS 23.501 [2], itself or by interacting with the NSSF using Nnssf_NSSelection_Get which includes e.g. the Rejected S-NSSAI(s) for RA and Allowed NSSAI. The AMF may determine RFSP index associated to the Target NSSAI by interacting with the PCF using Npcf_AMPolicyControl_Update which includes the Target NSSAI to retrieve a corresponding RFSP index or based on local configuration in case PCF is not deployed. The Target NSSAI and the RFSP index associated with the Target NSSAI are provided to the NG-RAN within the N2 message carrying the UE Configuration Update Command message.\nIf the UE and AMF supports Disaster Roaming service, the AMF may include the \"list of PLMN(s) to be used in Disaster Condition\", Disaster Roaming wait range information and Disaster Return wait range information as specified in TS 23.501 [2]. When the disaster condition is no longer applicable, the serving AMF that provides Disaster Roaming service may notify the UE as specified in clause 5.40.5 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf the AMF receives a Subscriber Data Update Notification from the UDM that includes MPS priority or MCX priority, the AMF includes MPS priority or MCX priority in the UE Configuration Update Command, respectively, as specified in clause 5.22.2 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf UAS service becomes enabled or disabled (e.g. because the aerial subscription is part of the UE subscription data retrieved from UDM changes), the AMF may include an Indication of UAS services being enabled or disabled in the UE Configuration Update Command.\nIf the UE indicates its support of LADN per DNN and S-NSSAI in the UE MM Core Network Capability during the Registration procedure as specified in clause 4.2.2.2.2, the AMF may include LADN Information per DNN and S-NSSAI.\nFor MBSR (IAB-UE) registered in AMF, the AMF may update the MBSR authorization information as specified in clause 5.35A.4 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf the UE indicated a support for the Network Slice Replacement feature in the 5GMM Core Network Capability and the AMF determines that an S-NSSAI from an Allowed NSSAI is to be replaced with an Alternative S-NSSAI (as described in clause 5.15.19 of TS 23.501 [2]), the AMF includes the Mapping Of Alternative NSSAI within the UE Configuration Update Command to the UE and also adds the Alternative S-NSSAI to the Allowed NSSAI and/or Configured NSSAI, if not already included.\nIf both the UE and the network support unavailability due to discontinuous coverage, the AMF determines this Maximum Time Offset as described in clause 5.4.13.5 of TS 23.501 [2]. The AMF includes the Maximum Time Offset within the UE Configuration Update Command to the UE.\n2a.\tIf the UE Configuration Update Indication requires acknowledgement of the UE Configuration Update Command, then the UE shall send a UE Configuration Update complete message to the AMF. The AMF should request acknowledgement for all UE Configuration Updates, except when only NITZ is provided. If Registration procedure is not required, steps 3a, 3b, 3c and step 4 are skipped. If the Configuration Update Indication is included in the UE Configuration Update Command message and it requires a Registration procedure, depending on the other NAS parameters included in the UE Configuration Update command, the UE shall execute steps 3a or 3b or 3c+4 as applicable.\nIf the PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID is included in step1, the AMF stores the UE Radio Capability ID in UE context if receiving UE Configuration Update complete message.\nIf the UE receives PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID deletion indication in step 1, the UE shall delete the PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID(s) for this PLMN. If UE Configuration Update is only for this purpose, the following steps are skipped.\n2b.\t[Conditional] The AMF also uses the Nudm_SDM_Info service operation to provide an acknowledgment to UDM that the UE received CAG information as part of the Mobility Restrictions (if the CAG information was updated), or the Network Slicing Subscription Change Indication (if this was indicated in step 1) and acted upon it.\n2c.\t[Conditional] If the AMF has reconfigured the 5G-GUTI over 3GPP access, the AMF informs the NG-RAN of the new UE Identity Index Value (derived from the new 5G-GUTI) when the AMF receives the acknowledgement from the UE in step 2a.\n[Conditional] If the UE is registered to the same PLMN via both 3GPP and non-3GPP access and if the AMF has reconfigured the 5G-GUTI over non-3GPP access and the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state over 3GPP access, then the AMF informs the NG-RAN of the new UE Identity Index Value (derived from the new 5G-GUTI) when the AMF receives the acknowledgement from the UE in step 2a.\n[Conditional] If the AMF has configured the UE with a PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID, the AMF informs NG-RAN of the UE Radio Capability ID, when it receives the acknowledgement from the UE in step 2a.\n[Conditional] If the Mobility Restrictions for the UE were updated and the Mobility Restrictions were not provided in the N2 message that delivers the UE Configuration Update Command, the AMF provides the NG-RAN with updated Mobility Restrictions unless the AMF releases the UE in this step (see below).\nIf the AMF initiated the UE Configuration Update procedure due to receiving Nudm_SDM_Notification and the CAG information has changed such that a CAG Identifier has been removed from the Allowed CAG list or the UE is only allowed to access CAG cells, the AMF shall release the NAS signalling connection by triggering the AN Release procedure for UEs that are not receiving Emergency Services as defined in TS 23.501 [2].\nIf the AMF need to update Allowed CAG list to the NG-RAN due to change of validity condition as described in TS 23.501 [2], the AMF may either update NG-RAN and keep the NAS signalling connection or release the NAS signalling connection by triggering the AN Release procedure, without updating Allowed CAG list to the NG-RAN, for the UEs that are not receiving Emergency Services as defined in TS 23.501 [2].\nNOTE 3:\tIf validity condition needs to be applied immediately before the NG-RAN enforces Allowed CAG list, the AMF can trigger AN Release without sending updated Allowed CAG list to the NG-RAN.\nNOTE 4:\tWhen the UE is accessing the network for emergency service the conditions in clause 5.16.4.3 of TS 23.501 [2] apply.\n2d\t[Conditional] If the UE is configured with a new 5G-GUTI in step 2a via non-3GPP access and the UE is registered to the same PLMN via both 3GPP and non-3GPP access, then the UE passes the new 5G-GUTI to its 3GPP access' lower layers.\nIf the UE is configured with a new 5G-GUTI in step 2a over the 3GPP access, the UE passes the new 5G-GUTI to its 3GPP access' lower layers.\nNOTE 5:\tSteps 2c and 2d are needed because the NG-RAN may use the RRC_INACTIVE state and a part of the 5G-GUTI is used to calculate the Paging Frame (see TS 38.304 [44] and TS 36.304 [43]). It is assumed that the UE Configuration Update Complete is reliably delivered to the AMF after the 5G-AN has acknowledged its receipt to the UE.\n3a.\t[Conditional] If only NAS parameters that can be updated without transition from CM-IDLE are included (e.g. MICO mode, Enhanced Coverage Restricted information) the UE shall initiate a Registration procedure immediately after the acknowledgement to re-negotiate the updated NAS parameter(s) with the network. Steps 3b, 3c and step 4 are skipped.\n3b.\t[Conditional] If a new Allowed NSSAI and/or a new Mapping Of Allowed NSSAI and/or Partially Allowed NSSAI and/or Mapping Of Partially Allowed NSSAI and/or a new Configured NSSAI provided by the AMF to the UE in step 1 does not affect the existing connectivity to AMF, the AMF needs not release the NAS signalling connection for the UE after receiving the acknowledgement in step 2 and immediate registration is not required. The UE can start immediately using the new Allowed NSSAI and/or the new Mapping Of Allowed NSSAI and/or Partially Allowed NSSAI and/or Mapping Of Partially Allowed NSSAI. If one or more PDU Sessions use a S-NSSAI that is not part of the new Allowed NSSAI or Partially Allowed NSSAI, the AMF indicates to the SMF(s) the corresponding PDU Session ID(s) and each SMF releases the PDU Session(s) according to clause 4.3.4.2.

Steps 3c and 4 are skipped.\nThe AMF may, based on its policy, provide anyway an indication that a Registration procedure is required even though the UE Configuration Update Command in step 1 does not affect the existing connectivity to Network Slices: in such a case only step 3c is skipped.\n3c.\t[Conditional] If a new Allowed NSSAI and/or a new Mapping Of Allowed NSSAI and/or Partially Allowed NSSAI and/or Mapping Of Partially Allowed NSSAI and/or a new Configured NSSAI provided by the AMF to the UE in step 1 affects ongoing existing connectivity to AMF, then the AMF shall provide an indication that the UE shall initiate a Registration procedure.\n4.\t[Conditional] After receiving the acknowledgement in step 2, the AMF shall release the NAS signalling connection for the UE by triggering the AN Release procedure, unless there is one established PDU Sessions associated with regulatory prioritized services. If there is one established PDU Session associated with regulatory prioritized services, the AMF informs SMFs to release the PDU Session(s) associated with non regulatory prioritized services for this UE (see clause 4.3.4).\nThe AMF shall reject any NAS Message from the UE carrying PDU Session Establishment Request for a non-emergency PDU Session before the required Registration procedure has been successfully completed by the UE.\nThe UE initiates a Registration procedure (see clauses 4.2.2.2.2 and 4.13.3.1) with registration type Mobility Registration Update after the UE enters CM-IDLE state and shall not include the 5G-S-TMSI or GUAMI in Access Stratum signalling and shall include, subject to the conditions set out in clause 5.15.9 of TS 23.501 [2], a Requested NSSAI in access stratum signalling.

In the non-roaming case, the V-PCF is not involved and the role of the H-PCF is performed by the PCF. For the roaming scenarios, the V-PCF interacts with the AMF and the H-PCF interacts with the V-PCF.\nFor the purpose of URSP delivery via EPS, the delivery procedure of UE Policy Containers from the SMF+PGW-C to the UE is specified in clause 4.11.0a.2a.10.\nFigure 4.2.4.3-1: UE Configuration Update procedure for transparent UE Policy delivery\n0.\tPCF decides to update UE policy based on triggering conditions such as an initial registration, registration with 5GS when the UE moves from EPS to 5GS, or need for updating UE policy as follows:\n-\tFor the case of initial registration and registration with 5GS when the UE moves from EPS to 5GS, the PCF compares the list of PSIs included in the UE policy information in Npcf_UEPolicyControl_Create request and determines, as described in clause 6.1.2.2.2 of TS 23.503 [20], whether UE policy information have to be updated and be provided to the UE via the AMF using DL NAS TRANSPORT message; and\n-\tFor the network triggered UE policy update case (e.g. the change of UE location, the change of Subscribed S-NSSAIs as described in clause 6.1.2.2.2 of TS 23.503 [20]), the PCF checks the latest list of PSIs to decide which UE policies have to be sent to the UE.\nThe PCF checks if the size of the resulting UE policy information exceeds a predefined limit:\n-\tIf the size is under the limit, then UE policy information are included in a single Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation as described below.\n-\tIf the size exceeds the predefined limit, the PCF splits the UE policy information in smaller, logically independent UE policy information ensuring the size of each is under the predefined limit. Each UE policy information will be then sent in separated Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operations as described below.\nNOTE 1:\tNAS messages from AMF to UE do not exceed the maximum size limit allowed in NG-RAN (PDCP layer), so the predefined size limit in PCF is related to that limitation.\nNOTE 2:\tThe mechanism used to split the UE policy information is described in TS 29.507 [32].\n0a.\tIf the PCF has not subscribed to be notified by the AMF about the UE response to an update of UE policy information, the PCF subscribes to the AMF to be notified about the UE response to an update of UE policy information.\n1.\tPCF invokes Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation provided by the AMF. The message includes SUPI, UE Policy Container.\n2.\tIf the UE is registered and reachable by AMF in either 3GPP access or non-3GPP access, AMF shall transfers transparently the UE Policy container to the UE via the registered and reachable access.\nIf the UE is registered in both 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses and reachable on both access and served by the same AMF, the AMF transfers transparently the UE Policy container to the UE via one of the accesses based on the AMF local policy.\nIf the UE is not reachable by AMF over both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access, the AMF reports to the PCF that the UE Policy container could not be delivered to the UE using Namf_Communication_N1N2TransferFailureNotification as in the step 5 in clause 4.2.3.3.\nIf AMF decides to transfer transparently the UE Policy container to the UE via 3GPP access, e.g. the UE is registered and reachable by AMF in 3GPP access only, or if the UE is registered and reachable by AMF in both 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses served by the same AMF and the AMF decides to transfer transparently the UE Policy container to the UE via 3GPP access based on local policy and the UE is in CM-IDLE and reachable by AMF in 3GPP access, the AMF starts the paging procedure by sending a Paging message described in the step 4b of Network Triggered Service Request (in clause 4.2.3.3). Upon reception of paging request, the UE shall initiate the UE Triggered Service Request procedure (clause 4.2.3.2).\n3.\tIf the UE is in CM-CONNECTED over 3GPP access or non-3GPP access, the AMF transfers transparently the UE Policy container (UE policy information) received from the PCF to the UE.

The service-related entity may subscribe in UDM to receive notifications about UE Reachability or UE Reachability for SMS delivery events as defined in clause 4.15.3.\nNOTE 1:\tThis request for UE Reachability Notification is received in UDM using different interfaces/services depending on the service-related entity. For example, an SBI capable service-related entity can use the Nudm_EventExposure_Subscribe service while an SMS-GMSC using non-SBI interfaces triggers this procedure as described in TS 23.040 [7].\nThe UDM may retrieve from the UDR the list of NF IDs for Network Functions authorized by the HPLMN to request notifications on this UE's reachability.\nIf the entity is not authorized, the UDM may reject the request (e.g. if the requesting entity is recognized as being a valid entity, but not authorized for that subscriber) or discard it silently (e.g. if the requesting entity is not recognized). Appropriate O&M reports are generated.\n1b.\t[Conditional] The UDM stores the identity of the service-related entity.\nIn the case that the service-related entity is an SMS-GMSC using non-SBI interfaces, the UDM stores the SC address within the MWD list. Otherwise, if the service-related entity is an SBI capable service-related entity, the UDM stores the address of the SBI capable service-related entity in the form of a subscription to the Nudm_EventExposure service.\nIf the UE Reachability Notification Request is for SMS over NAS and no SMSF is registered for the target UE, steps 2 to 4 are skipped.\nOtherwise the UDM sets the URRP-AMF flag parameter and continues with step 2.\n1c.\t[Conditional] An NF (e.g. SMF) may subscribe event of UE reachability status change by using the Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe service operation.

      "content": "This procedure is used to release the logical NG-AP signalling connection for the UE between the (R)AN and the AMF and the associated N3 User Plane connections and (R)AN signalling connection between the UE and the (R)AN and the associated (R)AN resources.\nWhen the NG-AP signalling connection is lost due to (R)AN or AMF failure, the AN release is performed locally by the AMF or the (R)AN as described in the procedure flow below without using or relying on any of the signalling shown between (R)AN and AMF. The AN release causes all UP connections of the UE to be deactivated.\nThe initiation of AN release may be due to:\n-\t(R)AN-initiated with cause e.g. O&M Intervention, Unspecified Failure, (R)AN (e.g. Radio) Link Failure, User Inactivity, Inter-System Redirection, request for establishment of QoS Flow for IMS voice, Release due to UE generated signalling connection release, mobility restriction, Release Assistance Information (RAI) from the UE, UE using satellite access moved out of PLMN serving area, etc.; or\n-\tAMF-initiated with cause e.g. Unspecified Failure, etc.\nBoth (R)AN-initiated and AMF-initiated AN Release procedures are shown in Figure 4.2.6-1.\nIf Service Gap Control shall be applied for the UE (see clause 5.31.16 of TS 23.501 [2]) and the Service Gap timer is not already running, the Service Gap timer shall be started in AMF and UE when entering CM-IDLE, unless the connection was initiated after a paging of an MT event, or after a Registration procedure without Uplink data status or after a Registration procedure for regulatory prioritized services like Emergency services or exception reporting.\nFor this procedure, the impacted SMF and UPF are all under control of the PLMN serving the UE, e.g. in Home Routed roaming case the SMF and UPF in HPLMN are not involved.\nFigure 4.2.6-1: AN Release procedure\n1.\tIf there is some confirmed (R)AN conditions (e.g. Radio Link Failure) or for other (R)AN internal reason, the (R)AN may decide to initiate the UE context release in the (R)AN. In this case, the (R)AN sends an N2 UE Context Release Request (Cause, List of PDU Session ID(s) with active N3 user plane) message to the AMF. Cause indicates the reason for the release (e.g. AN Link Failure, O&M intervention, unspecified failure, etc.). The List of PDU Session ID(s) indicates the PDU Sessions served by (R)AN of the UE. If the (R)AN is NG-RAN, this step is described in clause 8.3.2 of TS 38.413 [10]. If the (R)AN is an N3IWF this step is described in clause 4.12.4.2.\nIf the reason for the release is the NG-RAN received an AS Release Assistance Indicator as defined in TS 36.331 [16], NG-RAN should not immediately release the RRC connection but instead send an N2 UE Context Release Request message to the AMF. If the AS RAI indicates only a single downlink transmission is expected then NG-RAN should only send the N2 UE Context Release Request after a single downlink NAS PDU or N3 data PDU has been transferred.\nIf N2 Context Release Request cause indicates the release is requested due to user inactivity or AS RAI then the AMF continues with the AN Release procedure unless the AMF is aware of pending MT traffic or signalling.\nIf N2 Context Release Request cause indicates the release is requested due to a UE using satellite access moved out of PLMN serving area, the AMF may deregister the UE as described in clause 4.2.2.3.3 before continuing with the AN Release procedure.\nIf N2 Context Release Request cause indicates the release is requested due to MBSR not authorized as described in clause 5.35A.4 of TS 23.501 [2], the AMF may deregister the MBSR as described in clause 4.2.2.3.3 before continuing with the AN Release procedure.\n2.\tAMF to (R)AN: If the AMF receives the N2 UE Context Release Request message or due to an internal AMF event, including the reception of Service Request or Registration Request to establish another NAS signalling connection still via (R)AN, the AMF sends an N2 UE Context Release Command (Cause) to the (R)AN. The Cause indicates either the Cause from (R)AN in step 1 or the Cause due to an AMF event. If the (R)AN is a NG-RAN this step is described in detail in clause 8.3.3 of TS 38.413 [10]. If the (R)AN is an N3IWF/TNGF/W-AGF this step is described in clauses 4.12.4.2 / 4.12a and in clause 7.2.5 of TS 23.316 [53] for W-5GAN access.\nIf the AMF receives Service Request or Registration Request to establish another NAS signalling connection still via (R)AN, after successfully authenticating the UE, the AMF releases the old NAS signalling connection and then continues the Service Request or Registration Request procedure.\n3.\t[Conditional] If the (R)AN connection (e.g. RRC connection or NWu connection) with the UE is not already released (step 1), either:\na)\tthe (R)AN requests the UE to release the (R)AN connection. Upon receiving (R)AN connection release confirmation from the UE, the (R)AN deletes the UE's context, or\nb)\tif the Cause in the N2 UE Context Release Command indicates that the UE has already locally released the RRC connection, the (R)AN locally releases the RRC connection.\n4.\tThe (R)AN confirms the N2 Release by returning an N2 UE Context Release Complete (List of PDU Session ID(s) with active N3 user plane, User Location Information, Age of Location Information) message to the AMF. The List of PDU Session ID(s) indicates the PDU Sessions served by (R)AN of the UE. The AMF stores always the latest UE Radio Capability information or NB-IoT specific UE Radio Access Capability Information received from the NG-RAN node received as described in TS 38.413 [10]. The N2 signalling connection between the AMF and the (R)AN for that UE is released. If the UE is served by an NG-eNB that supports WUS, then the NG-eNB should include the Information On Recommended Cells And RAN nodes For Paging; otherwise the (R)AN may provide the list of recommended cells / TAs / NG-RAN node identifiers for paging to the AMF.\nIf the PLMN has configured secondary RAT usage reporting, the NG-RAN node may provide RAN usage data Report.\nThis step shall be performed promptly after step 2, i.e. it shall not be delayed, for example, in situations where the UE does not acknowledge the RRC Connection Release.\nThe NG-RAN includes Paging Assistance Data for CE capable UE, if available, in the N2 UE Context Release Complete message. The AMF stores the received Paging Assistance Data for CE capable UE in the UE context for subsequent Paging procedure.\n5.\t[Conditional] AMF to SMF: For each of the PDU Sessions in the N2 UE Context Release Complete, the AMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request (PDU Session ID, PDU Session Deactivation, Cause, Operation Type, User Location Information, Age of Location Information, N2 SM Information (Secondary RAT usage data)). The Cause in step 5 is the same Cause in step 2. If List of PDU Session ID(s) with active N3 user plane is included in step 1b, the step 5 to 7 are performed before step 2. The Operation Type is set to \"UP deactivate\" to indicate deactivation of user plane resources for the PDU Session.\nFor PDU Sessions using Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation and if the UE has negotiated the use of extended Idle mode DRX, the AMF informs the SMF immediately that the UE is not reachable for downlink data. For PDU Sessions using Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation and if the UE has negotiated the use of MICO mode with Active Time, the AMF informs the SMF that the UE is not reachable for downlink data once the Active Time has expired.\n6a\t[Conditional] SMF to UPF: N4 Session Modification Request (AN or N3 UPF Tunnel Info to be removed, Buffering on/off).\nFor PDU Sessions not using Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation, the SMF initiates an N4 Session Modification procedure indicating the need to remove Tunnel Info of AN or UPF terminating N3. Buffering on/off indicates whether the UPF shall buffer incoming DL PDU or not.\nIf the SMF has received an indication from the AMF that the UE is not reachable for downlink data for PDU Sessions using Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation, the SMF may initiate an N4 Session Modification procedure to activate buffering in the UPF.\nIf multiple UPFs are used in the PDU Session and the SMF determines to release the UPF terminating N3, step 6a is performed towards the UPF (e.g. PSA) terminating N9 towards the current N3 UPF. The SMF then releases the N4 session towards the N3 UPF (the N4 release is not shown on the call flow).\nSee clause 4.4 for more details.\nIf the cause of AN Release is because of User Inactivity, or UE Redirection, the SMF shall preserve the GBR QoS Flows.

      "content": "This clause applies to Non-Hierarchical and centralized NSAC architectures. The difference between the two architectures for the various steps, where applicable, is described at the end of the clause.\nThe number of UEs per network slice availability check and update procedure is to update (i.e. increase or decrease) the number of UEs registered with an S-NSSAI which is subject to NSAC. The AMF is configured with the information indicating which network slice is subject to NSAC.\nFigure 4.2.11.2-1: Number of UEs per network slice availability check and update procedure\n1.\tIf the AMF is not aware of which NSACF to communicate, the AMF performs NSACF discovery as described in clause 6.3.22 of TS 23.501 [2] and in clause 5.2.7.3.2. The AMF triggers the Number of UEs per network slice availability check and update procedure to update the number of UEs registered with a network slice when a network slice subject to NSAC is included in the Allowed NSSAI or Partially Allowed NSSAI (i.e. the AMF requests to register the UE with the S-NSSAI) or removed from the Allowed NSSAI or Partially Allowed NSSAI (i.e. the AMF requests to de-register the UE from the S-NSSAI) for a UE. The trigger event at the AMF also includes the change of Allowed NSSAI or Partially Allowed NSSAI in the case of inter-AMF mobility. The procedure is triggered in the following cases:\n-\tAt UE Registration procedure, according to clause 4.2.2.2.2 (including Registration types of Initial Registration or Mobility Registration Update in inter-AMF mobility in CM-CONNECTED or CM-IDLE state):\n-\tbefore the Registration Accept in step 21 if the EAC mode is active; or\n-\tafter the Registration Accept message if the EAC mode is not active;\n-\tAt UE Deregistration procedure, as per clause 4.2.2.3, after the Deregistration procedure is completed;\n-\tAt UE Configuration Update procedure (which may result from NSSAA procedure or subscribed S-NSSAI change):\n-\tbefore the UE Configuration Update message if the EAC mode is active and the update flag is to increase; or\n-\tafter the UE Configuration Update message if the EAC mode is active and the update flag is to decrease; or\n-\tafter the UE Configuration Update message if the EAC mode is not active.\nNOTE 1:\tDepending on the deployment, there may be different NSACF for different S-NSSAI subject to NSAC and hence, during the registration, AMF triggers the Number of UEs per network slice availability check and update procedure to multiple NSACFs.\n2.\tThe AMF sends Nnsacf_NSAC_NumOfUEsUpdate_Request message to the NSACF. The AMF includes in the message the UE ID, Access Type to which the Allowed NSSAI or Partially Allowed NSSAI is applied, the S-NSSAI(s), the NF ID and the update flag which indicates whether the number of UEs registered with the S-NSSAI(s) is to be increased when the UE has gained registration to network slice(s) subject to NSAC or the number of UEs registered with the S-NSSAI(s) is to be decreased when the UE has deregistered from S-NSSAI(s) or could not renew its registration to an S-NSSAI subject to NSAC.\nIf this is the first time to perform NSAC procedure for the S-NSSAI towards the NSACF, the AMF includes notification endpoint for EAC Notification to implicitly subscribe the EAC notification for the S-NSSAI from the NSACF.\n3.\tThe NSACF determines whether the Access Type provided by the AMF is configured for the NSAC based on its configuration. If the Access Type is not configured for the NSAC, the NSACF always accepts the request from the AMF without increasing or decreasing the number of UEs. If the Access Type is configured for the NSAC, the NSACF updates the current number of UEs registered for the S-NSSAI, i.e. increases or decrease the number of UEs registered per network slice based on the information provided by the AMF in the update flag parameter.\nIf the update flag parameter from the AMF indicates increase, the following applies:\n-\tIf the UE ID is already in the list of UEs registered with the network slice, the current number of UEs is not increased as the UE has already been counted as registered with the network slice. The NSACF creates a new entry associated with this new update and shall also maintain the old entry associated with previous update. The multiple entries for the same UE ID in the NSACF are differentiated based on the NF ID of the NF sending the update request. The NSACF removes the entry associated with the NF ID upon reception of a request having update flag indicating decrease.\nNOTE 2:\tThe use case of having two or more entries in the NSACF for the same UE can happen during (a) inter-AMF mobility when the new AMF request update to the NSACF before the old AMF sends request to deregister the UE; or (b) PDN connections establishment in the EPC when multiple SMF +PGW-Cs (i.e. used for different PDN Connections associated with the same S-NSSAI) send update requests for maximum number of UEs to the NSACF.\nNOTE 3:\tTo handle AMF graceful removal, the NSACF can subscribe for unavailability notifications with the AMF (directly or via NRF) as described in clause 5.21.2.2 and act accordingly, e.g. update the NF ID with the target AMF ID.\n-\tIf the UE ID is not in the list of UE IDs registered with the network slice and the maximum number of UEs registered with the network slice has not been reached yet, the NSACF adds the UE ID in the list of UEs registered with the network slice as a new entry associated with this new update and increases the current number of the UEs registered with the network slice. If the UE ID is not in the list of UEs registered with that S-NSSAI and the maximum number of UEs for that S-NSSAI has already been reached, then the NSACF returns a result parameter indicating that the maximum number of UEs registered with the network slice has been reached.\nIf the update flag parameter from the AMF indicates decrease and if there is only one entry associated with the UE ID, the NSACF removes the UE ID from the list of UEs registered with the network slice for each of the S-NSSAI(s) indicated in the request from the AMF and also the NSACF decreases the number of UEs per network slice that is maintained by the NSACF for each of these network slices. If there are multiple entries associated with the UE ID, the NSACF removes the entry associated with the NF ID but the UE ID is kept in the list of UEs registered with the S-NSSAI.\nThe NSACF takes access type into account for increasing and decreasing the number of UEs per network slice as described in clause 5.15.11.1 of TS 23.501 [2].\nThe NSACF stores the notification endpoint for EAC Notification associated with the S-NSSAI if it is received from the AMF. The NSACF can use this AMF notification endpoint to update the EAC mode as described in clause 4.2.11.3.\nNOTE 4:\tThis enables the NSACF to maintain up-to-date information about the AMFs serving the S-NSSAIs.\n4.\tThe NSACF returns the Nnsacf_NSAC_NumOfUEsUpdate_Response message including Result indication per S-NSSAI. The Result indication includes either 'maximum number of UEs registered with the network slice reached' or 'maximum number of UEs registered with the network slice not reached'.\nAt UE Registration procedure, if only some of the S-NSSAIs reached the maximum number of UEs per S-NSSAI, the AMF sends a Registration Accept message to the UE in which the AMF includes the rejected S-NSSAI(s) in the rejected NSSAI list for which the NSACF has indicated that the maximum number of UEs per network slice has been reached and for each rejected S-NSSAI the AMF includes a reject cause set to 'maximum number of UEs per network slice reached' and optionally a back-off timer.\nWhen for all the Requested S-NSSAI(s) provided in step 2 the NSACF returned the maximum number of UEs per network slice has been reached and if one or more subscribed S-NSSAIs are marked as default in the subscription data and not subject to NSAC, the AMF can decide to include these Default Subscribed S-NSSAIs in the Allowed NSSAI. Otherwise, the AMF rejects the UE request for registration. In the Registration Reject message, the AMF includes the rejected S-NSSAI(s) in the rejected NSSAI parameter and for each rejected S-NSSAI the AMF includes a reject cause to indicate that the maximum number of UEs per network slice has been reached and optionally a back-off timer.\nNOTE 5:\tIf the use case requires the UE to remain reachable at all times with at least one slice, it is recommended that at least one of the Subscribed S-NSSAIs is marked as the default S-NSSAI which is not subject to NSAC. This will ensure the UE is able to access to services even when maximum number of UEs per network slice has been reached.\nFor a centralized architecture the following differences apply:\n-\tIn step 2, the AMF additionally includes the NSAC service area the AMF belongs to, if available, as an additional parameter in the Nnsacf_NSAC_NumOfUEsUpdate_Request.\n-\tIn step 3, based on operator configuration, the NSACF performs the validation against the maximum number of Registered UEs registered per NSAC service area defined for the network slice if applicable and available, or the maximum number of Registered UEs in the entire PLMN for the network slice. Additionally the NSACF stores the NSAC service area of AMF if available.\nNOTE 6:\tWhen a centralized NSAC architecture is deployed, NSACF does not perform any readmission at inter-AMF mobility since the UE is already admitted if the validation of maximum number of Registered UEs against the entire PLMN.\n4.2.11.2a\tHierarchical NSACF-based number of UEs per network slice availability check and update procedure\nFigure 4.2.11.2a-1: Hierarchical NSACF-based number of UEs per network slice availability check and update procedure\nFor an S-NSSAIs subject to counting of the number of registered UEs, if hierarchical NSACF architecture is deployed in the network the enforcement of maximum number of UEs registered for an S-NSSAI is performed as follows:\n1.\tSame as the step 1 defined in clause 4.2.11.2.\n2.\tIn addition to the information included in the Nnsacf_NSAC_NumOfUEsUpdate_Request as described in the step 2 of clause 4.2.11.2, the AMF may provide UE already registered indication to the NSACF if the UE has been registered with the S-NSSAI in another NSAC service area before. The AMF determines the indication based on the received Allowed NSSAI information from the source AMF (in case of inter AMF handover) or from SMF+PGW-C (in case of mobility from EPS to 5GS).\n3.\tThe NSACF performs NSAC for the indicated S-NSSAI.\nIf the update flag parameter from the AMF indicates increase, the following applies:\n-\tFor NSACF which support UE admission quota based control:\n-\tIf the local maximum number of UEs is not reached yet, the NSACF executes the same action as specified in the step 3 in clause 4.2.11.2. The steps 4-8 are skipped.\n-\tIf the local maximum number of UEs is reached, the NSACF sends a delegation request to the Primary NSACF. Steps 4-9 are executed.\n-\tFor NSACF which supports UE admission threshold-based control, as defined in clause 5.15.11.1.2 of TS 23.501 [2]:\n-\tIf the UE admission is below the threshold level, the NSACF executes the same action as the step 3 defined in clause 4.2.11.2. Steps 4-8 are skipped.\n-\tIf the UE admission is at or above the threshold level and the local maximum number of UEs has not been reached, the NSACF checks whether the UE already registered indication is present.\n-\tIf the UE already registered indication is not present then the NSACF immediately rejects the NSAC request. Steps 4-8 are skipped.\n-\tIf the UE already registered indication is present the NSACF executes the same action as the step 3 defined in clause 4.2.11.2 in order to allow for service continuity. Steps 4-8 are skipped.\n-\tIf the local maximum number has been reached and the UE already registered indication is present then the NSACF sends a delegation request of NSAC to the Primary NSACF in order to allow for service continuity. Steps 4-9 are executed.\nIf the update flag parameter from the AMF indicates decrease, the following applies:\n-\tIf the UE entry to be deleted is stored at the NSACF, the NSACF executes the same action as the step 3 defined in clause 4.2.11.2. Steps 4-8 are skipped.\n-\tIf the UE entry to be deleted is not stored at the NSACF, the NSACF sends a delegation request of NSAC to the Primary NSACF. Steps 4-9 are executed.\n4.\tIf the Primary NSACF has not been discovered before, the NSACF discovers and selects the Primary NSACF which manages the entire PLMN NSAC service area according to clause 6.3.22 of TS 23.501 [2].\n5.\tThe NSACF invokes Nnsacf_NSAC_NumOfUEsUpdate_Request service operation to the Primary NSACF. The request includes the NSAC request information received from AMF, which may include the UE already Registered indication only if it is received from AMF and the UE admission type is quota-based.\n6.\tThe Primary NSACF performs NSAC for the indicated S-NSSAI.\nIf the update flag parameter from the NSACF indicates increase, the following applies:\n-\tIf the Primary NSACF decided to delegate the NSAC update request to the NSACF, per the applied UE admission type of the network, the Primary NSACF adjusts the local maximum number for UE quota-based admission or the UE admission threshold for UE admission-threshold in its response to the NSACF. The Primary NSACF does not create a new entry associated with the UE ID in the received NSAC request.\nNOTE 1:\tWhen NSACF sends a delegation request to the Primary NSACF, the Primary NSACF either increases local maximum number at NSACF or rejects the NSAC request.\n-\tFor quota-based admission type and if the Primary NSACF decided not to delegate the request to the NSACF and the UE already Registered indication is not included, the Primary NSACF rejects the NSAC request. If the UE already Registered indication is included and if the Primary NSACF decided to store the UE entry, it creates a new entry associated with the UE ID within the received NSAC. If the Primary NSACF is not able to store the UE entry, the Primary NSACF rejects the request. The Primary NSACF respond accordingly the NSACF as in step 7.\n-\tFor threshold-based admission and if the Primary NSACF decided not to delegate the request to the NSACF, the same action as for step 3 in clause 4.2.11.2 is executed with the replacement of NSACF with Primary NSACF.\nNOTE 2:\tTo support the session continuity across different NSAC service area, the Primary NSACF always reserves part of the global maximum number for its own use, i.e. the whole global maximum number is not distributed to all contacted NSACF(s).\nIf the update flag parameter from the NSACF indicates decrease and the UE entry is managed by the Primary NSACF, the same action as step 3 in clause 4.2.11.2 is executed with the replacement of NSACF with Primary NSAC. This applies to both admission types.\n7.\tThe Primary NSACF returns the Nnsacf_NSAC_NumOfUEsUpdate_Response message to the NSACF. The response may include the Result indication as described in step 4 in clause 4.2.11.2.\nIf the Primary NSACF determines to adjust the configured value stored at the NSACF, the updated local maximum number of UEs or UE admission threshold is also included in the response respectively.\n8.\tThe NSACF checks the response from Primary NSACF.\nIf the response includes the updated configured value,\n-\tThe NSACF, which supports UE admission quota based control, replaces the existing local maximum number of UEs with the received updated value. The same action is executed as for step 3 in clause 4.2.11.2 based on the updated configured value.\n-\tThe NSACF, which supports UE admission threshold based control, replaces the existing UE admission threshold with the received updated value. The same action is executed as for step 3 in clause 4.2.11.2 based on the updated configured value.\nIf the response does not include the updated configured value, the NSACF returns the response to AMF based on the received NSAC response from Primary NSACF.\n9.\tSame as for step 4 defined in clause 4.2.11.2.",

      "content": "The configuration for Early Admission Control (EAC) update procedure indicates to the AMF the activation or the deactivation of the EAC mode for the S-NSSAI subject to NSAC. EAC mode means that the AMF is required to perform the number of UEs per network slice availability check and update procedure before the S-NSSAI subject to NSAC is included in the Allowed NSSAI or Partially Allowed NSSAI and sent to the UE. EAC mode is only applicable in the AMF when the update flag is set to increase.\nThe AMF implicitly subscribes to the EAC notification for the S-NSSAI when it performs the first network slice availability check and update procedure for the S-NSSAI with the NSACF. The NSACF sends the EAC mode notification towards all notification endpoints associated with the S-NSSAI.\nFigure 4.2.11.3-1: Early Admission Control (EAC) update procedure\n1.\tThe number of UEs registered with a network slice subject to NSAC crosses a certain operator defined threshold.

      "content": "This clause applies to Non-Hierarchical NSAC and centralized NSAC architectures. The difference between the two architectures for the various steps, where applicable, is described at the end of the clause.\nThe number of PDU Sessions per network slice availability check and update procedure is to update (i.e. increase or decrease) the number of PDU Sessions established on S-NSSAI which is subject to NSAC. The SMF is configured with the information indicating which network slice is subject to NSAC.\nNOTE 1:\tEAC mode is not applicable for Number of PDU Sessions per network slice availability check and update procedure.\nFigure 4.2.11.4-1: Number of PDU Sessions per network slice availability check and update procedure\n1.\tIf the SMF is not aware of which NSACF to communicate, the SMF performs NSACF discovery as described in clause 6.3.22 of TS 23.501 [2] and in clause 5.2.7.3.2. The SMF anchoring the PDU session triggers the Number of PDU Sessions per network slice availability check and update procedure for the network slices that are subject to NSAC at the beginning of a PDU Session Establishment procedure (clause 4.3.2.2.1 and clause 4.3.2.2.2) only for new PDU Sessions to be established and as a last step of successful PDU Session Release procedure (clause 4.3.4.2 and clause 4.3.4.3).\nNOTE 2:\tSMFs handling PDU sessions associated with UE Request Type \"Existing PDU Session\" for intra access handover purposes do not interact with the NSACF.\n2.\tThe SMF anchoring the PDU session sends Nnsacf_NSAC_NumOfPDUsUpdate_Request message to the NSACF. The SMF includes in the message the UE-ID, the PDU session ID, S-NSSAI for which the number of PDU Sessions per network slice update is required, Access Type and the update flag. The update flag may include one of the following values:\n-\t'increase' which indicates that the number of PDUs established on the S-NSSAI is to be increased when the procedure is triggered at the beginning of PDU Session Establishment procedure or when a new user plane leg is to be established for an MA PDU Session;\n-\t'decrease' which indicates that the number of PDU Sessions on the S-NSSAI is to be decreased when the procedure is triggered at the end of PDU Sessions Release procedure or when an existing user plane leg is to be released for an MA PDU Session. In the case of a PDU Session Establishment failure, the anchor SMF triggers another request to the NSACF with the update flag parameter equal to decrease in order to re-adjust back the PDU Session counter in the NSACF; or\n-\t'update' which indicates that for existing PDU Session the Access Type is to be replaced with a new Access Type during inter access mobility.\nNOTE 3:\tFor SSC mode 3 PDU session, the SMF of the new PDU Session invokes the NSACF to increase the number of PDU Session and adds the new PDU session ID in the NSACF. When the old PDU session is released the SMF of the old PDU session invokes the NSACF to decrease the number of PDU Session and remove the old PDU session ID in the NSACF.\nNOTE 4:\tAn SMF anchoring an IPv6 Multi-homed PDU session does not invoke NSACF for an S-NSSAI subject to NSAC when the PDU session replaces an existing anchor according to clause 4.3.5.3.\n3.\tThe NSACF updates the current number of PDU Sessions established on the S-NSSAI, i.e. increase or decrease the number of PDU Sessions per network slice based on the information provided by the anchor SMF in the update flag parameter.\nIf the update flag parameter from the SMF anchoring the PDU session indicates increase value and the maximum number of PDU Sessions established on the S-NSSAI has already been reached, then the NSACF returns a result parameter indicating that the maximum number of PDU Sessions per network slice has been reached. If the maximum number of PDU Sessions established on the S-NSSAI has not been reached, the NSACF checks the UE ID. If the UE ID is located, the NSACF, stores the PDU Session ID and the Access Type and increases the number of PDU Sessions for that S-NSSAI. If the NSACF did not locate the UE ID, it creates an entry for the UE ID, stores the PDU Session ID and Access Type and increases the number of PDU Sessions for that S-NSSAI.\nIf the update flag parameter from the SMF anchoring the PDU session indicates decrease value, the current number of PDU Sessions per S-NSSAI, the NSACF locates the UE ID and decreases the number of PDU Sessions for that S-NSSAI and removes the related PDU Session ID entry. If the UE ID has no more PDU sessions, after the decrease, the NSACF removes the UE ID entry.\nIf the update flag parameter from the SMF anchoring the PDU session indicates update value, the NSACF locates the existing entry with UE ID and PDU Session ID and replaces the Access Type in the existing entry.\nThe NSACF takes the Access Type parameter into account for increasing and decreasing the number of PDU Sessions per S-NSSAI as described in clause 5.15.11.2 of TS 23.501 [2]. For MA PDU Session, if the SMF received information that the UE is registered over both accesses, the SMF provides multiple Access Types to the NSACF. If the NSACF receives a request containing multiple Access Types, the NSACF provides a Result indication for each Access Type.\n4.\tThe NSACF acknowledges the update to the anchor SMF with Nnsacf_NSAC_NumOfPDUsUpdate_Response message including a Result indication. If the NSACF returns a Result indication including 'maximum number of PDU Sessions per S-NSSAI reached', the SMF rejects the PDU Session establishment request with reject cause set to 'maximum number of PDU Sessions per S-NSSAI reached' and optionally a back-off timer and the Access Type.\nFor MA PDU Session Establishment, the NSACF may accept the MA PDU Session and may provide to the SMF a Result indicating 'maximum number of PDU Sessions per S-NSSAI reached' or 'maximum number of PDU Sessions per S-NSSAI not reached' associated with an Access Type. If the NSACF indicates a failure that is associated with the Access Type over which the UE sent the MA PDU Session Establishment Request, the SMF sends to the UE a PDU Session Establishment Reject with a Result indication including 'maximum number of PDU Sessions per S-NSSAI reached' ,optionally a back-off timer and the Access Type. When the SMF rejects the MA PDU Session, the SMF sets the Access Type parameter as follows:\n-\tIf the UE is registered via both accesses and:\n-\tIf the NSACF indicates failure for both accesses, the Access Type indicates both accesses;\n-\tIf the NSACF indicates failure for the access over which the MA PDU Session Establishment Request is received, the Access Type indicates the access over which the MA PDU Session Request is received.\nNOTE 5:\tIf the UE is registered in both accesses and the NSACF indicates failure for the access different from the access over which the MA PDU Session Establishment Request is received, the SMF accepts the MA PDU Session Request and does not provide back-off timer to the UE.\n-\tIf the UE is registered via a single access, the Access Type indicates the access over which the MA PDU Session Request is received.\n-\tFor MA PDU Session Release over single Access Type, the NSACF locates the existing entry with PDU Session ID and if founds the entry with both Access Type then it removes only the received Access Type entry while keeping the PDU Session ID.\nFor a centralized architecture the following differences apply:\n-\tIn step 2, the SMF additionally includes the NSAC service area the SMF belongs to, if available, as an additional parameter in the Nnsacf_NSAC_NumOfPDUsUpdate_Request.\n-\tIn step 3, based on operator configuration, the NSACF performs the validation against the maximum number of PDU Sessions established on the S-NSSAI per NSAC service area, if applicable and available, or maximum number of PDU Sessions established on the S-NSSAI in the entire PLMN. Additionally the NSACF stores the NSAC service area of SMF if available.\n4.2.11.4a\tHierarchical NSACF-based Number of PDU Sessions per network slice availability check and update procedure\nFigure 4.2.11.4a-1: Hierarchical NSAC-based number of PDU Sessions per network slice availability check and update procedure\nFor an S-NSSAI subject to counting of the number of PDU sessions, if hierarchical NSACF architecture is deployed in the network the enforcement of maximum number of PDU Session established for an S-NSSAI is performed as follow:\n1-2.\tSame as for steps 1-2 defined in clause 4.2.11.4.\n3.\tThe NSACF performs NSAC for the indicated S-NSSAI.\nIf the PDU session ID entry update at the NSACF is possible, e.g. create a new entry associated with the received NSAC request for increase case, the same action as for step 3 defined in clause 4.2.11.4 is executed. Steps 4-8 are skipped.\nIf the PDU session ID entry at the NSACF is not possible, i.e. by admitting the PDU session the local maximum PDU session number is exceeded, the NSACF delegates the request to the Primary NSACF for an updated local maximum PDU sessions from the Primary NSACF.\n4.\tIf the Primary NSACF has not been discovered before, the NSACF discovers and selects the Primary NSACF, which manages the global NSAC service area as for clause 6.3.22 of TS 23.501 [2].\n5.\tThe NSACF invokes Nnsacf_NSAC_NumOfPDUsUpdate request to the Primary NSACF. The request message includes the S-NSSAI.\n6.\tThe Primary NSACF checks the global maximum PDU session number and determines whether to accept or reject the request to update local maximum PDU session number from NSACF.\nNOTE:\tWhen NSACF sends a delegation request to the Primary NSACF, the Primary NSACF either increases local maximum number at NSACF or rejects the NSAC request.\n7.\tThe Primary NSACF returns the Nnsacf_NSAC_NumOfPDUsUpdate response. The response includes a new allocated local maximum PDU sessions number or an indication to reject the request to update local maximum PDU session number.\n8.\tIf the primary NSACF provides an updated local maximum number, the NSACF replaces the local maximum PDU session number with the received local maximum PDU sessions number value. The same action is executed as for step 3 in clause 4.2.11.4 based on the updated configured value.\n9.\tSame as for step 4 of clause 4.2.11.4.",

      "content": "Clause 4.3.2.2.1 specifies PDU Session establishment in the non-roaming and roaming with local breakout cases. The procedure is used to:\n-\tEstablish a new PDU Session;\n-\tHandover a PDN Connection in EPS to PDU Session in 5GS without N26 interface;\n-\tSwitching an existing PDU Session between non-3GPP access and 3GPP access. The specific system behaviour in this case is further defined in clauses 4.9.2 and 4.9.3; or\n-\tRequest a PDU Session for Emergency services.\nIn the case of roaming, the AMF determines if a PDU Session is to be established in LBO or Home Routing. In the case of LBO, the procedure is as in the case of non-roaming with the difference that the AMF, the SMF, the UPF and the PCF are located in the visited network. PDU Sessions for Emergency services are never established in Home Routed mode. If Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation is enabled for the PDU session with LBO, the NEF is not used as the anchor of this PDU Session.\nNOTE 1:\tUE provides both the S-NSSAIs of the Home PLMN and Visited PLMN to the network as described in clause 5.15.5.3 of TS 23.501 [2].\nFigure 4.3.2.2.1-1: UE-requested PDU Session Establishment for non-roaming and roaming with local breakout\nThe procedure assumes that the UE has already registered on the AMF thus unless the UE is Emergency Registered the AMF has already retrieved the user subscription data from the UDM.\n1.\tFrom UE to AMF: NAS Message (S-NSSAI(s), [Alternative S-NSSAI], UE Requested DNN, PDU Session ID, Request type, Old PDU Session ID, N1 SM container (PDU Session Establishment Request, [Port Management Information Container])).\nIn order to establish a new PDU Session, the UE generates a new PDU Session ID.\nThe UE initiates the UE Requested PDU Session Establishment procedure by the transmission of a NAS message containing a PDU Session Establishment Request within the N1 SM container. The PDU Session Establishment Request includes a PDU session ID, Requested PDU Session Type, a Requested SSC mode, 5GSM Capability, PCO, SM PDU DN Request Container, [Number Of Packet Filters], [Header Compression Configuration], UE Integrity Protection Maximum Data Rate, [Always-on PDU Session Requested], [RSN], [URSP rule enforcement reports] and [PDU Session Pair ID].\nThe Request Type indicates \"Initial request\" if the PDU Session Establishment is a request to establish a new PDU Session and indicates \"Existing PDU Session\" if the request refers to an existing PDU Session switching between 3GPP access and non-3GPP access or to a PDU Session handover from an existing PDN connection in EPC. If the request refers to an existing PDN connection in EPC, the S-NSSAI is set as described in clause 5.15.7.2 of TS 23.501 [2]\nWhen Emergency service is required and an Emergency PDU Session is not already established, a UE shall initiate the UE Requested PDU Session Establishment procedure with a Request Type indicating \"Emergency Request\".\nThe Request Type indicates \"Emergency Request\" if the PDU Session Establishment is a request to establish a PDU Session for Emergency services. The Request Type indicates \"Existing Emergency PDU Session\" if the request refers to an existing PDU Session for Emergency services switching between 3GPP access and non-3GPP access or to a PDU Session handover from an existing PDN connection for Emergency services in EPC.\nThe 5GSM Core Network Capability is provided by the UE and handled by SMF as defined in clause 5.4.4b of TS 23.501 [2].\nThe Number Of Packet Filters indicates the number of supported packet filters for signalled QoS rules for the PDU Session that is being established. The number of packet filters indicated by the UE is valid for the lifetime of the PDU Session. For presence condition, see TS 24.501 [25].\nThe UE Integrity Protection Maximum Data Rate indicates the maximum data rate up to which the UE can support UP integrity protection. The UE shall provide the UE Integrity Protection Data Rate capability independently of the Access Type over which the UE sends the PDU Session Establishment Request.\nIf the use of header compression for Control Plane CIoT 5GS optimisation was negotiated successfully between the UE and the network in the previous registration procedure, the UE shall include the Header Compression Configuration, unless \"Unstructured\" PDU Session Type is indicated. The Header Compression Configuration includes the information necessary for the header compression channel setup. Optionally, the Header Compression Configuration may include additional header compression context parameters.\nThe NAS message sent by the UE is encapsulated by the AN in a N2 message towards the AMF that should include User location information and Access Type Information.\nThe PDU Session Establishment Request message may contain SM PDU DN Request Container containing information for the PDU Session authorization by the external DN.\nThe UE includes the S-NSSAI from the Allowed NSSAI of the current access type or Partially Allowed NSSAI. If the UE is provided with the mapping of an S-NSSAI that is replaced by an Alternative S-NSSAI, the UE shall provide both the Alternative S-NSSAI and the S-NSSAI that is replaced by it. If the Mapping of Allowed NSSAI or Mapping Of Partially Allowed NSSAI was provided to the UE, the UE shall provide both the S-NSSAI of the VPLMN from the Allowed NSSAI or Partially Allowed NSSAI and the corresponding S-NSSAI of the HPLMN from the Mapping Of Allowed NSSAI or Mapping Of Partially Allowed NSSAI. If the UE is provided with the mapping of the VPLMN S-NSSAI to a VPLMN Alternative S-NSSAI, the UE provides both the VPLMN Alternative S-NSSAI and the VPLMN S-NSSAI in the PDU Session Establishment message. If the UE is provided with the mapping of the HPLMN S-NSSAI to a HPLMN Alternative S-NSSAI, the UE provides both the HPLMN Alternative S-NSSAI and the HPLMN S-NSSAI in the PDU Session Establishment message. The AMF verifies whether the Alternative S-NSSAI and the S-NSSAI provided in the PDU Session Establishment Request message is valid based on the UE context as described in clause 5.15.19 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf the procedure is triggered for SSC mode 3 operation, the UE shall also include the Old PDU Session ID which indicates the PDU Session ID of the on-going PDU Session to be released, in NAS message. The Old PDU Session ID is included only in this case.\nThe AMF receives from the AN the NAS SM message (built in step 1) together with User Location Information (e.g. Cell Id in the case of the NG-RAN).\nThe UE shall not trigger a PDU Session establishment for a PDU Session corresponding to a LADN when the UE is outside the area of availability of the LADN.\nThe UE shall not trigger a PDU Session establishment for a PDU Session associated to an S-NSSAI if the S-NSSAI is not valid as per the S-NSSAI location availability information.\nIf the UE is establishing a PDU session for IMS and the UE is configured to discover the P-CSCF address during connectivity establishment, the UE shall include an indicator that it requests a P‑CSCF IP address(es) within the SM container.\nThe PS Data Off status is included in the PCO in the PDU Session Establishment Request message.\nThe UE capability to support Reliable Data Service is included in the PCO in the PDU Session Establishment Request message.\nIf the UE has indicated that it supports transfer of Port Management Information Containers as per UE 5GSM Core Network Capability and if the PDU session type is Ethernet, then the UE shall include the MAC address of the DS-TT Ethernet port used for this Ethernet PDU session. If the UE is aware of the UE-DS-TT Residence Time, then the UE shall additionally include the UE-DS-TT Residence Time.\nIf the UE requests to establish always-on PDU session, the UE includes an Always-on PDU Session Requested indication in the PDU Session Establishment Request message.\nAs described in TS 23.548 [74], a UE that hosts EEC(s) may indicate in the PCO that it supports the ability to receive ECS address(es) via NAS and to transfer the ECS Address(es) to the EEC(s).\nA UE that hosts the EDC functionality shall indicate in the PCO its capability to support the EDC functionality (see clause 5.2.1 of TS 23.548 [74]).\nThe UE may also include PDU Session Pair ID and/or RSN in PDU Session Establishment Request message as described in clause 5.33.2.1 of TS 23.501 [2].\nA UE that supports EAS re-discovery as described in clause 6.2.3.3 of TS 23.548 [74], may indicate so in the PCO.\nPort Management Information Container may be received from DS-TT and includes port management capabilities, i.e. information indicating which standardized and deployment-specific port management information is supported by DS-TT as defined in clause 5.28.3 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf UE supports to report URSP rule enforcement to network and the URSP rule that triggered this PDU Session Establishment Request included the Indication for reporting URSP rule enforcement, the UE may provide URSP rule enforcement report as described in clause 6.6.2.4 of TS 23.503 [20].\n2.\tFor NR satellite access, the AMF may decide to verify the UE location as described in clause 5.4.11.4 of TS 23.501 [2].\nThe AMF determines that the message corresponds to a request for a new PDU Session based on that Request Type indicates \"initial request\" and that the PDU Session ID is not used for any existing PDU Session of the UE. If the NAS message does not contain an S-NSSAI, the AMF determines an S-NSSAI of the Serving PLMN for the requested PDU Session from the current Allowed NSSAI for the UE. If there is only one S-NSSAI in the Allowed NSSAI, this S-NSSAI shall be used. If there is more than one S-NSSAI in the Allowed NSSAI, the S-NSSAI selected is either according to the UE subscription, if the subscription contains only one default S-NSSAI and the corresponding mapped HPLMN S-NSSAI of the Serving PLMN is included in the Allowed NSSAI, or based on operator policy (e.g. also ensures any UE Requested DNN is allowed for the selected S-NSSAI)). When the NAS Message does not contain a DNN, the AMF determines the DNN for the requested PDU Session by selecting the default DNN for the S-NSSAI (irrespective of whether the S-NSSAI is included in the NAS message or determined by the AMF) if the default DNN is present in the UE's Subscription Information (or for the corresponding S-NSSAI of the HPLMN, in the case of LBO); otherwise the serving AMF selects a locally configured DNN for this S-NSSAI of the Serving PLMN. If the AMF cannot select an SMF (e.g. the UE requested DNN is not supported by the network, or the UE requested DNN is not in the Subscribed DNN List for the S-NSSAI (or its mapped value for the HPLMN in the case of LBO) and wildcard DNN is not included in the Subscribed DNN list), the AMF shall, based on operator policies received from PCF, either reject the NAS Message containing PDU Session Establishment Request from the UE with an appropriate cause or request PCF to replace the UE requested DNN by a selected DNN. If the DNN requested by the UE is present in the UE subscription information but indicated for replacement in the operator policies received from PCF, the AMF shall request the PCF to perform a DNN replacement to a selected DNN. AMF requests DNN replacement as specified in clause 4.16.2.1.1. If the DNN requested by the UE is present in the UE subscription information but not supported by the network and not indicated for replacement in the operator policies received from PCF, the AMF shall reject the NAS Message containing PDU Session Establishment Request from the UE with an appropriate cause value.\nThe AMF selects an SMF as described in clause 6.3.2 of TS 23.501 [2] and clause 4.3.2.2.3. If the Request Type indicates \"Initial request\" or the request is due to handover from EPS or from non-3GPP access serving by a different AMF, the AMF stores an association of the S-NSSAI(s), the DNN, the PDU Session ID, the SMF ID as well as the Access Type of the PDU Session. If the AMF determines to replace the S-NSSAI received from the UE with the Alternative S-NSSAI or the AMF receives the Alternative S-NSSAI and the S-NSSAI is by the UE, the AMF selects the SMF based on the Alternative S-NSSAI.\nDuring registration procedures, the AMF determines the use of the Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation or User Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation based on UEs indications in the 5G Preferred Network Behaviour, the serving operator policies and the network support of CIoT 5GS optimisations. The AMF selects an SMF that supports Control Plane CIoT 5GS optimisation or User Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation as described in clause 6.3.2 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf the Request Type is \"initial request\" and if the Old PDU Session ID indicating the existing PDU Session is also contained in the message, the AMF selects an SMF as described in clause 4.3.5.2 and stores an association of the new PDU Session ID, the S-NSSAI(s), the selected SMF ID as well as Access Type of the PDU Session.\nIf the Request Type indicates \"Existing PDU Session\", the AMF selects the SMF based on SMF-ID received from UDM. The case where the Request Type indicates \"Existing PDU Session\" and either the AMF does not recognize the PDU Session ID or the subscription context that the AMF received from UDM during the Registration or Subscription Profile Update Notification procedure does not contain an SMF ID corresponding to the PDU Session ID constitutes an error case. The AMF updates the Access Type stored for the PDU Session.\nIf the Request Type indicates \"Existing PDU Session\" referring to an existing PDU Session moved between 3GPP access and non-3GPP access, then if the Serving PLMN S-NSSAI of the PDU Session is present in the Allowed NSSAI of the target access type or Partially Allowed NSSAI, the PDU Session Establishment procedure can be performed in the following cases:\n-\tthe SMF ID corresponding to the PDU Session ID and the AMF belong to the same PLMN;\n-\tthe SMF ID corresponding to the PDU Session ID belongs to the HPLMN;\nOtherwise the AMF shall reject the PDU Session Establishment Request with an appropriate reject cause.\nNOTE 2:\tThe SMF ID includes the PLMN ID that the SMF belongs to.\nThe AMF shall reject a request coming from an Emergency Registered UE and the Request Type indicates neither \"Emergency Request\" nor \"Existing Emergency PDU Session\". When the Request Type indicates \"Emergency Request\", the AMF is not expecting any S-NSSAI and DNN value provided by the UE and uses locally configured values instead. The AMF stores the Access Type of the PDU Session.\nIf the Request Type indicates \"Emergency Request\" or \"Existing Emergency PDU Session\", the AMF selects the SMF as described in clause 5.16.4 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf the AMF is running a slice deregistration inactivity timer for the S-NSSAI of the PDU Session and the timer is associated with the Access Type over which the PDU Session Establishment Request was received, the AMF stops the timer.\n3.\tFrom AMF to SMF: Either Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request (SUPI, selected DNN, UE requested DNN, S-NSSAI(s), [Alternative S-NSSAI], [Slice Area Restriction indication], PDU Session ID, AMF ID, Request Type, [PCF ID, Same PCF Selection Indication], Priority Access, [Small Data Rate Control Status], N1 SM container (PDU Session Establishment Request), User location information, Access Type, RAT Type, PEI, GPSI, UE presence in LADN service area, Subscription For PDU Session Status Notification, DNN Selection Mode, Trace Requirements, Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation indication, Control Plane Only indicator, Satellite backhaul category, GEO Satellite ID, [PVS FQDN(s) and/or PVS IP address(es), Onboarding Indication], Disaster Roaming service indication) or Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request (SUPI, DNN, S-NSSAI(s), SM Context ID, AMF ID, Request Type, N1 SM container (PDU Session Establishment Request), User location information, Access Type, RAT type, PEI, Serving Network (PLMN ID, or PLMN ID and NID, see clause 5.18 of TS 23.501 [2]), Satellite backhaul category, GEO Satellite ID), [PCF binding information, Request for notification of SM Policy Association establishment and termination].\nIf the AMF does not have an association with an SMF for the PDU Session ID provided by the UE (e.g. when Request Type indicates \"initial request\"), the AMF invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request, but if the AMF already has an association with an SMF for the PDU Session ID provided by the UE (e.g. when Request Type indicates \"existing PDU Session\"), the AMF invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request.\nThe AMF sends the S-NSSAI of the Serving PLMN from the Allowed NSSAI or Partially Allowed NSSAI to the SMF. If the AMF determined to replace the S-NSSAI received from the UE with an Alternative S-NSSAI and the AMF selected the SMF based on the Alternative S-NSSAI in step 2, the AMF sends both the S-NSSAI value of the Alternative S-NSSAI and the S-NSSAI value of the S-NSSAI received from the UE to the SMF. If the Alternative S-NSSAI and the S-NSSAI is provided by the UE and the AMF selected the SMF based on the Alternative S-NSSAI in step 2, the AMF sends both the S-NSSAI value of the Alternative S-NSSAI and the S-NSSAI value of the S-NSSAI received from the UE to the SMF. For roaming scenario in local breakout (LBO), the AMF also sends the corresponding S-NSSAI of the HPLMN from the Mapping Of Allowed NSSAI or Mapping Of Partially Allowed NSSAI to the SMF. If the AMF determines to replace the HPLMN S-NSSAI received from the UE with the HPLMN Alternative S-NSSAI or the AMF receives the HPLMN Alternative S-NSSAI and the HPLMN S-NSSAI provided by the UE, the AMF sends both HPLMN S-NSSAI and HPLMN Alternative S-NSSAI to the SMF.\nWhen the AMF determines that the S-NSSAI is subject to area restriction, i.e. the S-NSSAI is configured with an NS-AoS, or the S-NSSAI is present in the Partially Allowed NSSAI, the AMF sends Slice Area Restriction indication to SMF indicating that the PDU Session is subject to area restriction for the S-NSSAI. If the S-NSSAI is replaced with the Alternative S-NSSAI, the AMF checks the area restriction only for the Replaced S-NSSAI.\nThe AMF ID is the UE's GUAMI which uniquely identifies the AMF serving the UE. The AMF forwards the PDU Session ID together with the N1 SM container containing the PDU Session Establishment Request received from the UE. The GPSI shall be included if available at AMF.\nThe AMF determines Access Type and RAT Type, see clause 4.2.2.2.1.\nThe AMF provides the PEI instead of the SUPI when the UE in limited service state has registered for Emergency services (i.e. Emergency Registered) without providing a SUPI. The PEI is defined in clause 5.9.3 of TS 23.501 [2]. If the UE in limited service state has registered for Emergency services (i.e. Emergency Registered) with a SUPI but has not been authenticated the AMF indicates that the SUPI has not been authenticated. The SMF determines that the UE has not been authenticated when it does not receive a SUPI for the UE or when the AMF indicates that the SUPI has not been authenticated.\nIf the AMF determines that the selected DNN corresponds to an LADN then the AMF provides the \"UE presence in LADN service area\" that indicates if the UE is IN or OUT of the LADN service area. If the AMF enforces the LADN Service Area per LADN DNN and S-NSSAI, then the AMF also provides an indication that \"the PDU Session is subject to LADN per LADN DNN and S-NSSAI\".\nIf the Old PDU Session ID is included in step 1 and if the SMF is not to be reallocated, the AMF also includes Old PDU Session ID in the Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request.\nDNN Selection Mode is determined by the AMF. It indicates whether an explicitly subscribed DNN has been provided by the UE in its PDU Session Establishment Request.\nThe SMF may use DNN Selection Mode when deciding whether to accept or reject the UE request.\nWhen the Establishment cause received as part of AN parameters during the Registration procedure or Service Request procedure is associated with priority services (e.g. MPS, MCX), or when the AMF determines the UE has priority subscription (e.g. MPS, MCX) in the UDM, the AMF includes a Message Priority header to indicate priority information. The SMF uses the Message Priority header to determine if the UE request is subject to exemption from NAS level congestion control. Other NFs relay the priority information by including the Message Priority header in service-based interfaces, as specified in TS 29.500 [17].\nIn the local breakout case, if the SMF (in the VPLMN) is not able to process some part of the N1 SM information that Home Routed Roaming is required and the SMF responds to the AMF that it is not the right SMF to handle the N1 SM message by invoking Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Response service operation. The SMF includes a proper N11 cause code triggering the AMF to proceed with home routed case. The procedure starts again at step 2 of clause 4.3.2.2.2.\nIn the non-roaming case, for PDU Session with Request Type \"initial request\", the AMF checks if the PCF Selection Assistance info from the UDM indicates that the same PCF is required for the requested DNN and S-NSSAI and if required, the AMF includes in Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request both the Same PCF Selection Indication and the PCF ID selected by the AMF, this PCF ID identifies the H-PCF,\nIf PCF Selection Assistance info is not received from the UDM, the AMF may include a PCF ID in the Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request based on operator policies. This PCF ID identifies the H-PCF in the non-roaming case and the V-PCF in the local breakout roaming case.\nThe AMF includes Trace Requirements if Trace Requirements have been received in subscription data.\nIf the AMF decides to use the Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation or User Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation as specified in step 2 or to only use Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation for the PDU session as described in clause 5.31.4 of TS 23.501 [2], the AMF sends the Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation indication or Control Plane Only indicator to the SMF.\nIf the AMF determines that the RAT type is NB-IoT and the number of PDU Sessions with user plane resources activated for the UE has reached the maximum number of supported user plane resources (0, 1 or 2) based on whether the UE supports UP data transfer and the UE's 5GMM Core Network Capability as described in clause 5.31.19 of TS 23.501 [2], the AMF may either reject the PDU Session Establishment Request or continue with the PDU Session establishment and include the Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation indication or Control Plane Only indicator to the SMF.\nThe AMF includes the latest Small Data Rate Control Status if it has stored it for the PDU Session.\nIf the RAT type was included in the message, then the SMF stores the RAT type in SM Context.\nIf the UE supports CE mode B and use of CE mode B is not restricted according to the Enhanced Coverage Restriction information in the UE context in the AMF, then the AMF shall include the extended NAS-SM timer indication. Based on the extended NAS-SM timer indication, the SMF shall use the extended NAS-SM timer setting for the UE as specified in TS 24.501 [25].\nIf the identity of an NWDAF is available to the AMF, the AMF informs the SMF of the NWDAF ID(s) used for UE related Analytics and corresponding Analytics ID(s).\nIf the AMF, based on configuration, is aware that the UE is accessing over a gNB using satellite backhaul as defined in clause 5.43.4 of TS 23.501 [2], the AMF determines the type of satellite backhaul category and includes Satellite backhaul category to the SMF.\nIf the AMF, based on configuration, is aware that the UE is accessing over a gNB using GEO satellite backhaul, the AMF may, based on configuration, include the GEO satellite ID as described in clause 5.43.2 of TS 23.501 [2].\nThe AMF may provide the Disaster Roaming service indication as specified in TS 23.501 [2].\n4.\tIf Session Management Subscription data for corresponding SUPI, DNN and S-NSSAI of the HPLMN is not available, then SMF retrieves the Session Management Subscription data using Nudm_SDM_Get (SUPI, Session Management Subscription data, selected DNN, S-NSSAI of the HPLMN, Serving PLMN ID, [NID]) and subscribes to be notified when this subscription data is modified using Nudm_SDM_Subscribe (SUPI, Session Management Subscription data, selected DNN, S-NSSAI of the HPLMN, Serving PLMN ID, [NID]). The UDM may get this information from UDR by Nudr_DM_Query (SUPI, Subscription Data, Session Management Subscription data, selected DNN, S-NSSAI of the HPLMN, Serving PLMN ID, [NID]) and may subscribe to notifications from UDR for the same data by Nudr_DM_subscribe. If a S-NSSAI is subject to network slice usage control and the S-NSSAI is dedicated to a single AF, for a PDU Session for non-roaming subscribers, the UDM may provide a Slice Usage Policy information including whether a network slice is on demand and a PDU Session inactivity timer value as described in clause 5.15.15 of TS 23.501 [2]. If the SMF received Alternative S-NSSAI (for the HPLMN in roaming case) in step 3, the SMF retrieves subscription data as specified in clause 5.15.19 of TS 23.501 [2].\nThe SMF may use DNN Selection Mode when deciding whether to retrieve the Session Management Subscription data e.g. if the (selected DNN, S-NSSAI of the HPLMN) is not explicitly subscribed, the SMF may use local configuration instead of Session Management Subscription data.\nIf the Request Type in step 3 indicates \"Existing PDU Session\" or \"Existing Emergency PDU Session\" the SMF determines that the request is due to switching between 3GPP access and non-3GPP access or due to handover from EPS. The SMF identifies the existing PDU Session based on the PDU Session ID. In such a case, the SMF does not create a new SM context but instead updates the existing SM context and provides the representation of the updated SM context to the AMF in the response.\nIf the Request Type is \"Initial request\" and if the Old PDU Session ID is included in Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request, the SMF identifies the existing PDU Session to be released based on the Old PDU Session ID.\nThe Subscription data includes the Allowed PDU Session Type(s), Allowed SSC mode(s), default 5QI and ARP, subscribed Session-AMBR, SMF-Associated external parameters.\nIP Index or Static IP address/prefix may be included in the subscription data if the UE has subscribed to it.\nThe SMF checks the validity of the UE request: it checks:\n-\tWhether the UE request is compliant with the user subscription and with local policies;\n-\t(If the selected DNN corresponds to an LADN), whether the UE is located within the LADN service area based on the \"UE presence in LADN service area\" indication from the AMF. If the AMF does not provide the \"UE presence in LADN service area\" indication and the SMF determines that the selected DNN corresponds to a LADN, then the SMF considers that the UE is OUT of the LADN service area.\nThe SMF determines whether the PDU Session requires redundancy and the SMF determines the RSN as described in clause 5.33.2.1 of TS 23.501 [2]. If the SMF determines that redundant handling is not allowed or not possible for the given PDU Session, the SMF shall either reject the establishment of the PDU Session or accept the establishment of a PDU session without redundancy handling based on local policy.\nIf the UE request is considered as not valid, the SMF decides to not accept to establish the PDU Session.\nNOTE 3:\tThe SMF can, instead of the Nudm_SDM_Get service operation, use the Nudm_SDM_Subscribe service operation with an Immediate Report Indication that triggers the UDM to immediately return the subscribed data if the corresponding feature is supported by both the SMF and the UDM.\nFor a Disaster Roaming service, the UDM provides the Session Management Subscription data to the SMF based on the local policy and/or the local configuration as specified in clause 5.40.4 of TS 23.501 [2].\nFor an S-NSSAI subject to NSAC and if LBO applies, the SMF in supporting VPLMN stores the applicable NSAC admission mode.\n5.\tFrom SMF to AMF: Either Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Response (Cause, SM Context ID or N1 SM container (PDU Session Reject (Cause))) or an Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response depending on the request received in step 3.\nIf the SMF received Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request in step 3 and the SMF is able to process the PDU Session establishment request, the SMF creates an SM context and responds to the AMF by providing an SM Context ID.\nIf the UP Security Policy for the PDU Session is determined to have Integrity Protection set to \"Required\", the SMF may, based on local configuration, decide whether to accept or reject the PDU Session request based on the UE Integrity Protection Maximum Data Rate.\nNOTE 4:\tThe SMF can e.g. be configured to reject a PDU Session if the UE Integrity Protection Maximum Data Rate has a very low value, if the services provided by the DN would require higher bitrates.\nWhen the SMF decides to not accept to establish a PDU Session, the SMF rejects the UE request via NAS SM signalling including a relevant SM rejection cause by responding to the AMF with Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Response. The SMF also indicates to the AMF that the PDU Session ID is to be considered as released, the SMF proceeds to step 20 and the PDU Session Establishment procedure is stopped.\n6.\tOptional Secondary authentication/authorization.\nIf the Request Type in step 3 indicates \"Existing PDU Session\", the SMF does not perform secondary authentication/authorization.\nIf the Request Type received in step 3 indicates \"Emergency Request\" or \"Existing Emergency PDU Session\", the SMF shall not perform secondary authentication\\authorization.\nIf the SMF needs to perform secondary authentication/authorization during the establishment of the PDU Session by a DN-AAA Server as described in clause 5.6.6 of TS 23.501 [2], the SMF triggers the PDU Session establishment authentication/authorization as described in clause 4.3.2.3.\n7a.\tIf dynamic PCC is to be used for the PDU Session, the SMF performs PCF selection as described in clause 6.3.7.1 of TS 23.501 [2]. If the Request Type indicates \"Existing PDU Session\" or \"Existing Emergency PDU Session\", the SMF shall use the PCF already selected for the PDU Session.\nOtherwise, the SMF may apply local policy.\n7b.\tThe SMF may perform an SM Policy Association Establishment procedure as defined in clause 4.16.4 to establish an SM Policy Association with the PCF and get the default PCC Rules for the PDU Session. The SMF shall include the 3GPP Data Off status if received in step 1. The GPSI, PVS FQDN(s) and/or PVS IP address(es) and the Onboarding Indication shall be included if available at SMF in the case of ON-SNPN. The SMF shall include both the S-NSSAI and the Alternative S-NSSAI, if received in step 3. If the Request Type in step 3 indicates \"Existing PDU Session\", the SMF provides information on the Policy Control Request Trigger condition(s) that have been met by an SMF initiated SM Policy Association Modification procedure as defined in clause 4.16.5.1. The PCF may provide policy information defined in clause 5.2.5.4 (and in TS 23.503 [20]) to SMF.\nThe PCF for the UE subscribes to notifications of event \"UE reporting Connection Capabilities from associated URSP rule\" as defined in clause 6.1.3.18 in TS 23.503 [20], using Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Subscribe (EventId set to \"UE reporting Connection Capabilities from associated URSP rule\", EventFilter set to at least \"list of Connection Capabilities\") to the PCF for the PDU Session. The PCF for session may notify the PCF for UE about the URSP rule enforcement together with the PDU session parameters that this application associated with by Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Notify.\nDuring the SM Policy Association Establishment procedure, if the PCF detects the request relates to SM Policy Association enabling integration with TSN or TSC or Deterministic Networking (as defined in TS 23.501 [2] clause 5.28) based on local configuration (e.g. for a certain requested DNN/S-NSSAI for which Time Sensitive Networking, Time Sensitive Communications, Time Synchronization and/or Deterministic Networking is applicable), the PCF may provide policy control request trigger for 5GS Bridge/Router Information as defined in clause 6.1.3.5 of TS 23.503 [20].\nThe PCF, based on the Emergency DNN, sets the ARP of the PCC rules to a value that is reserved for Emergency services as described in TS 23.503 [20].\nNOTE 5:\tThe purpose of step 7 is to receive PCC rules before selecting UPF. If PCC rules are not needed as input for UPF selection, step 7 can be performed after step 8.\n-\tDuring the SM Policy Association Establishment procedure for PDU Sessions for non-roaming UEs, if a S-NSSAI is subject to network slice usage control, the PCF may provide a Slice Usage Policy information including whether a network slice is on demand and a PDU Session inactivity timer value as described in clause 5.15.15 of TS 23.501 [2].\n8.\tIf the Request Type in step 3 indicates \"Initial request\", the SMF selects an SSC mode for the PDU Session as described in clause 5.6.9.3 of TS 23.501 [2]. The SMF also selects one or more UPFs as needed as described in clause 6.3.3 of TS 23.501 [2]. In the case of PDU Session Type IPv4 or IPv6 or IPv4v6, the SMF allocates an IP address/prefix for the PDU Session (unless configured otherwise) as described in clause 5.8.2 of TS 23.501 [2]. In the case of PDU Session Type IPv6 or IPv4v6, the SMF also allocates an interface identifier to the UE for the UE to build its link-local address. For Unstructured PDU Session Type the SMF may allocate an IPv6 prefix for the PDU Session and N6 point-to-point tunnelling (based on UDP/IPv6) as described in clause 5.6.10.3 of TS 23.501 [2]. For Ethernet PDU Session Type, neither a MAC nor an IP address is allocated by the SMF to the UE for this PDU Session.\nIf the AMF indicated Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation in step 3 for this PDU session, then,\n1)\tFor Unstructured PDU Session Type, the SMF checks whether UE's subscription include a \"NEF Identity for NIDD\" for the DNN/S-NSSAI combination. When the \"NEF Identity for NIDD\" is present in the UE's subscription data, the SMF will select the NEF identified for the S-NSSAI and selected DNN in the \"NEF Identity for NIDD\" as the anchor of this PDU Session. Otherwise, the SMF will select a UPF as the anchor of this PDU Session.\n2)\tFor other PDU Session Types, the SMF will perform UPF selection to select a UPF as the anchor of this PDU Session.\nIf the Request Type in Step 3 is \"Existing PDU Session\", the SMF maintains the same IP address/prefix that has already been allocated to the UE in the source network.\nIf the Request Type in step 3 indicates \"Existing PDU Session\" referring to an existing PDU Session moved between 3GPP access and non-3GPP access the SMF maintains the SSC mode of the PDU Session, the current PDU Session Anchor and IP address.\nNOTE 6:\tThe SMF may decide to trigger e.g. new intermediate UPF insertion or allocation of a new UPF as described in step 5 in clause 4.2.3.2.\nIf the Request Type indicates \"Emergency Request\", the SMF selects the UPF as described in clause 5.16.4 of TS 23.501 [2] and selects SSC mode 1.\nSMF may select a UPF (e.g. based on requested DNN/S-NSSAI) that supports NW-TT functionality.\nSMF may select a PSA UPF that supports PDU Set identification and marking for a QoS flow with PDU Set based handling capability.\n9.\tSMF may perform an SMF initiated SM Policy Association Modification procedure as defined in clause 4.16.5.1 to provide information on the Policy Control Request Trigger condition(s) that have been met. If Request Type is \"initial request\" and dynamic PCC is deployed and PDU Session Type is IPv4 or IPv6 or IPv4v6, SMF notifies the PCF (if the Policy Control Request Trigger condition is met) with the allocated UE IP address/prefix(es).\nNOTE 7:\tIf an IP address/prefix has been allocated before step 7 (e.g. subscribed static IP address/prefix in UDM/UDR) or the step 7 is performed after step 8, the IP address/prefix can be provided to PCF in step 7 and the IP address/prefix notification in this step can be skipped.\nIf the PCF has subscribed to Policy Control Request Trigger for \"UE reporting Connection Capabilities from associated URSP rule\" and if SMF received the URSP rule enforcement report (i.e. connection capabilities information) from the UE at step 1, then the SMF may include the URSP rule enforcement report as described in clause 6.1.3.5 of TS 23.503 [20] and clause 6.6.2.4 of TS 23.503 [20].\nThe PCF may provide updated policies to the SMF. The PCF may provide policy information defined in clause 5.2.5.4 (and in TS 23.503 [20]) to SMF.\nThe PCF may make policy control decisions based on the awareness of URSP rule enforcement, as described in clause 6.1.1.5 in TS 23.503 [20].\n10.\tIf Request Type indicates \"initial request\", the SMF initiates an N4 Session Establishment procedure with the selected UPF(s), otherwise it initiates an N4 Session Modification procedure with the selected UPF(s):\n10a.\tThe SMF sends an N4 Session Establishment/Modification Request to the UPF and provides Packet detection, enforcement and reporting rules to be installed on the UPF for this PDU Session. If the SMF is configured to request IP address allocation from UPF as described in clause 5.8.2 of TS 23.501 [2] then the SMF indicates to the UPF to perform the IP address/prefix allocation and includes the information required for the UPF to perform the allocation. If the selective User Plane deactivation is required for this PDU Session, the SMF determines the inactivity timer and provides it to the UPF. For a PDU Session for non-roaming subscribers, if the S-NSSAI of the PDU Session is subject to network slice usage control, the SMF obtains the PDU Session inactivity timer value for the PDU Session as described in step 4 or step 7 or uses preconfigured value and configures the UPF to run the PDU Session inactivity timer. The SMF provides Trace Requirements to the UPF if it has received Trace Requirements. If the Reliable Data Service is enabled for the PDU Session by the SMF as specified in TS 23.501 [2], the RDS Configuration information is provided to the UPF in this step. The SMF provides Small Data Rate Control parameters to the UPF for the PDU Session, if required. The SMF provides the Small Data Rate Control Status to the UPF, if received from the AMF. If the Serving PLMN intends to enforce Serving PLMN Rate Control (see clause 5.31.14.2 of TS 23.501 [2]) for this PDU session then the SMF shall provide Serving PLMN Rate Control parameters to UPF for limiting the rate of downlink control plane data packets.\nFor a PDU Session of type Ethernet or IP, if the trigger for 5GS Bridge/Router information is armed in step 7b, the SMF, based on local configuration (e.g. for a certain requested DNN/S-NSSAI for which Time Sensitive Networking, Time Sensitive Communications, Time Synchronization and/or Deterministic Networking is applicable), includes a bridge information indication or a router information indication to request the UPF to provide a port number.\nIf SMF decides to perform redundant transmission for one or more QoS Flows of the PDU session as described in clause 5.33.1.2 of TS 23.501 [2], two CN Tunnel Info are requested by the SMF from the UPF. The SMF also indicates the UPF to eliminate the duplicated packet for the QoS Flow in uplink direction. The SMF indicates the UPF that one CN Tunnel Info is used as the redundancy tunnel of the PDU session described in clause 5.33.2.2 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf SMF decides to insert two I-UPFs between the PSA UPF and the NG-RAN for redundant transmission as described in clause 5.33.1.2 of TS 23.501 [2], the SMF requests the corresponding CN Tunnel Info and provides them to the I-UPFs and PSA UPF respectively. The SMF also indicates the PSA UPF to eliminate the duplicated packet for the QoS Flow in uplink direction. The SMF indicates the PSA UPF that one CN Tunnel Info is used as the redundancy tunnel of the PDU session described in clause 5.33.2.2 of TS 23.501 [2].\nNOTE 8:\tThe method to perform elimination and reordering on RAN/UPF based on the packets received from the two GTP-U tunnels is up to RAN/UPF implementation. The two GTP-U tunnels are terminated at the same RAN node and UPF.\nIf Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation is enabled for this PDU session and the SMF selects the NEF as the anchor of this PDU Session in step 8, the SMF performs SMF-NEF Connection Establishment Procedure as described in clause 4.25.2.\nIf interworking with TSN deployed in the transport network is supported (see clause 4.4.8 of TS 23.501 [2]) and the UPF supports CN-TL, the SMF includes a TL-Container with a get-request to the N4 Session Establishment/Modification request that is sent to the UPF, as described in clause 5.28a.2 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf SMF decides to enable ECN marking for L4S by PSA UPF, a QoS Flow level ECN marking for L4S indicator shall be sent by SMF to PSA UPF over N4 as described in clause 5.37.3.3 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf selected PSA UPF supports Nupf_EventExposure service, the SMF should include DNN and S-NSSAI in the N4 Session Establishment procedure.\nNOTE 9:\tIf SMF does not provide DNN and S-NSSAI to UPF it could result in rejections for the Nupf_EventExposure_Subscribe service operations, unless UPF is configured with a DNN and S-NSSAI for a specific IP address range.\n10b.\tThe UPF acknowledges by sending an N4 Session Establishment/Modification Response.\nIf the SMF indicates in step 10a that IP address/prefix allocation is to be performed by the UPF then this response contains the requested IP address/prefix. The requested CN Tunnel Info is provided to SMF in this step. If SMF indicated the UPF to perform packet duplication and elimination for the QoS Flow in step 10a, two CN Tunnel Info are allocated by the UPF and provided to the SMF. If SMF decides to insert two I-UPFs between the PSA UPF and the NG-RAN for redundant transmission as described in clause 5.33.1.2 of TS 23.501 [2], CN Tunnel Info of two I-UPFs and the UPF (PSA) are allocated by the UPFs and provided to the SMF. The UPF indicates the SMF that one CN Tunnel Info is used as the redundancy tunnel of the PDU session as described in clause 5.33.2.2 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf SMF requested UPF to provide a port number then UPF includes the port number and user-plane Node ID in the response according to TS 23.501 [2]. To support integration with IEEE TSN, the user-plane node ID is Bridge ID. To support integration with IETF DetNet, the user-plane node ID can be Router ID. Besides the network instance, the SMF may also provide DNN/S-NSSAI for the UPF to respond with user-plane Node ID based on pre-configuration information.\nIf multiple UPFs are selected for the PDU Session, the SMF initiate N4 Session Establishment/Modification procedure with each UPF of the PDU Session in this step.\nNOTE 10:\tIf the PCF has subscribed to the UE IP address change Policy Control Trigger (as specified in clause 6.1.3.5 of TS 23.503 [20]) then the SMF notifies the PCF about the IP address/prefix allocated by the UPF. This is not shown in figure 4.3.2.2.1-1.\nIf interworking with TSN deployed in the transport network is supported and the UPF supports CN-TL and received a TL-Container with a get-request from the SMF/CUC in step 10a (see clause 4.4.8 of TS 23.501 [2]), the UPF/CN-TL includes a TL-Container with a get-response in the N4 Session Establishment/Modification response, as described in clause 5.28a.2 of TS 23.501 [2]. The SMF/CUC stores the information provided in the get-response.\n11.\tSMF to AMF: Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer (PDU Session ID, N2 SM information (PDU Session ID, QFI(s), QoS Profile(s), CN Tunnel Info, S-NSSAI from the Allowed NSSAI or Partially Allowed NSSAI, Session-AMBR, PDU Session Type, User Plane Security Enforcement information, UE Integrity Protection Maximum Data Rate, RSN, PDU Session Pair ID, TL-Container), N1 SM container (PDU Session Establishment Accept ([QoS Rule(s) and associated UL Protocol Description(s) (if available), QoS Flow level QoS parameters if needed for the QoS Flow(s) associated with the QoS rule(s)], selected SSC mode, S-NSSAI(s), UE Requested DNN, allocated IPv4 address, interface identifier, Session-AMBR, selected PDU Session Type, [Reflective QoS Timer] (if available), [P-CSCF address(es)], [Control Plane Only indicator], [Header Compression Configuration], [Always-on PDU Session Granted], [Small Data Rate Control parameters], [Small Data Rate Control Status], [Serving PLMN Rate Control], [PVS FQDN(s) and/or PVS IP address(es)], [Non-3GPP QoS Assistance Information Container]))). If multiple UPFs are used for the PDU Session, the CN Tunnel Info contains tunnel information related with the UPFs that terminate N3.\nThe SMF may provide the SMF derived CN assisted RAN parameters tuning to the AMF by invoking Nsmf_PDUSession_SMContextStatusNotify (SMF derived CN assisted RAN parameters tuning) service. The AMF stores the SMF derived CN assisted RAN parameters tuning in the associated PDU Session context for this UE.\nThe N2 SM information carries information that the AMF shall forward to the (R)AN which includes:\n-\tThe CN Tunnel Info corresponds to the Core Network address(es) of the N3 tunnel corresponding to the PDU Session. If two CN Tunnel Info are included for the PDU session for redundant transmission, the SMF also indicates the NG-RAN that one of the CN Tunnel Info used as the redundancy tunnel of the PDU session as described in clause 5.33.2.2 of TS 23.501 [2].\n-\tOne or multiple QoS profiles and the corresponding QFIs can be provided to the (R)AN. This is further described in clause 5.7 of TS 23.501 [2]. The SMF may indicate for each QoS Flow whether redundant transmission shall be performed by a corresponding redundant transmission indicator.\n-\tThe PDU Session ID may be used by AN signalling with the UE to indicate to the UE the association between (R)AN resources and a PDU Session for the UE.\n-\tA PDU Session is associated to an S-NSSAI of the HPLMN and if applicable, to an S-NSSAI of the VPLMN and a DNN. The S-NSSAI provided to the (R)AN, is the S-NSSAI with the value for the Serving PLMN (i.e. the HPLMN S-NSSAI or, in LBO roaming case, the VPLMN S-NSSAI). When Alternative S-NSSAI is received from AMF in step 3, the S-NSSAI provided to the (R)AN is the Alternative S-NSSAI.\n-\tUser Plane Security Enforcement information is determined by the SMF as described in clause 5.10.3 of TS 23.501 [2].\n-\tIf the User Plane Security Enforcement information indicates that Integrity Protection is \"Preferred\" or \"Required\", the SMF also includes the UE Integrity Protection Maximum Data Rate as received in the PDU Session Establishment Request.\n-\tThe use of the RSN parameter and the PDU Session Pair ID by NG-RAN are described in clause 5.33.2.1 of TS 23.501 [2].\n-\tFor each QoS Flow, the SMF may at most request one of the following to the NG-RAN:\n-\tECN marking for L4S at NG-RAN in the case of ECN marking for L4S in RAN as described in clause 5.37.3 of TS 23.501 [2]; or\n-\tCongestion information monitoring as described in clauses 5.45.3 and 5.37.4 of TS 23.501 [2]; or\n-\tprovide information for ECN marking for L4S at UPF in the case of ECN marking for L4S by PSA UPF as described in clause 5.37.3 of TS 23.501 [2].\n-\tTL-Container as described in clause 5.28a.2 of TS 23.501 [2]. If interworking with TSN deployed in the transport network is supported and the NG-RAN supports AN-TL (see clause 4.4.8 of TS 23.501 [2]), the SMF includes a TL-Container with a get-request to the N2 SM information, as described in clause 5.28a.2 of TS 23.501 [2].\nThe N1 SM container contains the PDU Session Establishment Accept that the AMF shall provide to the UE. If the UE requested P-CSCF discovery then the message shall also include the P-CSCF IP address(es) as determined by the SMF and as described in clause 5.16.3.4 of TS 23.501 [2]. The PDU Session Establishment Accept includes S-NSSAI from the Allowed NSSAI or Partially Allowed NSSAI. The S-NSSAI value of the Alternative S-NSSAI is included in the PDU session Establishment Accept if the SMF has received the Alternative S-NSSAI from the AMF. For LBO roaming scenario, the PDU Session Establishment Accept includes the S-NSSAI from the Allowed NSSAI or Partially Allowed NSSAI for the VPLMN and also it includes the corresponding S-NSSAI of the HPLMN from the Mapping Of Allowed NSSAI or Mapping Of Partially Allowed NSSAI that SMF received in step 3. If the SMF has received the VPLMN Alternative S-NSSAI from the AMF, the PDU Session Establishment Accept includes the VPLMN Alternative S-NSSAI. If the SMF has received the HPLMN Alternative S-NSSAI from the AMF, the PDU Session Establishment Accept includes the HPLMN Alternative S-NSSAI. If the PCF, based on the local configuration, provides the PCC rules with Protocol Descriptions for UL in step 7b or step 9, the SMF may additionally provide the Protocol Description for UL with the associated QoS rule as described in clause 5.37.5.1 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf the PDU Session being established was requested to be an always-on PDU Session, the SMF shall indicate whether the request is accepted by including an Always-on PDU Session Granted indication in the PDU Session Establishment Accept message. If the PDU Session being established was not requested to be an always-on PDU Session but the SMF determines that the PDU Session needs to be established as an always-on PDU Session, the SMF shall include an Always-on PDU Session Granted indication in the PDU Session Establishment Accept message indicating that the PDU session is an always-on PDU Session.\nIf Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation is enabled for this PDU session, the N2 SM information is not included in this step. If Control Plane CIoT 5GS optimisation is enabled for this PDU session and the UE has sent the Header Compression Configuration in the PDU Session Establishment Request and the SMF supports the header compression parameters, the SMF shall include the Header Compression Configuration in the PDU Session Establishment Accept message. If the UE has included Header Compression context parameters in Header Compression Configuration in the PDU Session Establishment Request, the SMF shall establish the header compression context and may acknowledge the Header Compression context parameters. If the header compression context is not established during the PDU Session Establishment procedure, before using the compressed format for sending the data, the UE and the SMF need to establish the header compression context based on the Header Compression Configuration. If the SMF has received the Control Plane Only Indicator in step 3, the SMF shall include the Control Plane Only Indicator in the PDU Session Establishment Accept message. The SMF shall indicate the use of Control Plane only on its CDR. If the Small Data Rate Control is configured in the SMF, the SMF shall also include Small Data Rate Control parameters and the Small Data Rate Control Status (if received from the AMF) in the PDU Session Establishment Accept message as described in clause 5.31.14.3 of TS 23.501 [2]. If the Serving PLMN intends to enforce Serving PLMN Rate Control (see clause 5.31.14.2 of TS 23.501 [2]) for this PDU session then the SMF shall include the Serving PLMN Rate Control parameters in the PDU Session Establishment Accept message. The UE shall store and use Serving PLMN Rate Control parameters as the maximum allowed limit of uplink control plane user data.\nIf the UE indicates the support of RDS in the PCO in the PDU Session Establishment Request and RDS is enabled for the PDU Session, the SMF shall inform the UE that RDS is enabled in the PCO in the PDU Session Establishment Accept (see clause 5.31.6 of TS 23.501 [2]).\nIf the NIDD parameters (e.g. maximum packet size) were received from NEF during the SMF-NEF Connection Establishment procedure in step 10, the SMF shall inform the UE of the NIDD parameters in the PCO in the PDU Session Establishment Accept (see clause 5.31.5 of TS 23.501 [2]).\nIf the UE indicated in the PCO that it supports the ability to receive ECS address(es) via NAS, the SMF may provide the ECS Address Configuration Information (as described in clause 6.5.2 of TS 23.548 [74]) to the UE in the PCO. The SMF may derive the ECS Address Configuration Information based on local configuration and/or UE subscription information. In non-roaming scenarios, the SMF may also derive the ECS Address Configuration Information based on the UE's location.\nIf the UE indicated in the PCO that it supports the EDC functionality, the SMF may indicate to the UE either that the use of the EDC functionality is allowed for the PDU Session or that the use of the EDC functionality is required for the PDU Session (see clause 5.2.1 of TS 23.548 [74]).\nMultiple QoS Rules, QoS Flow level QoS parameters if needed for the QoS Flow(s) associated with those QoS rule(s) and QoS Profiles may be included in the PDU Session Establishment Accept within the N1 SM and in the N2 SM information.\nThe Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer contains the PDU Session ID allowing the AMF to know which access towards the UE to use.\nIf the PDU session establishment failed anywhere between step 5 and step 11, then the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer request shall include the N1 SM container with a PDU Session Establishment Reject message (see clause 8.3.3 of TS 24.501 [25]) and shall not include any N2 SM container. The (R)AN sends the NAS message containing the PDU Session Establishment Reject to the UE. In this case, steps 12-17 are skipped.\nBased on the S-NSSAI and DNN for PIN, the SMF may provide the UE with per QoS-flow Non-3GPP QoS Assistance Information in the N1 SM container as specified in clause 5.44.3.3 of TS 23.501 [2].\n12.\tAMF to (R)AN: N2 PDU Session Request (N2 SM information, NAS message (PDU Session ID, N1 SM container (PDU Session Establishment Accept)), [CN assisted RAN parameters tuning]). If the N2 SM information is not included in the step 11, an N2 Downlink NAS Transport message is used instead.\nThe AMF sends the NAS message containing PDU Session ID and PDU Session Establishment Accept targeted to the UE and the N2 SM information received from the SMF within the N2 PDU Session Request to the (R)AN.\nIf the SMF derived CN assisted RAN parameters tuning are stored for the activated PDU Session(s), the AMF may derive updated CN assisted RAN parameters tuning and provide them the (R)AN.\n13.\t(R)AN to UE: The (R)AN may issue AN specific signalling exchange with the UE that is related with the information received from SMF. For example, in the case of a NG-RAN, an RRC Connection Reconfiguration may take place with the UE establishing the necessary NG-RAN resources related to the QoS Rules for the PDU Session request received in step 12.\n(R)AN also allocates (R)AN Tunnel Info for the PDU Session. In the case of Dual Connectivity, the Master RAN node may assign some (zero or more) QFIs to be setup to a Master RAN node and others to the Secondary RAN node. The AN Tunnel Info includes a tunnel endpoint for each involved (R)AN node and the QFIs assigned to each tunnel endpoint. A QFI can be assigned to either the Master RAN node or the Secondary RAN node and not to both.\nIf the (R)AN receives two CN Tunnel Info for a PDU session in step 12 for redundant transmission, (R)AN also allocates two AN Tunnel Info correspondingly and indicate to SMF one of the AN Tunnel Info is used as the redundancy tunnel of the PDU session as described in clause 5.33.2.2 of TS 23.501 [2].\n(R)AN forwards the NAS message (PDU Session ID, N1 SM container (PDU Session Establishment Accept)) provided in step 12 to the UE. (R)AN shall only provide the NAS message to the UE if the AN specific signalling exchange with the UE includes the (R)AN resource additions associated to the received N2 command.\nIf MICO mode is active and the NAS message Request Type in step 1 indicated \"Emergency Request\", then the UE and the AMF shall locally deactivate MICO mode.\nIf the N2 SM information is not included in the step 11, then the following steps 14 to 16b and step 17 are omitted.\nIf the UE is running a slice deregistration inactivity timer for the S-NSSAI of the established PDU Session and the timer is associated with the Access Type over which the PDU Session Establishment Request was received, the UE stops the timer as described in clause 5.15.15 of TS 23.501 [2].\n14.\t(R)AN to AMF: N2 PDU Session Response (PDU Session ID, Cause, N2 SM information (PDU Session ID, AN Tunnel Info, List of accepted/rejected QFI(s), User Plane Enforcement Policy Notification, TL-Container, established QoS Flows status (active/not active) (for one of the following: congestion information monitoring, ECN marking for L4S at PSA UPF, ECN marking for L4S at NG-RAN), PDU Set Based Handling Support Indication)).\nThe AN Tunnel Info corresponds to the Access Network address of the N3 tunnel corresponding to the PDU Session.\nThe (R)AN may reject the addition or modification of a QoS Flow, e.g. due to handling of the UE-Slice-MBR as described in clause 5.7.1.10 of TS 23.501 [2]. If the (R)AN rejects QFI(s) the SMF is responsible of updating the QoS rules and QoS Flow level QoS parameters associated to the rejected QoS Flow(s) in the UE accordingly.\nThe NG-RAN rejects the establishment of UP resources for the PDU Session when it cannot fulfil User Plane Security Enforcement information with a value of Required. The NG-RAN notifies the SMF when it cannot fulfil a User Plane Security Enforcement with a value of Preferred.\nIf the NG-RAN cannot establish redundant user plane for the PDU Session as indicated by the RSN parameter and PDU Session Pair ID, the NG-RAN takes the decision on whether to reject the establishment of RAN resources for the PDU Session based on local policies as described in TS 23.501 [2].\nIf interworking with TSN deployed in the transport network is supported and the NG-RAN supports AN-TL and received a TL-Container with a get-request from the SMF/CUC in step 12 (see clause 4.4.8 of TS 23.501 [2]), the NG-RAN/AN-TL includes a TL-Container with a get-response to the N2 SM information, as described in clause 5.28a.2 of TS 23.501 [2].\nNG-RAN includes the PDU Set Based Handling Support Indication in N2 SM information as defined in clause 5.37.5.3 of TS 23.501 [2].\n15.\tAMF to SMF: Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request (SM Context ID, N2 SM information, Request Type).\nThe AMF forwards the N2 SM information received from (R)AN to the SMF.\nIf the list of rejected QFI(s) is included in N2 SM information, the SMF shall release the rejected QFI(s) associated QoS profiles.\nIf the N2 SM information indicates failure of user plane resource setup, the SMF shall reject the PDU session establishment by including a N1 SM container with a PDU Session Establishment Reject message (see clause 8.3.3 of TS 24.501 [25]) in the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response in step 17. Step 16 is skipped in this case and instead the SMF releases the N4 Session with UPF.\nIf the User Plane Enforcement Policy Notification in the N2 SM information indicates that no user plane resources could be established and the User Plane Enforcement Policy indicated \"required\" as described in clause 5.10.3 of TS 23.501 [2], the SMF shall reject the PDU session establishment by including a N1 SM container with a PDU Session Establishment Reject message (see clause 8.3.3 of TS 24.501 [25]) in the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response in step 17. Step 16 is skipped in this case.\nIf the N2 SM information includes a TL-Container with a get-response as described in clause 5.28a.2 of TS 23.501 [2], the SMF/CUC stores the information provided in the get-response.\n16a.\tThe SMF initiates an N4 Session Modification procedure with the UPF. The SMF provides AN Tunnel Info to the UPF as well as the corresponding forwarding rules.\nIf SMF decides to perform redundant transmission for one or more QoS Flows of the PDU, the SMF also indicates the UPF to perform packet duplication for the QoS Flow(s) in downlink direction by forwarding rules.\nIn the case of redundant transmission with two I-UPFs for one or more QoS Flows of the PDU, the SMF provides AN Tunnel Info to two I-UPFs and also indicates the UPF (PSA) to perform packet duplication for the QoS Flow(s) in downlink direction by forwarding rules. The SMF also provides the UL Tunnel Info of the UPF (PSA) to the two I-UPFs and the DL Tunnel Info of the two I-UPFs to the UPF (PSA).\nIf the N2 SM information includes the PDU Set Based Handling Support Indication, SMF configures PSA UPF to perform PDU Set information marking for the QoS flow as defined in clause 5.37.5.3 of TS 23.501 [2].\nNOTE 11:\tIf the PDU Session Establishment Request was due to mobility between 3GPP and non-3GPP access or mobility from EPC, the downlink data path is switched towards the target access in this step.\n16b.\tThe UPF provides an N4 Session Modification Response to the SMF.\nIf multiple UPFs are used in the PDU Session, the UPF in step 16 refers to the UPF terminating N3.\nAfter this step, the UPF delivers any down-link packets to the UE that may have been buffered for this PDU Session.\n16c.\tIf Request Type in step 3 indicates neither \"Emergency Request\" nor \"Existing Emergency PDU Session\" and if the SMF has not yet registered for this PDU Session, then the SMF registers with the UDM using Nudm_UECM_Registration (SUPI, DNN, S-NSSAI of HPLMN, PDU Session ID, SMF Identity, Serving Node PLMN ID, [NID]) for a given PDU Session. As a result, the UDM stores following information: SUPI, SMF identity and the associated DNN, S-NSSAI of HPLMN, PDU Session ID and Serving Network (PLMN ID, [NID], see clause 5.18 of TS 23.501 [2]). The UDM may further store this information in UDR by Nudr_DM_Update (SUPI, Subscription Data, UE context in SMF data). If the UDM has existing applicable event exposure subscriptions for events detected in SMF for this UE or any of the groups this UE belongs to (possibly retrieved from UDR), UDM invokes the Nsmf_EventExposure_Subscribe service for creating the event exposure subscriptions. If the SMF received Alternative S-NSSAI in step 3, the S-NSSAI provided to the UDM is the replaced S-NSSAI.\nIf the Request Type received in step 3 indicates \"Emergency Request\":\n-\tFor an authenticated non-roaming UE, based on operator configuration (e.g. related with whether the operator uses a fixed SMF for Emergency calls, etc.), the SMF may register in the UDM using Nudm_UECM_Registration (SUPI, PDU Session ID, SMF identity, Indication of Emergency Services) for a given PDU Session that is applicable for emergency services. As a result, the UDM shall store the applicable PDU Session for Emergency services.\n-\tFor an unauthenticated UE or a roaming UE, the SMF shall not register in the UDM for a given PDU Session.\n17.\tSMF to AMF: Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response (Cause).\nThe SMF may subscribe to the UE mobility event notification from the AMF (e.g. location reporting, UE moving into or out of Area Of Interest), after this step by invoking Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe service operation as specified in clause 5.2.2.3.2. For LADN, the SMF subscribes to the UE moving into or out of LADN service area event notification by providing the LADN DNN as an indicator for the Area Of Interest (see clause 5.6.5 and 5.6.11 of TS 23.501 [2]).\nIf SMF receives the indication in step 3 that \"the PDU Session is subject to LADN per LADN DNN and S-NSSAI\", the SMF subscribes to the UE moving into or out of LADN service area event notification by providing the LADN DNN and S-NSSAI as an indicator for the Area Of Interest.\nIf SMF receives the indication in step 3 that the PDU Session is subject to area restriction for the S-NSSAI, the SMF subscribe to \"UE mobility event notification\" event for reporting UE presence in Area of Interest by providing the S-NSSAI as an indicator for the Area Of Interest (see clauses 5.6.11 and 5.3.4.4 of TS 23.501 [2]).\nAfter this step, the AMF forwards relevant events subscribed by the SMF.\nFor those scenarios where the PCFs serving the AMF and the SMF are different, the SMF informs the AMF of the NWDAF ID(s) used for UE related Analytics and corresponding Analytics ID(s).\n18.\t[Conditional] SMF to AMF: Nsmf_PDUSession_SMContextStatusNotify (Release)\nIf during the procedure, any time after step 5, the PDU Session establishment is not successful, the SMF informs the AMF by invoking Nsmf_PDUSession_SMContextStatusNotify (Release). The SMF also releases any N4 session(s) created, any PDU Session address if allocated (e.g. IP address) and releases the association with PCF, if any. In this case, step 19 is skipped.\nFor a PDU Session for non-roaming subscribers, if the S-NSSAI of the PDU Session is subject to network slice usage control and there is no other PDU Session using the S-NSSAI over the same Access Type, the AMF starts the slice deregistration inactivity timer for the S-NSSAI over this Access Type as described in clause 5.15.15.3 of TS 23.501 [2].\n19.\tSMF to UE: In the case of PDU Session Type IPv6 or IPv4v6, the SMF generates an IPv6 Router Advertisement and sends it to the UE. If Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation is enabled for this PDU Session the SMF sends the IPv6 Router Advertisement via the AMF for transmission to the UE using the Mobile Terminated Data Transport in Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation procedures (see clause 4.24.2), otherwise the SMF sends the IPv6 Router Advertisement via N4 and the UPF.\n20.\tWhen the trigger for 5GS Bridge/Router information available is armed, then the SMF may initiate the SM Policy Association Modification as described in clause 4.16.5.1.\nSMF provides the 5GS Bridge/Router information (e.g. 5GS user-plane Node ID, port number for the PDU session, MAC address of the DS-TT Ethernet port for Ethernet PDU Session type, UE IP address for IP PDU Session type and UE-DS-TT Residence Time (if available) as provided by the UE) to PCF. In the case of Deterministic Networking, the SMF may also provide the MTU size for IPv4 or the MTU size for IPv6. If the SMF received a Port Management Information Container from either the UE or the UPF, then the SMF provides the Port Management Information Container and port number of the related port to the PCF as described in clause 5.28.3.2 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf the SMF has received User Plane Node Management Information from the UPF, then the SMF provides the User Plane Node Management Information Container to the PCF as part of 5GS Bridge/Router information and as described in clause 5.28.3.2 of TS 23.501 [2].\nTo support IEEE TSN, the TSN AF calculates the bridge delay for each port pair, i.e. composed of DS-TT Ethernet port and NW-TT Ethernet port, using the UE-DS-TT Residence Time for all NW-TT Ethernet port(s) serving the 5GS Bridge indicated by the 5GS user-plane Node ID. Additionally, the TSN AF determines the 5GS bridge delay for port pair composed of two DS-TT ports connecting to the same 5GS Bridge as sum of bridge delays related to PDU Sessions of the two DS-TT ports.\n21.\tIf the PDU Session establishment failed after step 4, the SMF shall perform the following:\nThe SMF unsubscribes to the modifications of Session Management Subscription data for the corresponding (SUPI, DNN, S-NSSAI of the HPLMN), using Nudm_SDM_Unsubscribe (SUPI, Session Management Subscription data, DNN, S-NSSAI of the HPLMN), if the SMF is no more handling a PDU Session of the UE for this (DNN, S-NSSAI of the HPLMN). The UDM may unsubscribe to the modification notification from UDR by Nudr_DM_Unsubscribe (SUPI, Subscription Data, Session Management Subscription data, S-NSSAI of the HPLMN, DNN).",

      "content": "This procedure is used in the case of home-routed roaming scenarios.\nFigure 4.3.2.2.2-1: UE-requested PDU Session Establishment for home-routed roaming scenarios\n1.\tThis step is the same as step 1 in clause 4.3.2.2.1.\n2.\tFor NR satellite access, the AMF may decide to verify the UE location as described in clause 5.4.11.4 of TS 23.501 [2].\nAs in step 2 of clause 4.3.2.2.1 except that, if the UE does not include an S-NSSAI in the PDU Session request, both a Serving PLMN S-NSSAI (in the Allowed NSSAI or Partially Allowed NSSAI) and its corresponding HPLMN S-NSSAI values are selected by the AMF. Also, the AMF in the serving PLMN selects both an SMF in the Serving PLMN using the S-NSSAI of the Serving PLMN mapping to the S-NSSAIs of the HPLMN used for the PDU Session and additionally, an SMF in the HPLMN using the S-NSSAI of the HPLMN used for the PDU Session, as described in clause 4.3.2.2.3. The AMF may also receive alternative H-SMFs from the NRF. If Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation is enabled for the PDU Session, the AMF selects V-SMF and H-SMF that supports the Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation (see clause 6.3.2 of TS 23.501 [2]). The AMF stores the association of the S-NSSAI(s), the DNN, the PDU Session ID, the SMF ID in VPLMN as well as Access Type of the PDU Session. Whether to perform DNN replacement is based on operator agreement.\nIn step 3 of clause 4.3.2.2.1, in local breakout roaming case, if V-SMF responds to AMF indicating that V-SMF is not able to process some part of the N1 SM information, the AMF proceeds with home routed case from this step and may select an SMF in the VPLMN different from the V-SMF selected earlier.\n3a.\tAs in step 3 of clause 4.3.2.2.1 with the addition that:\n-\tthe AMF also provides the identity of the H-SMF it has selected in step 2 and both the VPLMN S-NSSAI from the Allowed NSSAI or Partially Allowed NSSAI and the corresponding S-NSSAI of the HPLMN, which is in the mapping the VPLMN S-NSSAI from the Allowed NSSAI or Partially Allowed NSSAI. The H-SMF is provided when the PDU Session is home-routed. The AMF may also provide the identity of alternative H-SMFs, if it has received in step 2. If the AMF determines to replace the HPLMN S-NSSAI received from the UE with the HPLMN Alternative S-NSSAI or the AMF receives the HPLMN Alternative S-NSSAI and the HPLMN S-NSSAI provided by the UE, the AMF selects the H-SMF based on the HPLMN Alternative S-NSSAI.\n-\tThe V-SMF does not use DNN Selection Mode received from the AMF but relays this information to the H-SMF.\nIf the AMF is reusing an already established association with a V-SMF for the PDU Session ID provided by the UE (e.g. when Request Type indicates \"existing PDU Session\"), the AMF invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request.\nThe AMF may include the H-PCF ID in this step and V-SMF will pass it to the H-SMF in step 6. This will enable the H-SMF to select the same H-PCF in step 9a.\nIf Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation is used for the PDU Session and the \"Invoke NEF indication\" in the subscription data is set for the S-NSSAI / DNN combination, the AMF includes an \"Invoke NEF\" flag in Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request.\nIf Disaster Roaming service indication is received, the V-SMF stores the indication in PDU session context and includes the indication in charging data. V-SMF may also apply policy and charging control based on the indication according to roaming agreement.\n3b:\tThis step is the same as step 5 of clause 4.3.2.2.1. If the PDU Session Type is Unstructured and the V-SMF received an \"Invoke NEF\" flag in step 3a, then it skips steps 4 and 5.\n4.\tThe V-SMF selects a UPF in VPLMN as described in clause 6.3.3 of TS 23.501 [2].\n5.\tThe V-SMF initiates an N4 Session Establishment procedure with the selected V-UPF:\n5a.\tThe V-SMF sends an N4 Session Establishment Request to the V-UPF. The V-SMF provides Trace Requirements to the V-UPF if the V-SMF has received Trace Requirements from AMF. If V-SMF supports HR-SBO and receives HR-SBO allowed indication from AMF for this PDU session, V-SMF includes SUPI of the UE, HPLMN DNN and S-NSSAI, and an indication that the UE PDU session is working in HR-SBO mode.\n5b.\tThe V-UPF acknowledges by sending an N4 Session Establishment Response. The CN Tunnel Info is provided to V-SMF in this step.\n6.\tV-SMF to H-SMF: Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Request (SUPI, GPSI (if available), V-SMF SM Context ID, DNN, S-NSSAI with the value defined by the HPLMN, [HPLMN Alternative S-NSSAI], PDU Session ID, V-SMF ID, V-CN-Tunnel-Info, PDU Session Type, PCO, Number Of Packet Filters, User location information, Access Type, RAT Type, PCF ID, [Small Data Rate Control Status], SM PDU DN Request Container, DNN Selection Mode, Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation Indication, [Always-on PDU Session Requested], AMF ID, Serving Network, [ECS Address Configuration Information associated with PLMN ID of visited network], the QoS constraints from the VPLMN, Satellite backhaul category, Disaster Roaming service indication, [URSP rule enforcement reports]) or Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request (V-CN-Tunnel-Info, PCO, User location information, Access Type, RAT Type, SM PDU DN Request Container, Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation Indication, [Always-on PDU Session Requested], Serving Network, Satellite backhaul category, [URSP rule enforcement reports]). Protocol Configuration Options may contain information that H-SMF may needs to properly establish the PDU Session (e.g. SSC mode or SM PDU DN Request Container to be used to authenticate the UE by the DN-AAA as defined in clause 4.3.2.3). The H-SMF may use DNN Selection Mode when deciding whether to accept or reject the UE request. If the V-SMF does not receive any response from the H-SMF due to communication failure on the N16 interface, depending on operator policy the V-SMF may create the PDU Session to one of the alternative H-SMF(s) if additional H-SMF information is provided in step 3a, as specified in detail in TS 29.502 [36]. The Small Data Rate Control Status is included if received from the AMF. The Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation Indication is set by the V-SMF, if the PDU Session is intended for Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation. The QoS constraints from the VPLMN are specified in clause 5.7.1.11 of TS 23.501 [2]. The Disaster Roaming service indication is included if the indication is received from AMF in step 3a above.\nNOTE 1:\tThe QoS constraints from the VPLMN are provided by the VPLMN to avoid the risk that V-SMF rejects the PDU Session in step 13 when controlling SLA with the HPLMN.\nV-SMF SM Context ID contains the addressing information it has allocated for service operations related with this PDU Session. The H-SMF stores an association of the PDU Session and V-SMF Context ID for this PDU Session for this UE.\nIf the H-SMF needs to use V-SMF services for this PDU Session (invoking Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request) before step 13, at the first invocation of Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request the H-SMF provides the V-SMF with the H-SMF SM Context ID it has allocated for service operations related with this PDU Session.\nIf the RAT type was included in the message, then the H-SMF stores the RAT type in SM Context.\nECS Address Configuration Information associated with PLMN ID of visited network is an optional information that may only be provided when HR-SBO is supported for roamers of HPLMN.\nIf the V-SMF has an association with the H-SMF for the indicated PDU Session ID, the V-SMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request. Otherwise the V-SMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Request.\nIf the V-SMF receives the HPLMN Alternative S-NSSAI and the HPLMN S-NSSAI from the AMF, the V-SMF sends both the HPLMN Alternative S-NSSAI and the HPLMN S-NSSAI to the H-SMF.\nIf the V-SMF receives the URSP rule enforcement reports from UE, the V-SMF provides the URSP rule enforcement reports from roaming UE to H-SMF.\n7-12b.\tThese steps are the same as steps 4-10 in clause 4.3.2.2.1 with the following differences:\n-\tThese steps are executed in Home PLMN;\n-\tIf the S-NSSAI of this PDU Session is subject to network slice usage control, according to operator's policy the H-SMF configures the PDU Session inactivity timer in the H-UPF as described in clause 5.15.15 of TS 23.501 [2]. Otherwise, the H-SMF does not provides the inactivity timer to the H-UPF as described in step 10a in clause 4.3.2.2.1.\n-\tIf the QoS constraints from the VPLMN is provided in step 6 and PCF is deployed, the H-SMF provides the QoS constraints from the VPLMN to PCF. The PCF takes this into account when making policy decisions. In case dynamic PCC is not deployed, the SMF takes this into account when generating the default QoS rule.\n-\tStep 5 of clause 4.3.2.2.1 is not executed.\n-\tIf Disaster Roaming service indication is received, the SMF stores the indication in PDU session context and includes the indication in charging data. H-SMF may also apply policy and charging control based on the indication according to roaming agreement.\nWhen PCF is deployed, the SMF shall further report the PS Data Off status to PCF if the PS Data Off event trigger is provisioned, the additional behaviour of SMF and PCF for 3GPP PS Data Off is defined in TS 23.503 [20].\n12c.\tThis step is the same as step 16c in clause 4.3.2.2.1 with the following difference:\n-\tThe H-SMF registers for the PDU Session with the UDM using Nudm_UECM_Registration (SUPI, DNN, S-NSSAI with the value defined by the HPLMN, PDU Session ID).\n13.\tH-SMF to V-SMF: Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Response (QoS Rule(s), QoS Flow level QoS parameters if needed for the QoS Flow(s) associated with the QoS rule(s), PCO including session level information that the V-SMF is not expected to understand, selected PDU Session Type and SSC mode, Reliable Data Service Support, H-CN Tunnel Info, QFI(s), QoS profile(s), Session-AMBR, Reflective QoS Timer (if available), information needed by V-SMF in the case of EPS interworking such as the PDN Connection Type, User Plane Policy Enforcement, [ECS Address Configuration Information for the serving PLMN]).\nIf the PDU Session being established was requested to be an always-on PDU Session, the H-SMF shall indicate to the V-SMF whether the request is accepted or not via the Always-on PDU Session Granted indication in the response message to V-SMF. If the PDU Session being established was not requested to be an always-on PDU Session but the H-SMF determines that the PDU Session needs to be established as an always-on PDU Session, the H-SMF shall indicate it to the V-SMF by including Always-on PDU Session Granted indication that the PDU Session is an always-on PDU Session.\nThe information that the H-SMF may provide is the same than defined for step 11 of Figure 4.3.2.2.1-1.\nThe H-CN Tunnel Info contains the tunnel information for uplink traffic towards H-UPF.\nMultiple QoS Rules and QoS Flow level QoS parameters for the QoS Flow(s) associated with the QoS rule(s) may be included in the Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Response.\nThe V-SMF may apply VPLMN policies related with the SLA negotiated with the HPLMN or with QoS values supported by the VPLMN to evaluate the QoS parameters received from H-SMF; such policies may result in that V-SMF does not accept the PDU Session or does not accept some of the QoS Flows requested by the H-SMF. If the V-SMF does not accept the PDU Session, the V-SMF triggers the V-SMF initiated PDU Session Release procedure from step 1b-3b as defined in clause 4.3.4.3. When the V-SMF accepts at least one QoS flow, it transfers (via the AMF) the corresponding N2 (and NAS) request towards the 5G AN (and the UE) but does not issue requests for the QoS Flow(s) it has rejected due these policies. The V-SMF notifies the H-SMF about the rejected QoS Flows in step 23 below.\nNOTE 2:\tQoS enforcement in V-UPF is not expected on the QoS parameters received from H-SMF.\nIf Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation is enabled for the PDU Session, certain information, e.g. H-CN tunnel info, is not provided in the response to V-SMF.\nV-SMF stores the indication of Small Data Rate Control applicability on this PDU Session, if it is received in Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Response.\n13a-13b.\tThe V-SMF initiates an N4 Session Modification procedure with the V-UPF. The V-SMF may provide N4 rules to the V-UPF for this PDU Session, including rules to forward UL traffic to the H-UPF.\n14-18.\tThese steps are the same as steps 11-15 in clause 4.3.2.2.1 with the following differences:\n-\tThese steps are executed in Visited PLMN;\n-\tThe V-SMF stores an association of the PDU Session and H-SMF ID for this PDU Session for this UE;\n-\tIf the H-SMF indicates the PDU Session can be established as an always-on PDU Session, the V-SMF shall further check whether the PDU Session can be established as an always-on PDU Session based on local policies. The V-SMF notifies the UE whether the PDU Session is an always-on PDU Session or not via the Always-on PDU Session Granted indication in the PDU Session Establishment Accept message.\n-\tIf the N2 SM information indicates failure of user plane resource setup and the V-SMF rejected the PDU session establishment as described in step 15 in clause 4.3.2.2.1, step 19 is skipped and instead the V-SMF releases the N4 Session with V-UPF.\n-\tIf an alternative H-SMF is selected for the PDU Session and the corresponding selected alternative H-SMF ID has not been previously provided to the AMF, the V-SMF provides the selected alternative H-SMF ID to the AMF.\nNOTE 3:\tThe selected alternative H-SMF ID can be provided to AMF earlier, e.g. in step 8 if PDU Session Authentication/Authorization is performed.\n-\tIf Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation is enabled for the PDU Session, steps 19, 20 and 23 below are omitted.\n19a.\tThe V-SMF initiates an N4 Session Modification procedure with the V-UPF. The V-SMF may provide N4 rules to the V-UPF for this PDU Session, including rules to forward DL traffic to the AN.\n19b.\tThe V-UPF provides a N4 Session Modification Response to the V-SMF.\nAfter this step, the V-UPF delivers any down-link packets to the UE that may have been buffered for this PDU Session.\n20.\tThis step is the same as step 17 in clause 4.3.2.2.1 with the following differences:\n-\tThe SMF is a V-SMF. The H-SMF and V-SMF subscribe to UE reachability event from AMF.\n21.\tThis step is same as step 18 in clause 4.3.2.2.1. In addition, if during the procedure, after step 14, the PDU Session establishment is not successful as specified in step 15 of clause 4.3.2.2.1, the V-SMF triggers the V-SMF initiated PDU Session Release procedure from step 1b-3b as defined in clause 4.3.4.3.\n22.\tH-SMF to UE, via H-UPF and V-UPF in VPLMN: In the case of PDU Session Type IPv6 or IPv4v6, the H-SMF generates an IPv6 Router Advertisement and sends it to the UE via N4 and the H-UPF and V-UPF. If the Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation is enabled for this PDU session the V-UPF forwards the IPv6 Router Advertisement to the V-SMF for transmission to the UE using the Mobile Terminated Data Transport in Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation procedures (see clause 4.24.2).\n23.\tIf the V-SMF received in step18 an indication that the (R)AN has rejected some QFI(s) or if the V-SMF has rejected some QFI(s) in step 13, the V-SMF notifies the H-SMF via a Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request. The H-SMF is responsible of updating accordingly the QoS rules and QoS Flow level QoS parameters if needed for the QoS Flow(s) associated with the QoS rule(s) in the UE.\n24.\tThis step is the same as step 20 in clause 4.3.2.2.1 with the following differences:\n-\tthis step is executed in the Home PLMN;\n-\tthe SMF also deregisters for the given PDU Session using Nudm_UECM_Deregistration (SUPI, DNN, PDU Session ID). The UDM may update corresponding UE context by Nudr_DM_Update (SUPI, Subscription Data, UE context in SMF data).\nNOTE 4:\tThe SMF in HPLMN can initiate H-SMF initiated PDU Session Release procedure as defined in clause 4.3.4.3, already after step 13.",

      "content": "4.3.2.2.3.1\tGeneral\nThe SMF selection function, as described in clause 6.3.2 of TS 23.501 [2], is supported by the AMF and is used to allocate an SMF that manages the PDU Session.\nThe SMF selection function described in this clause does not apply to the selection of an SMF for Emergency services. For SMF selection for Emergency services is described in clause 5.16.4.5 of TS 23.501 [2].\nTwo main branches of deployment scenarios to consider:\n-\tNon-roaming and roaming with local breakout, see clause 4.3.2.2.3.2\n-\tHome routed roaming, see clause 4.3.2.2.3.3\nIn the case of non-roaming and local breakout, there are two operational scenarios dependent on the configuration of AMF and the deployment option of NSSF in the serving PLMN.\nIn the case of home-routed, there are two main options dependent on the operators' choices in terms of involvement of NRF, NSSF and configuration of AMF. The decision of which option to use is part of the roaming agreements.\nNOTE:\tThe use of NSI ID and the use of multiple NRFs in the network are optional and depend on the deployment choices of the operator.\n4.3.2.2.3.2\tNon-roaming and roaming with local breakout\nFigure 4.3.2.2.3.2-1: SMF selection for non-roaming and roaming with local breakout scenarios\nThis procedure may be skipped altogether if SMF information is available in the AMF by other means (e.g. locally configured); otherwise:\n-\twhen the serving AMF is aware of the appropriate NRF to be used to select NFs/services within the corresponding Network Slice instance based on configuration or based on the Network Slice selection information received during Registration, only steps 3 and 4 in the following procedure are executed as described in Figure 4.3.2.2.3.2-1;\n-\twhen the serving AMF is not aware of the appropriate NRF to be used to select NFs/services within the corresponding Network Slice instance, all steps in the following procedure are executed as described in Figure 4.3.2.2.3.2-1.\n1.\tThe AMF invokes the Nnssf_NSSelection_Get service operation from the NSSF in serving PLMN with the S-NSSAI of the Serving PLMN from the Allowed NSSAI or Partially Allowed NSSAI requested by the UE, PLMN ID of the SUPI, TAI of the UE and the indication that the request is within a procedure of PDU Session establishment in either the non-roaming or roaming with local breakout scenario.\n2.\tThe NSSF in serving PLMN selects the Network Slice instance, determines and returns the appropriate NRF to be used to select NFs/services within the selected Network Slice instance and optionally may return a NSI ID corresponding to the Network Slice instance.\n3.\tAMF queries the appropriate NRF in serving PLMN by issuing the Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request including at least the S-NSSAI of the Serving PLMN for this PDU Session from the Allowed NSSAI or Partially Allowed NSSAI, PLMN ID of the SUPI, DNN and possibly NSI ID if the AMF has stored an NSI ID for the S-NSSAI of the Serving PLMN for this PDU Session from the Allowed NSSAI or Partially Allowed NSSAI.\nNOTE:\tThe list of parameters for SMF selection is defined in clause 6.3.2 of TS 23.501 [2]. See also clause 5.34.3 of TS 23.501 [2] for I-SMF selection.\n4.\tThe NRF in serving PLMN provides to the AMF, e.g. FQDN or IP address, of a set of the discovered SMF instance(s) or Endpoint Address(es) of SMF service instance(s) in Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request response message and possibly an NSI ID for the selected Network Slice instance corresponding to the S-NSSAI for subsequent NRF queries.\n4.3.2.2.3.3\tHome routed roaming\nThe discovery and selection of the SMF in VPLMN is performed in the same way as for non-roaming and roaming with local breakout (see clause 4.3.2.2.3.2). The discovery and selection of the H-SMF in HPLMN is performed by means of either using NSSFs in VPLMN and HPLMN to discover a NRF in HPLMN (hNRF) or by having the hNRF configured in VPLMN. Which of these two options to use is based on local configuration in the VPLMN. The configuration depends on Service Level Agreements between the operators.\nNOTE 1:\tThe procedures described in this clause are not limited to SMF discovery and selection, but can be used to discover and select any NF/NF service in the HPLMN part of a Network Slice instance.\nThe discovery and selection of the H-SMF in HPLMN is performed by means of the procedure depicted in Figure 4.3.2.2.3.3-1 for the option where . NSSFs are used for hNRF discovery. In this case the steps 1 to 4 in Figure 4.3.2.2.3.3-1 are required. In the option where VPLMN are having hNRF configured, then NRF in VPLMN (vNRF) has the endpoint(s) of the Nnrf_NFdiscovery service(s) of the hNRF(s) as described in Figure 4.3.2.2.3.3-2.\nFigure 4.3.2.2.3.3-1: Option 1 for SMF selection for home-routed roaming scenarios\n1.\tBased on the operator's configuration, if the AMF is not aware of the appropriate NRF to be used to discover NFs/NF services in the HPLMN, the AMF invokes the Nnssf_NSSelection_Get service operation from the NSSF in VPLMN (vNSSF) with the VPLMN S-NSSAI from the Allowed NSSAI or Partially Allowed NSSAI requested by the UE for this PDU Session, the HPLMN S-NSSAI that maps to the VPLMN S-NSSAI, PLMN ID of the SUPI, the TAI of the UE and the indication that the request is within a procedure of PDU Session establishment in the home-routed roaming scenario.\n2.\tIf slicing configuration information for the S-NSSAI in the HPLMN is not available (e.g. the vNSSF has no cached information), the vNSSF invokes the Nnssf_NSSelection_Get service operation from NSSF of the HPLMN (hNSSF) according to the PLMN ID of the SUPI by including the HPLMN S-NSSAI. The vNSSF may be configured with the address(es) of the Nnssf_NSSelection_Get service(s) of the hNSSF.\n3.\tThe NSSF in HPLMN may include the NSI ID, if needed, for the Network Slice instance in HPLMN selected for the corresponding S-NSSAI of the HPLMN in the Nnssf_NSSelection_Get response. The NSSF in HPLMN also includes the appropriate hNRF to be used to discover NFs/NF services within HPLMN in the Nnssf_NSSelection_Get response.\n4.\tThe vNSSF includes in the Nnssf_NSSelection_Get response all the information that has been received from the NSSF in HPLMN in the response to the AMF.\nThe steps 5-8 below apply SMF discovery of the general procedure for NF/NF service discovery across PLMNs in the case of discovery made by NF service consumer defined in clause 4.17.5.\n5.\tThe AMF queries the vNRF using the Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request by including PLMN ID of the SUPI, DNN, HPLMN S-NSSAI, the hNRF (if discovered in steps 1-4 or cached) and possibly an HPLMN NSI ID for the selected Network Slice instance corresponding to the HPLMN S-NSSAI if available in the AMF (obtained from the HPLMN NSSF in steps 3 and 4 or cached from a previous H-NSSF query).\n6.\tThe vNRF invokes the Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request service operation from hNRF (address acquired in step 5, or configured) according the procedure in Figure 4.17.4-1 to get the NF profiles of candidate H-SMF instance(s) in the HPLMN. As the vNRF sends an Nnrf_NFDiscovery request on behalf of the AMF, the vNRF shall not replace the information of the requesting NF ID, i.e. AMF ID, in the Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request messag. If hNRF does not hold the NF profiles of the candidate H-SMF instances, hNRF may further interrogate other NRF(s) of the HPLMN to discovery H-SMF instances. For further information about NRF-NRF interactions, see clauses 5.3.2.2.4 and 5.3.2.2.5 of TS 29.510 [37].\n7-8. The hNRF provides to the AMF, via vNRF, the NF profiles of the discovered H-SMF instance(s) in Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request response message, which may also include an NSI ID for the selected Network Slice instance corresponding to the S-NSSAI of the HPLMN, which can be used for subsequent NRF queries.\nThe second option is depicted in Figure 4.3.2.2.3.3-2.\nFigure 4.3.2.2.3.3-2: Option 2 for SMF selection for home-routed roaming scenarios\n1.\tBased on the operator's configuration, the AMF queries the vNRF with PLMN ID of the SUPI, PLMN ID of the serving PLMN, DNN, the HPLMN S-NSSAI that maps to the S-NSSAI from the Allowed NSSAI or Partially Allowed NSSAI of the Serving PLMN the UE has requested, the endpoint(s) of the discovery service(s) of hNRF if available and if applicable and available, an HPLMN NSI ID (if the AMF has stored hNRF information and if applicable and available, an HPLMN NSI ID for the selected Network Slice instance corresponding to the S-NSSAI of the HPLMN) and DNN.\n2.\tThe vNRF queries, on behalf of the AMF in VPLMN, the hNRF identified by means of the PLMN ID of the SUPI (if no endpoint address of hNRF discovery service is received from the AMF, the vNRF detmines the endpoint address of hNRF based on local configuration using information received in step 1). The vNRF in VPLMN sends an Nnrf_NFDiscovery request to the hNRF according the procedure in Figure 4.17.4-1 to get the NF profiles of candidate H-SMF(s). As the vNRF sends an Nnrf_NFDiscovery request on behalf of the AMF, the vNRF shall not replace the information of the requesting NF, i.e. AMF ID, in the Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request message.\nThe steps 3a-3d below apply SMF discovery of the general procedure for NF/NF service discovery across PLMNs in the case of discovery made by NF service consumer defined in clause 4.17.5\nDepending on the available information and based on configuration, the hNRF may either execute steps in 3(A) or in 3(B).\n3(A)\tThe hNRF provides to the AMF, via vNRF, the NF profile(s) of the discovered SMF instance(s) and possibly an NSI ID for the selected HPLMN part of the Network Slice instance corresponding to the S-NSSAI of the HPLMN for subsequent NRF queries in Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request response message(steps 3a and 3b).\n3(B)\tThe hNRF queries, on behalf of the AMF, another NRF in HPLMN (e.g. a slice level NRF); this other NRF provides NF profiles of SMF instance(s) and possibly an NSI ID for the selected HPLMN part of the Network Slice instance corresponding to the S-NSSAI of the HPLMN for subsequent NRF queries (steps 3a and 3b) that the hNRF returns, via vNRF, to the AMF (steps 3c and 3d).\nNOTE 2:\tIn 3(B) the NF profile is provided by a second NRF, however the candidate NF profile(s) might reside in a third or fourth NRF etc. NRF-NRF interactions are described in clauses 5.3.2.2.4 and 5.3.2.2.5 of TS 29.510 [37].",

      "content": "The PDU Session establishment authentication/authorization is optionally triggered by the SMF during a PDU Session establishment and performed transparently via a UPF or directly with the DN-AAA Server without involving the UPF if the DN-AAA Server is located in the 5GC and reachable directly, as described in clause 5.6.6 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIn the case of Home Routed Roaming, unless specified otherwise, the SMF in the information flow defined in this clause is the H-SMF.\nFigure 4.3.2.3-1: PDU Session Establishment authentication/authorization by a DN-AAA Server\nNOTE 1:\tSteps 2, 3a, 3f and 4 are not defined in this specification. Steps 3 can be repeated depending on the mechanism used.\nNOTE 2:\tWhen the SMF directly communicates with the DN-AAA Server without involving the UPF, Step 1 is skipped and Step 2, 3a, 3f, 4 and 6 are executed without involving the UPF.\n0.\tThe SMF determines that it needs to contact the DN-AAA Server. The SMF identifies the DN-AAA Server based on local configuration or using the DN-specific identity (TS 33.501 [15]) provided by the UE inside the SM PDU DN Request Container provided by the UE in the PDU Session Establishment request or inside the EAP message in the PDU Session Authentication Complete message (TS 24.501 [25]).\nNOTE 3:\tThe content of the SM PDU DN Request Container is defined in TS 24.501 [25].\nNOTE 4:\tWhen secondary authentication, using Default UE credentials for secondary authentication, is used in the context of the UE onboarding architecture in Figure 5.30.2.10.2.2-3 of TS 23.501 [2], the DCS can act as the DN-AAA server.\n1.\tIf there is no existing N4 session that can be used to carry DN-related messages between the SMF and the DN, the SMF selects a UPF and triggers N4 session establishment.\n2.\tThe SMF initiates the authentication procedure with the DN-AAA via the UPF to authenticate the DN-specific identity provided by the UE as specified in TS 29.561 [63].\nWhen available, the SMF provides the GPSI in the signalling exchanged with the DN-AAA.\nThe UPF transparently relays the message received from the SMF to the DN-AAA Server.\n3a.\tThe DN-AAA Server sends an Authentication/Authorization message towards the SMF. The message is carried via the UPF.\n3b.\tTransfer of DN Request Container information received from DN-AAA towards the UE.\nIn non-roaming and LBO cases, the SMF invokes the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation on the AMF to transfer the DN Request Container information within N1 SM information sent towards the UE.\nIn the case of Home Routed roaming, the H-SMF initiates a Nsmf_PDUSession_Update service operation to request the V-SMF to transfer DN Request Container to the UE and the V-SMF invokes the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation on the AMF to transfer the DN Request Container information within N1 SM information sent towards the UE. In Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request, the H-SMF additionally includes the H-SMF SM Context ID.\n3c:\tThe AMF sends the N1 NAS message to the UE\n3d-3e.\tTransfer of DN Request Container information received from UE towards the DN-AAA.\nWhen the UE responds with a N1 NAS message containing DN Request Container information, the AMF informs the SMF by invoking the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext service operation. The SMF issues an Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext response.\nIn the case of Home Routed roaming, the V-SMF relays the N1 SM information to the H-SMF using the information of PDU Session received in step 3b via a Nsmf_PDUSession_Update service operation.\n3f:\tThe SMF (In HR case it is the H-SMF) sends the content of the DN Request Container information (authentication message) to the DN-AAA Server via the UPF.\nStep 3 may be repeated until the DN-AAA Server confirms the successful authentication/authorization of the PDU Session.\n4.\tThe DN-AAA Server confirms the successful authentication/authorization of the PDU Session. The DN-AAA Server may provide:\n-\tan SM PDU DN Response Container to the SMF to indicate successful authentication/authorization;\n-\tDN Authorization Data as defined in clause 5.6.6 of TS 23.501 [2];\n-\ta request to get notified with the IP address(es) allocated to the PDU Session and/or with N6 traffic routing information or MAC address(es) used by the UE for the PDU Session; and\n-\tan IP address (or IPV6 Prefix) for the PDU Session.\nThe N6 traffic routing information is defined in clause 5.6.7 of TS 23.501 [2].\nAfter the successful DN authentication/authorization, a session is kept between the SMF and the DN-AAA. If the SMF receives a DN Authorization Data, the SMF uses the DN Authorization Profile Index to apply the policy and charging control (see clause 5.6.6 of TS 23.501 [2]).\n5.\tThe PDU Session establishment continues and completes. In the step 7b of the Figure 4.3.2.2.1-1, if the SMF receives the DN Authorization Profile Index in DN Authorization Data from the DN-AAA, it sends the DN Authorization Profile Index to retrieve the PDU Session related policy information (described in clause 6.4 of TS 23.503 [20]) and the PCC rule(s) (described in clause 6.3 of TS 23.503 [20]) from the PCF. If the SMF receives the DN authorized Session AMBR in DN Authorization Data from the DN-AAA, it sends the DN authorized Session AMBR within the Session AMBR to the PCF to retrieve the authorized Session AMBR (described in clause 6.4 of TS 23.503 [20]). For PDU Session of Ethernet type, the SMF may instruct the UPF to handle VLAN information of the Ethernet frames related with the PDU Session received and sent on N6 or N19 or internal interface, as described in clause 5.6.10.2 of TS 23.501 [2].\n6.\tIf requested so in step 4 or if configured so by local policies, the SMF notifies the DN-AAA with the IP/MAC address(es) and/or with N6 traffic routing information allocated to the PDU Session together with the GPSI.\nLater on the SMF notifies the DN-AAA if the DN-AAA had requested to get notifications about:\n-\tallocation or release of an IPV6 Prefix for the PDU Session of IP type or addition or removal of source MAC addresses for the PDU Session of Ethernet type (e.g. using IPV6 multi-homing as defined in clause 5.6.4.3 of TS 23.501 [2]);\n-\tChange of N6 traffic routing information.\nWhen later on the PDU Session gets released as described in clause 4.3.4, the SMF notifies the DN-AAA.\nThe DN-AAA Server may revoke the authorization for a PDU Session or update DN authorization data for a PDU Session. According to the request from DN-AAA Server, the SMF may release or update the PDU Session.\nAt any time after the PDU Session establishment, the DN-AAA Server or SMF may initiate Secondary Re-authentication procedure for the PDU Session as specified in clause 11.1.3 of TS 33.501 [15]. Step 3a to step 3f are performed to transfer the Secondary Re-authentication message between the UE and the DN-AAA Server. The Secondary Re-authentication procedure may start from step 3a (DN-AAA initiated Secondary Re-authentication procedure) or step 3b (SMF initiated Secondary Re-authentication procedure). For the DN-AAA Server initiated Secondary Re-authentication, the message in step 3a shall include GPSI, if available and the IP/MAC address(es) of the PDU session, for SMF to identify the corresponding UE and PDU session. If the Re-authentication result is unsuccessful then SMF may release the PDU session and notify the DN-AAA Server.\nDuring Secondary Re-authentication, if the SMF receives an indication from the AMF that the UE is unreachable then it informs the DN-AAA Server that UE is not reachable for re-authentication. Based on this indication from SMF, the DN-AAA Server may decide to keep the PDU Session or request to release the PDU session.\nDN-AAA may initiate DN-AAA Re-authorization without performing re-authentication based on local policy. DN-AAA Re-authorization procedure may start from step 4.\nDuring Secondary Re-authentication/Re-authorization, if the SMF receives DN Authorization Profile Index and/or DN authorized Session AMBR, the SMF reports the received value(s) to the PCF (as described in TS 23.501 [2]) by triggering the Policy Control Request Trigger as described in TS 23.503 [20].",

The corresponding high level end to end signalling flow is described in this clause and further refined in TS 29.561 [63]. For the procedure described below, it is a prerequisite that the UE is already registered to the 5GC and both SMF and UPF support the L2TP feature.\nNOTE 1:\tThe scenario where the UE sends actual PPP frames/signalling towards the LAC, which involves back and forth message exchanges between the UE and LAC, for example for LCP Negotiation, is not in the scope of the present document.\nNOTE 2:\tThe UE does not need to be aware of the L2TP procedure.\nFigure 4.3.2.4-1: Support of L2TP\n1.\tThis step is the same as step 1 in clause 4.3.2.2.1 or step 1 in clause 4.3.2.2.2.\nThe PDU session establishment may include in the PCO information authentication information for PAP and/or CHAP.\n2.\tThe SMF may determine that an L2TP session is required for the PDU Session based on local configuration (e.g. related with DNN/S-NSSAI).

      "content": "The UE or network requested PDU Session Modification procedure (non-roaming and roaming with local breakout scenario) is depicted in figure 4.3.3.2-1.\nFigure 4.3.3.2-1: UE or network requested PDU Session Modification (for non-roaming and roaming with local breakout)\n1.\tThe procedure may be triggered by following events:\n1a.\t(UE initiated modification) The UE initiates the PDU Session Modification procedure by the transmission of an NAS message (N1 SM container (PDU Session Modification Request (PDU session ID, Packet Filters, Operation, Requested QoS, Segregation, 5GSM Core Network Capability, Number Of Packet Filters, [URSP rule enforcement reports], [Always-on PDU Session Requested], [Requested Non-3GPP Delay Budget])), PDU Session ID, UE Integrity Protection Maximum Data Rate, [Port Management Information Container]) message. Depending on the Access Type, if the UE was in CM-IDLE state, this SM-NAS message is preceded by the Service Request procedure. The NAS message is forwarded by the (R)AN to the AMF with an indication of User location Information. The AMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext (SM Context ID, N1 SM container (PDU Session Modification Request)).\nWhen the UE requests specific QoS handling for selected SDF(s), the PDU Session Modification Request includes Packet Filters describing the SDF(s), the requested Packet Filter Operation (add, modify, delete) on the indicated Packet Filters, the Requested QoS and optionally a Segregation indication. The Segregation indication is included when the UE recommends to the network to bind the applicable SDF(s) on a distinct and dedicated QoS Flow e.g. even if an existing QoS Flow can support the requested QoS. The network should abide by the UE request, but is allowed to proceed instead with binding the selected SDF(s) on an existing QoS Flow.\nNOTE 1:\tOnly one QoS Flow is used for traffic segregation. If UE makes subsequent requests for segregation of additional SDF(s), the additional SDF(s) are multiplexed on the existing QoS Flow that is used for segregation.\nThe UE shall not trigger a PDU Session Modification procedure for a PDU Session corresponding to a LADN when the UE is outside the area of availability of the LADN.\nThe PS Data Off status, if changed, shall be included in the PCO in the PDU Session Modification Request message.\nFor a PDU Session which was established in the EPS, when the UE moves from EPS to 5GS for the first time, the UE includes an Always-on PDU Session Requested indication in the PDU Session Modification Request message if it wants to change the PDU Session to an always-on PDU Session.\nIf UE supports to report URSP rule enforcement to network, when the UE associates a newly detected application to an existing PDU Session based on URSP evaluation result and the matched URSP rule included the Indication for reporting URSP rule enforcement, the UE may initiate PDU Session Modification procedure to provide URSP rule enforcement report as described in clause 6.6.2.4 of TS 23.503 [20].\nWhen PCF is deployed, the SMF shall further report the PS Data Off status to PCF if the PS Data Off event trigger is provisioned, the additional behaviour of SMF and PCF for 3GPP PS Data Off is defined in TS 23.503 [20].\nThe 5GSM Core Network Capability is provided by the UE and handled by SMF as defined in clause 5.4.4b of TS 23.501 [2].\nThe UE Integrity Protection Maximum Data Rate indicates the maximum data rate up to which the UE can support UP integrity protection. It is set as defined in TS 23.501 [2].\nThe Number Of Packet Filters indicates the number of supported packet filters for signalled QoS rules as described in clause 5.17.2.2.2 of TS 23.501 [2].\nWhen it moves from EPS to 5GS for the first time, a UE that supports EAS re-discovery as described in clause 6.2.3.3 of TS 23.548 [74], may indicate so in the PCO.\nWhen it moves from EPS to 5GS for the first time, a UE that hosts the EDC functionality shall indicate in the PCO its capability to support the EDC functionality (see clause 5.2.1 of TS 23.548 [74]).\nPort Management Information Container may be received from DS-TT and includes DS-TT port related management information as defined in clause 5.28.3 of TS 23.501 [2].\n1b.\t(PCF initiated SM Policy Association Modification) The PCF performs a PCF initiated SM Policy Association Modification procedure as defined in clause 4.16.5.2 to notify SMF about the modification of policies. This may e.g. have been triggered by a policy decision or upon AF requests, e.g. Application Function influence on traffic routing as described in step 5 in clause 4.3.6.2 or AF to provide Port management information Container.\nIf QoS Monitoring is requested by the AF, the PCF generates the QoS Monitoring policy for the corresponding service data flow and provides the policy in the PCC rules to the SMF in this step.\nIf Periodicity is provided by the AF, the PCF provides the Periodicity information in the PCC rules. Based on operator's local policies, the PCF sends to the SMF an indication in the PCC Rule to perform N6 Traffic Parameter Measurements for N6 Jitter and, if not received from the AF, also UL and/ or DL Periodicity measurements.\nThe PCF may provision a PDU Set Control Information and Protocol Description as described in clause 6.1.3.27.4 of TS 23.503 [20] within PCC Rules based on the information provided by the AF and/or the local operator policies.\nThe PCF may provision a Data Burst Handing Information and DL Protocol Description as described in clause 6.3.1 of TS 23.503 [20] within PCC Rules based on the information provided by the AF and/or the local operator policies.\n1c.\t(SMF requested modification) The UDM updates the subscription data of SMF by Nudm_SDM_Notification (SUPI, Session Management Subscription Data). The SMF updates the Session Management Subscription Data and acknowledges the UDM by returning an Ack with (SUPI).\n1d.\t(SMF requested modification) The SMF may decide to modify PDU Session. This procedure also may be triggered based on locally configured policy or triggered from the (R)AN (see clause 4.2.6 and clause 4.9.1). It may also be triggered if the UP connection is activated (as described in Service Request procedure) and the SMF has marked that the status of one or more QoS Flows are deleted in the 5GC but not synchronized with the UE yet. It may also be triggered to update QoS profile in the NG RAN and PDU Set information marking in the PSA UPF upon completion of mobility procedure as defined in clause 5.37.5.3 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf interworking with TSN deployed in the transport network is supported and either the UPF supports CN-TL or NG-RAN supports AN-TL (see clause 4.4.8 of TS 23.501 [2]), the procedure may be triggered due to reception of Status group from TN CNC.\nThe SMF may decide to modify PDU Session to send updated ECS Address Configuration Information to the UE as defined in clause 6.5.2 of TS 23.548 [74].\nThe SMF may decide to modify PDU Session to send updated DNS server address to the UE as defined in clause 6.2.3.2.3 of TS 23.548 [74].\nThe SMF may decide to modify PDU Session to send the EAS rediscovery indication to the UE as defined in clause 6.2.3.3 of TS 23.548 [74].\nIf the SMF receives one of the triggers in step 1b ~ 1d, the SMF starts SMF requested PDU Session Modification procedure.\n1e.\t(AN initiated modification) (R)AN shall indicate to the SMF when the AN resources onto which a QoS Flow is mapped are released irrespective of whether notification control is configured. (R)AN sends the N2 message (PDU Session ID, N2 SM information) to the AMF. The N2 SM information includes the QFI, User location Information and an indication that the QoS Flow is released. The AMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext (SM Context ID, N2 SM information).\n(AN initiated notification control) If notification control is configured for a GBR QoS Flow, (R)AN sends a N2 message (PDU Session ID, N2 SM information) to SMF when the (R)AN decides the QoS targets of the QoS Flow cannot be fulfilled or can be fulfilled again, respectively. The N2 SM information includes the QFI and an indication that the QoS targets for that QoS Flow cannot be fulfilled or can be fulfilled again, respectively. When QoS targets cannot be fulfilled, the N2 SM information indicates a reference to the Alternative QoS Profile matching the values of the QoS parameters that the NG-RAN is currently fulfilling as specified in clause 5.7.2.4 of TS 23.501 [2]. If the QoS Flow has a TSCAI including Capability for BAT adaptation and without Burst Arrival Time, the N2 SM information can also include a BAT offset as described in clause 5.27.2.5 of TS 23.501 [2]. The AMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext (SM Context ID, N2 SM information). If the PCF has subscribed to the event, SMF reports this event to the PCF for each PCC Rule for which notification control is set in step 2.\n1f.\t(AMF initiated modification) If the UE supports CE mode B and use of CE mode changes from restricted to unrestricted or vice versa in the Enhanced Coverage Restriction information in the UE context in the AMF and the UE has already established PDU sessions, then the AMF shall trigger a PDU session modification to the SMFs serving the UE's PDU sessions when the AMF determines that NAS-SM timer shall be updated due to the change of Enhanced Coverage Restriction and include the extended NAS-SM indication only if use of CE mode B is now unrestricted in the Enhanced Coverage Restriction information in the UE context in the AMF.\nIf the AMF, based on configuration, is aware that the UE is accessing over a gNB using GEO satellite backhaul and GEO Satellite ID needs to be updated to the SMF, the AMF may, based on configuration, include the latest GEO Satellite ID as described in clause 5.43.2 of TS 23.501 [2].\n1g.\t(AMF initiated modification) the AMF informs the SMF of updates of the NWDAF ID(s) used for UE related Analytics and corresponding Analytics ID(s). Also, If the PCF provided PCF binding information and Request for notification of SM Policy Association establishment and termination and there is any PDU Session established to that DNN, S-NSSAI [PCF binding information, Request for notification of SM Policy Association establishment and termination].\n1h.\t(AMF initiated modification) When the AMF determines that the S-NSSAI is to be replaced with an Alternative S-NSSAI (as described in clause 5.15.19 of TS 23.501 [2]), the AMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request (SM Context ID, S-NSSAI, Alternative S-NSSAI) to the SMF of the PDU session associated with the S-NSSAI.\n(AMF initiated modification) When the AMF determines that the S-NSSAI is subject to area restriction, e.g. when the S-NSSAI is configured with an NS-AoS, or when the S-NSSAI is present in the Partially Allowed NSSAI, the AMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request (SM Context ID, S-NSSAI, Slice Area Restriction indication) to the SMF indicating that the PDU Session is subject to area restriction for the S-NSSAI. If the S-NSSAI is replaced with the Alternative S-NSSAI, the AMF checks the area restriction only for the Replaced S-NSSAI for this PDU Session.\nBased on the extended NAS-SM timer indication, the SMF shall use the extended NAS-SM timer setting for the UE as specified in TS 24.501 [25].\n2.\tThe SMF may need to report some subscribed event to the PCF by performing an SMF initiated SM Policy Association Modification procedure as defined in clause 4.16.5.1. This step may be skipped if PDU Session Modification procedure is triggered by step 1b or 1d. If dynamic PCC is not deployed, the SMF may apply local policy to decide whether to change the QoS profile.\nThe PCF may make policy control decisions based on the awareness of URSP rule enforcement, as described in clause 6.1.1.5 in TS 23.503 [20].\nSteps 2a to 7 are not invoked when the PDU Session Modification requires only action at a UPF (e.g. gating).\n2a.\tThe SMF may update the UPF with N4 Rules related to new or modified QoS Flow(s).\nNOTE 2:\tThis allows the UL packets with the QFI of a new or modified QoS Flow to be transferred.\nIf the SMF initiated the PDU Session Modification procedure in step 1b due to PCF initiated SM Policy Association Modification that adds one or more PCC Rule(s) with a TSC Assistance Container and if interworking with TSN deployed in the transport network is supported, the SMF may instruct the UPF to assign or remove a distinct N3 tunnel end point address for the QoS Flow(s) assigned with a TSC Assistance Container.\nIf the SMF initiated the PDU Session Modification procedure in step 1d due to reception of Status group from TN CNC, the SMF includes a TL-Container with a set-request to the N4 Session Modification request that is sent to the UPF, as described in clause 5.28a.2 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf the SMF initiated the PDU Session Modification procedure in step 1b due to PCF initiated SM Policy Association Modification that adds one or more PCC Rule(s) with UL and/or DL Periodicity, the SMF composes the TSCAI with the periodicity information.\nIf the SMF initiated the PDU Session Modification procedure in step 1b due to PCF initiated SM Policy Association Modification that adds one or more PCC Rule(s) with an indication to perform N6 Traffic Parameter measurements (e.g. the N6 Jitter range associated with the DL Periodicity, and the UL/DL periodicity), the SMF instructs the UPF to perform N6 Traffic Parameter measurement associated with the DL Periodicity for the QoS Flow, as described in clause 5.37.8.2 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf N6 Traffic Parameter measurements are requested and DL Periodicity is received in the PCC Rule, the SMF shall include the DL Periodicity as well as the indication of N6 Traffic Parameter measurement in the request to the UPF, see clause 5.8.5.11 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf the PCC Rule includes a Protocol Description and PDU Set QoS parameters for DL and the SMF decides to enable PDU Set Identification and marking for PDU Set based Handling by PSA UPF, the SMF should provide the Protocol Description information and PDU Set Marking indication to the UPF and request the UPF to mark the PDU Set Information in each PDU belonging to the PDU Sets as described in clause 5.37.5.2 and 5.8.5.4 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf the SMF decides to enable End of Data Burst marking by PSA UPF, the SMF should request the UPF to mark End of Data Burst as described in clause 5.37.8.3 of TS 23.501 [2] . If the PCC Rule includes a Protocol Description, the SMF should provide the Protocol Description information to the UPF.\nIf the PDU Set information marking has been activated in the UPF for a QoS flow, the SMF may request the UPF to stop the marking of the PDU Set information based on the indication from the RAN or PCF, e.g. if the Target RAN does not support the PDU Set based handling as described in clause 5.37.5.3 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf the PCF initiated SM Policy Association Modification that adds one or more PCC Rule(s) with PDU Set Control Information, the SMF performs PDU Set based QoS handling, see clause 5.37.5 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf redundant transmission has not been activated to the PDU session and the SMF decides to perform redundant transmission for the QoS Flow, the SMF indicates to the UPF to perform packet duplication and elimination for the QoS Flow.\nIf redundant transmission has been activated on the PDU Session and the SMF decides to stop redundant transmission, the SMF indicates the UPF to release the CN Tunnel Info which is used as the redundancy tunnel of the PDU Session and also indicates the UPF to stop packet duplication and elimination for the corresponding QoS Flow(s).\nNOTE 3:\tThe method to perform elimination and reordering on RAN/UPF based on the packets received from the two GTP-U tunnels is up to RAN/UPF implementation. The two GTP-U tunnels are terminated at the same RAN node and UPF.\nIf redundant transmission has not been activated to the PDU Session and the SMF decides to perform redundant transmission for the QoS Flow with two I-UPFs between the PSA UPF and the NG-RAN, the SMF sends a N4 Session Establishment Request message to the I-UPFs including UL CN Tunnel Info of the PSA UPF and a request to allocate CN Tunnel Info.\nSMF may make use of Redundant Transmission Experience analytics provided by NWDAF, when SMF takes a decision whether to perform redundant transmission, or stop redundant transmission if it had been activated, as described in clause 6.13 of TS 23.288 [50].\nIf the AMF initiated the PDU Session Modification procedure in step 1h due to network slice replacement with the Alternative S-NSSAI and if the SMF determines that the PDU Session is retained, the SMF sends N4 Session Modification request message to the UPF to replace the S-NSSAI with the Alternative S-NSSAI, as described in clause 5.15.19 of TS 23.501 [2].\n2b.\tThe UPF(s) respond to the SMF. If redundant transmission has not been activated to the PDU session and the SMF indicated the UPF to perform packet duplication and elimination for the QoS Flow in step 2a, the UPF allocates an additional CN Tunnel Info. The additional CN Tunnel Info is provided to the SMF.\nIf redundant transmission has not been activated to the PDU Session and the SMF decides to perform redundant transmission for the QoS Flow with two I-UPFs in step 2a, the UPFs allocate CN Tunnel Info. The CN Tunnel Info of each I-UPF is provided to the SMF.\nIf interworking with TSN deployed in the transport network is supported and the UPF supports CN-TL and received a TL-Container with a set-request from the SMF/CUC in step 2a (see clause 4.4.8 of TS 23.501 [2]), the UPF/CN-TL includes a TL-Container with a set-response to the N4 Session Modification response, as described in clause 5.28a.2 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf requested by SMF in step 2a, the PSA UPF will initiate N4 Session Level reporting for N6 Traffic Parameter Measurement Report as described in clause 4.4.2.2. If N6 Traffic Parameter(s) are available then the response to the SMF in this step may include the N6 Traffic Parameter(s) (e.g., the N6 Jitter range associated with the DL Periodicity, and the UL/DL periodicity) for the QoS Flow (see clause 5.37.8.2 of TS 23.501 [2]). The SMF composes the TSCAI with the received N6 Traffic Parameters.\n3a.\tFor UE or AN initiated modification or AMF initiated modification, the SMF responds to the AMF through Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response ([N2 SM information (PDU Session ID, QFI(s), QoS Profile(s), [Alternative QoS Profile(s)], Session-AMBR], [CN Tunnel Info(s)]), N1 SM container (PDU Session Modification Command (PDU Session ID, QoS rule(s) and associated UL Protocol Description(s) (if available), QoS rule operation, QoS Flow level QoS parameters if needed for the QoS Flow(s) associated with the QoS rule(s), Session-AMBR, [Always-on PDU Session Granted], [Port Management Information Container], [Non-3GPP QoS Assistance Information Container]))). See clause 5.7 of TS 23.501 [2] for the QoS Profile, Alternative QoS Profile and QoS rule and QoS Flow level QoS parameters. Alternative QoS Profile is only valid for AN initiated modification.\nIf the PDU Session Modification was requested by the UE to modify a PDU Session to an always-on PDU Session, the SMF shall include an Always-on PDU Session Granted indication in the PDU Session Modification Command to indicate whether the PDU Session is to be changed to an always-on PDU Session or not via the Always-on PDU Session Granted indication in the PDU Session Modification Command.\nThe N2 SM information carries information that the AMF shall provide to the (R)AN. It may include the QoS profiles and the corresponding QFIs to notify the (R)AN that one or more QoS flows were added, or modified. It may include only QFI(s) to notify the (R)AN that one or more QoS flows were removed. The SMF may indicate for each QoS Flow whether redundant transmission shall be performed by a corresponding redundant transmission indicator. If the SMF decides to activate redundant transmission in step 2a, the SMF includes the allocated additional CN Tunnel Info in the N2 SM information. If the SMF decides to perform redundant transmission for new QoS Flow with two I-UPFs in step 2a, the SMF includes the allocated CN Tunnel Info of the two I-UPFs in the N2 SM information. If the PDU Session Modification was triggered by the (R)AN Release in step 1e the N2 SM information carries an acknowledgement of the (R)AN Release. If the PDU Session Modification was requested by the UE for a PDU Session that has no established User Plane resources, the N2 SM information provided to the (R)AN includes information for establishment of User Plane resources. For Network Slice Replacement if the SMF determines that the PDU Session is to be retained, the S-NSSAI in N2 SM information is set to Alternative S-NSSAI.\n-\tIf the SMF has received a Requested Non-3GPP Delay Budget for a QoS flow from the PEGC, the SMF may adjust the dynamic CN PDB signalled to the NG-RAN as defined in clause 5.44.3.4 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf redundant transmission has been activated on the PDU Session and the SMF decides to stop redundant transmission in step 2a, the SMF indicates the (R)AN to release the AN Tunnel and stop packet duplication and elimination associated with the redundancy tunnel of the PDU Session.\nThe N1 SM container carries the PDU Session Modification Command that the AMF shall provide to the UE. It may include the QoS rules and associated UL Protocol Description(s) (if available), QoS Flow level QoS parameters if needed for the QoS Flow(s) associated with the QoS rule(s) and corresponding QoS rule operation and QoS Flow level QoS parameters operation to notify the UE that one or more QoS rules were added, removed or modified. If the PCF provides the PCC rules with Protocol Description for UL in step 1b or step 2, based on operator policy, the SMF may additionally provide the Protocol Description for UL with the associated QoS rule as described in clause 5.37.5.1 of TS 23.501 [2].\nFor the AMF initiated the PDU Session Modification procedure in step 1h due to network slice replacement, and if the SMF determines that the PDU Session is to be retained, the SMF includes the Alternative S-NSSAI in the PDU Session Modification Command to the UE and a cause value indicating that the S-NSSAI of the PDU Session is replaced with the Alternative S-NSSAI.\nIf the AMF initiated the PDU Session Modification procedure in step 1h due to network slice replacement and if the PDU Session is SSC mode 3 and if the SMF determines that the PDU Session is to be re-established on the Alternative S-NSSAI, the SMF includes the Alternative S-NSSAI in the PDU Session Modification Command to the UE and a cause value indicating that a PDU Session re-establishment on the Alternative S-NSSAI is required. The UE re-establishes a new PDU Session on the Alternative S-NSSAI, as described in clause 5.15.19 in TS 23.501 [2]. If the PDU Session is SSC mode 1 or SSC mode 2, the SMF may initiate release of the PDU Session as described in clause 4.3.4.2.\nIf port number and a Port Management Information Container have been received from PCF in Step 2 and the port number matches the port number assigned for the DS-TT port for this PDU session, then SMF includes the Port Management Information Container in the N1 SM container.\nThe SMF may need to send transparently through NG-RAN the PDU Session Modification Command to inform the UE about changes in the QoS parameters (i.e. 5QI, GFBR, MFBR) that the NG-RAN is currently fulfilling after the SMF receives QoS Notification Control as defined in clause 5.7.2.4 of TS 23.501 [2]. When the SMF sends on the PDU Session Modification Command transparently through NG-RAN, the N2 SM information is not included as part of the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer.\nIf the UE indicated in the PCO that it supports the EDC functionality, the SMF may indicate to the UE either that the use of the EDC functionality is allowed for the PDU Session or that the use of the EDC functionality is required for the PDU Session (see clause 5.2.1 of TS 23.548 [74]).\nBased on the S-NSSAI and DNN for PIN, the SMF may provide the UE with per QoS-flow Non-3GPP QoS Assistance Information in the N1 SM container.\nIf SMF receives the indication indicating that the PDU Session is subject to area restriction for the S-NSSAI, and if SMF has not subscribed before, the SMF subscribes to \"UE mobility event notification\" event for reporting UE presence in Area of Interest by providing the S-NSSAI as an indicator for the Area Of Interest (see clauses 5.6.11 and 5.3.4.4 of TS 23.501 [2]).\nIf SMF does not receive the indication indicating that the PDU Session is subject to area restriction for the S-NSSAI, and if the SMF has subscribed the \"UE mobility event notification\" event in the AMF before, the SMF may unsubscribe \"UE mobility event notification\" event in the AMF.\n3b.\tFor SMF requested modification, the SMF invokes Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer ([N2 SM information] (PDU Session ID, QFI(s), QoS Profile(s), [Alternative QoS Profile(s)], Session-AMBR, [CN Tunnel Info(s)], QoS Monitoring indication, QoS Monitoring reporting frequency, QoS monitoring parameter), [TSCAI(s)], TL-Container(s), [ECN marking for L4S indicator(s)]), N1 SM container (PDU Session Modification Command (PDU Session ID, QoS rule(s) and associated UL Protocol Description(s) (if available), QoS Flow level QoS parameters if needed for the QoS Flow(s) associated with the QoS rule(s), QoS rule operation and QoS Flow level QoS parameters operation, Session-AMBR, [Port Management Information Container]))).\n-\tFor each QoS Flow, the SMF may at most request one of the following to the NG-RAN:\n-\tECN marking for L4S indicator at NG-RAN in the case of ECN marking for L4S in RAN as described in clause 5.37.3 of TS 23.501 [2]; or\n-\tCongestion information monitoring as described in clauses 5.45.3 and 5.37.4 of TS 23.501 [2]; or\n-\tprovide information for ECN marking for L4S at UPF in the case of ECN marking for L4S by PSA UPF as described in clause 5.37.3 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf the SMF initiated the PDU Session Modification procedure in step 1b due to PCF initiated SM Policy Association Modification that adds one or more PCC Rule(s) with a TSC Assistance Container and if interworking with TSN deployed in the transport network is supported, the SMF may instruct the NG-RAN to assign or remove a distinct N3 tunnel end point address for the QoS Flow(s) assigned with a TSC Assistance Container.\nThe SMF may indicate for each QoS Flow whether redundant transmission shall be performed by a corresponding redundant transmission indicator. If the SMF decides to activate redundant transmission in step 2a, the SMF includes the allocated additional CN Tunnel Info in the N2 SM information. If the SMF decides to perform redundant transmission for new QoS Flow with two I-UPFs in step 2a, the SMF includes the allocated CN Tunnel Info of the two I-UPFs in the N2 SM information.\nIf redundant transmission has been activated on the PDU Session and the SMF decides to stop redundant transmission in step 2a, the SMF indicates the (R)AN to release the AN Tunnel and stop packet duplication and elimination associated with the redundancy tunnel of the PDU Session.\nIf port number and a Port Management Information Container have been received from PCF in step 1b and the port number matches the port number assigned for the DS-TT port for this PDU session, then SMF includes the Port Management Information Container in the N1 SM container.\nThe SMF indicates the request for QoS Monitoring for the QoS Flow according to the information received from the PCF in step 1b, or based on SMF local policy, e.g. when the RAN rejected the creation of a specific QoS Flow. In the case of receiving the QoS Monitoring indication, the RAN enables the RAN part of UL/DL packet delay measurement for the QoS Flow and the QoS Monitoring reporting frequency is used by RAN to determine the packet delay measurement frequency of the RAN part. In the case of receiving a congestion information request, RAN initiates reporting of UL and/or DL QoS Flow congestion information to PSA UPF as defined in clause 5.45.3 of TS 23.501 [2]. The TSCAI is defined in clause 5.27.2 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf the SMF initiated the PDU Session Modification procedure in step 1d due to reception of Status group from TN CNC, the SMF includes a TL-Container with a set-request to the N2 SM information, as described in clause 5.28a.2 of TS 23.501 [2].\nThe SMF indicates EAS rediscovery indication to the UE, if that initiated the PDU Session Modification procedure in step 1d as defined in clause 6.2.3.3 of TS 23.548 [74].\nIf the UE is in CM-IDLE state and an ATC is activated, the AMF updates and stores the UE context based on the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer and steps 4, 5, 6 and 7 are skipped. When the UE is reachable e.g. when the UE enters CM-CONNECTED state, the AMF forwards the N1 message to synchronize the UE context with the UE.\nIf the PCF provides the PCC rules with Protocol Description for UL in step 1b or step 2, based on operator policy, the SMF may provide the Protocol Description(s) for UL with the associated QoS rule(s) as described in clause 5.37.5.1 of TS 23.501 [2].\n3c.\tFor SMF requested modification due to updated SMF-Associated parameters from the UDM, the SMF may provide the SMF derived CN assisted RAN parameters tuning to the AMF. The SMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_SMContextStatusNotify (SMF derived CN assisted RAN parameters tuning) towards the AMF. The AMF stores the SMF derived CN assisted RAN parameters tuning in the associated PDU Session context for this UE.\n3d.\tFor SMF requested modification due to updated NWDAF ID, the SMF informs the AMF of updates of the NWDAF ID(s) used for UE related Analytics and corresponding Analytics ID(s).\n4.\tThe AMF may send N2 ([N2 SM information received from SMF], NAS message (PDU Session ID, N1 SM container (PDU Session Modification Command))) Message to the (R)AN.\n5.\tThe (R)AN may issue AN specific signalling exchange with the UE that is related with the information received from SMF. For example, in the case of a NG-RAN, an RRC Connection Reconfiguration may take place with the UE modifying the necessary (R)AN resources related to the PDU Session or if only N1 SM container is received in step 4 from AMF, RAN transports only the N1 SM container to the UE.\nThe (R)AN may consider the updated CN assisted RAN parameters tuning to reconfigure the AS parameters.\nAs part of this, the N1 SM container is provided to the UE. If the N1 SM container includes a Port Management Information Container then the UE provides the container to DS-TT.\nIf new DNS server address is provided to the UE in the PCO, the UE can refresh all EAS(s) information (e.g. DNS cache) bound to the PDU Session, based on UE implementation as described in clause 6.2.3.2.3 of TS 23.548 [74].\nIf EAS rediscovery indication is provided to the UE, the UE can trigger EAS rediscovery procedure as defined in clause 6.2.3.3 of TS 23.548 [74].\n6.\tThe (R)AN may acknowledge N2 PDU Session Request by sending a N2 PDU Session Ack (N2 SM information (List of accepted/rejected QFI(s), AN Tunnel Info, PDU Session ID, Secondary RAT usage data, TL-Container(s), BAT offset, Periodicity, established QoS Flows status (active/not active) (for one of the following: congestion information monitoring, ECN marking for L4S at PSA UPF, ECN marking for L4S at NG-RAN), PDU Set Based Handling Support Indication), User location Information) Message to the AMF. In the case of Dual Connectivity, if one or more QFIs were added to the PDU Session, the Master RAN node may assign one or more of these QFIs to a NG-RAN node which was not involved in the PDU Session earlier. In this case the AN Tunnel Info includes a new N3 tunnel endpoint for QFIs assigned to the new NG-RAN node. Correspondingly, if one or more QFIs were removed from the PDU Session, a (R)AN node may no longer be involved in the PDU Session anymore and the corresponding tunnel endpoint is removed from the AN Tunnel Info. The NG-RAN may reject QFI(s) if it cannot fulfil the User Plane Security Enforcement information for a corresponding QoS Profile, e.g. due to the UE Integrity Protection Maximum Data Rate being exceeded. When receiving the request for QoS Monitoring, the (R)AN may indicate its rejection to perform QoS Monitoring, e.g. due to the (R)AN load condition. The (R)AN may reject the addition or modification of a QoS Flow, e.g. due to handling of the UE-Slice-MBR as described in clause 5.7.1.10 of TS 23.501 [2]. If the (R)AN rejects the addition or modification of a QoS Flow, the SMF is responsible of updating the QoS rules and QoS Flow level QoS parameters associated to that QoS Flow in the UE accordingly. NG-RAN includes the PDU Set Based Handling Support Indication in N2 SM information as defined in clause 5.37.5.3 of TS 23.501 [2]\nIf the PLMN has configured secondary RAT usage reporting, the NG-RAN node may provide RAN Usage Data Report. The User Location Information shall include the serving cell's ID and if Dual Connectivity is activated for the UE, the PSCell ID.\nIf the redundant transmission has not been activated to the PDU session and the SMF indicates to the RAN that one of the QoS Flow shall perform redundant transmission, the RAN includes an additional AN tunnel info in N2 SM information.\nIf interworking with TSN deployed in the transport network is supported and the NG-RAN supports AN-TL and received a TL-Container with a set-request from the SM/CUC in step 3b (see clause 4.4.8 of TS 23.501 [2]), the NG-RAN/AN-TL includes a TL-Container with a set-response to the N2 SM information, as described in clause 5.28a.2 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf the NG-RAN has determined a BAT offset and optionally a periodicity as described in clause 5.27.2.5 of TS 23.501 [2], the NG-RAN provides the BAT offset and optionally the periodicity in the N2 SM information.\n7.\tThe AMF forwards the N2 SM information and the User location Information received from the AN to the SMF via Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext service operation. The SMF replies with a Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response.\nIf the N2 SM information indicates failure of whole N2 SM request (i.e. no part of the N2 SM request is successful in (R)AN), the SMF assumes that the NAS PDU, if provided in step 3, was not forwarded by NG-RAN to UE, as described in TS 38.413 [10]. In this case, if the PDU Session modification is UE triggered the SMF shall reject the PDU session modification by including a N1 SM container with a PDU Session Modification Reject message (see clause 8.3.3 of TS 24.501 [25]) in the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response in step 7b. Step 8 is skipped in this case.\nOtherwise, the SMF assumes that the NAS PDU was sent to UE successfully. If the (R)AN rejects QFI(s), the SMF is responsible of updating the QoS rules and QoS Flow level QoS parameters if needed for the QoS Flow(s) associated with the QoS rule(s) in the UE accordingly, i.e. the SMF shall trigger a separate NAS PDU Session Modification procedure after step 11 to align the SM context of this PDU Session in UE.\n8.\tThe SMF may update N4 session of the UPF(s) that are involved by the PDU Session Modification by sending N4 Session Modification Request message to the UPF (see NOTE 3).\nThe SMF may update the UPF with N4 Rules related to new, modified or removed QoS Flow(s), unless it was done already in step 2a.\nNOTE 4:\tThis allows the DL packets of the new or modified QoS Flow to be transferred.\nIf an additional AN Tunnel Info is returned by RAN in step 6, the SMF informs the UPF about this AN Tunnel Info for redundant transmission. In the case of redundant transmission with two I-UPFs, the SMF provides AN Tunnel Info to two I-UPFs. If CN Tunnel Info of two I-UPFs is allocated by the UPFs in step 2b, the SMF also provides the DL CN Tunnel Info of two I-UPFs to the UPF (PSA).\nIf the QoS Monitoring is enabled for the QoS Flow, the SMF provides the N4 rules containing the QoS Monitoring policy generated according to the information received in step 1b to the UPF via the N4 Session Modification Request message as defined in clause 5.45 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf port number and a Port Management Information Container have been received from PCF in Step 2 and the port number matches the port number of the NW-TT port for this PDU session, then SMF includes the Port Management Information Container in the N4 Session Modification Request. If the N4 Session Modification Request includes a Port Management Information Container, then UPF also includes a Port Management Information Container in the N4 Session Modification Response.\nIf SMF decides to enable ECN marking for L4S by PSA UPF, a QoS Flow level ECN marking for L4S indicator shall be sent by SMF to PSA UPF over N4 as described in clause 5.37.3.3 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf the N2 SM information includes the PDU Set Based Handling Support Indication and there are PCC Rules with PDU Set QoS parameters for DL, SMF configures PSA UPF to activate PDU set identification and marking for the QoS flow as described in clause 5.37.5.3 of TS 23.501 [2].\n9.\tThe UE acknowledges the PDU Session Modification Command by sending a NAS message (PDU Session ID, N1 SM container (PDU Session Modification Command Ack, [Port Management Information Container])) message.\n10.\tThe (R)AN forwards the NAS message to the AMF.\n11.\tThe AMF forwards the N1 SM container (PDU Session Modification Command Ack) and User Location Information received from the AN to the SMF via Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext service operation. The SMF replies with a Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response.\nIf the SMF initiated modification is to delete QoS Flows (e.g. triggered by PCF) which do not include QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule and the SMF does not receive response from the UE, the SMF marks that the status of those QoS Flows is to be synchronized with the UE.\nIf interworking with TSN deployed in the transport network is supported, for any QoS Flow including a TSC Assistance Container, the SMF/CUC derives the merged stream requirements as described in Annex M of TS 23.501 [2]. If AN-TL and CN-TL are supported, the SMF/CUC uses the information provided in the get-responses stored during the PDU Session Establishment procedure to derive the merged stream requirements. The SMF/CUC interacts with the CNC deployed in the transport network and provides the merged stream requirements in the Talker and Listener groups to the TN CNC. The TN CNC uses the merged stream requirements as input to select respective path(s) and calculate schedules in TN.\nBased on the processing results, the TN CNC provides a Status group that contains the merged end station communication-configuration back to the SMF/CUC.\n12.\tThe SMF may update N4 session of the UPF(s) that are involved by the PDU Session Modification by sending N4 Session Modification Request (N4 Session ID) message to the UPF. For a PDU Session of Ethernet PDU Session Type, the SMF may notify the UPF to add or remove Ethernet Packet Filter Set(s) and forwarding rule(s).\nNOTE 5:\tThe UPFs that are impacted in the PDU Session Modification procedure depends on the modified QoS parameters and on the deployment. For example in the case of the session AMBR of a PDU Session with an UL CL changes, only the UL CL is involved. This note also applies to the step 8.\n13.\tIf the SMF interacted with the PCF in step 1b or 2, the SMF notifies the PCF whether the PCC decision could be enforced or not by performing an SMF initiated SM Policy Association Modification procedure as defined in clause 4.16.5.1. If the trigger for 5GS Bridge/Router information available is armed and the SMF received a Port Management Information Container from either UE or UPF, then SMF provides the Port Management Information Container and the port number of the related port to the PCF in this step, as described in clause 5.28.3.2 of TS 23.501 [2]. If the trigger for 5GS Bridge/Router information available is armed and the SMF received the User Plane node Management Information Container from UPF, then the SMF provides the User Plane node Management Information Container to the PCF as described in clause 5.28.3.2 of TS 23.501 [2]. If trigger for Notification on BAT offset is armed and the SMF received BAT offset and/or Periodicity from the RAN, then the SMF provides the BAT offset and/or Periodicity to the PCF as described in clause 5.27.2.5 of TS 23.501 [2].\nSMF notifies any entity that has subscribed to User Location Information related with PDU Session change.\nIf step 1b is triggered to perform Application Function influence on traffic routing by step 5 in clause 4.3.6.2, the SMF may reconfigure the User Plane of the PDU Session as described in step 6 in clause 4.3.6.2.\nIf interworking with TSN deployed in the transport network is supported and if the Status group from TN CNC to SMF/CUC in step 11 includes InterfaceConfiguration and if the AN-TL/CN-TL are supported, the SMF/CUC initiates a PDU Session Modification procedure as in step 1d.",

The H-SMF responds to the request immediately. If the AMF notified the V-SMF that the access type of the PDU session can be changed, as described in the UE Triggered Service Request procedure in clause 4.2.3.2, the V-SMF shall also indicate that the access type can be changed.\nThe PS Data Off status, if changed, shall be included in PCO (Protocol Configuration Option) in the PDU Session Modification Request message.\nWhen PCF is deployed, the SMF shall further report the PS Data Off status to PCF if the PS Data Off event trigger is provisioned, the additional behaviour of SMF and PCF for 3GPP PS Data Off is defined in TS 23.503 [20].\n1b.\t(HPLMN requested) This step is the same as step 1b in clause 4.3.3.2.

The V-SMF shall also be able to accept a subset of the QoS flows requested to be created or modified within a single H-SMF request i.e. V-SMF can accept some QoS flows and reject other QoS flows in same response to H-SMF.\nIf an Always-on PDU Session Granted indication was provided by the H-SMF to indicate that the PDU Session is to be changed to an always-on PDU Session, the V-SMF decides whether to accept or reject the request from the H-SMF based on local policies.\nFor network slice replacement, based on the information received from the V-SMF, the H-SMF determines whether to retain the PDU Session as described in clause 5.15.19 of TS 23.501 [2]. If the H-SMF decides to retain the PDU Session, the H-SMF includes the Alternative HPLMN S-NSSAI and a cause value indicating that the PDU Session is to be retained in the Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request message. For SSC mode 3 PDU Session if the H-SMF decides to establish a new PDU Session on the Alternative HPLMN S-NSSAI, the H-SMF includes Alternative HPLMN S-NSSAI and a cause value indicating that a new PDU Session re-establishment on the Alternative HPLMN S-NSSAI is required in the Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request message. For SSC mode 1 and SSC mode 2 PDU session if the H-SMF decides to establish a new PDU Session on the HPLMN Alternative S-NSSAI, the H-SMF initiates release of the PDU Session as described in clause 4.3.4.3.\n3a-3b (HPLMN requested) These steps are executed if new QoS Flow(s) are to be created. The SMF updates the UPF with UL Packet Detection Rules of the new QoS Flow. These steps are executed if the HPLMN S-NSSAI is replaced by an Alternative HPLMN S-NSSAI and the PDU Session is retained. The SMF updates the UPF with Alternative S-NSSAI.\nNOTE 2:\tThis allows the UL packets with the QFI of the new QoS Flow to be transferred.\n4a-4b.\tThese steps are the same as step 3a-3b in clause 4.3.3.2 but controlled from the V-SMF. The V-SMF uses the information received in step 3 to generate any N1 and/or N2 signalling to be sent towards the UE and/or the (R)AN.\nFor network slice replacement in step 1f, the following applies:\n-\tIf the PDU Session is to be retained and only the VPLMN S-NSSAI is to be replaced by an Alternative VPLMN S-NSSAI, the V-SMF includes Alternative VPLMN S-NSSAI in the N1 PDU Session Modification Command message and a cause value to notify the UE that the VPLMN S-NSSAI of the PDU Session is replaced with the Alternative VPLMN S-NSSAI. The V-SMF also set the S-NSSAI in N2 SM information to Alternative VPLMN S-NSSAI.\n-\tIf the PDU Session is to be retained and only the HPLMN S-NSSAI is to be replaced by an Alternative HPLMN S-NSSAI, the V-SMF includes Alternative HPLMN S-NSSAI in the N1 PDU Session Modification Command message and a cause value to notify the UE that the HPLMN S-NSSAI is replaced with the Alternative HPLMN S-NSSAI\n-\tIf the PDU Session is to be retained and both VPLMN S-NSSAI and HPLMN S-NSSAI are to be replaced, the V-SMF includes Alternative HPLMN S-NSSAI and VPLMN Alternative S-NSSAI in the N1 PDU Session Modification Command message and a cause value to notify the UE that the HPLMN S-NSSAI is replaced with the Alternative HPLMN S-NSSAI and the VPLMN S-NSSAI of the PDU Session is replaced with Alternative VPLMN S-NSSAI. The V-SMF sets the S-NSSAI in N2 SM information to Alternative VPLMN S-NSSAI.\n-\tIf a new PDU Session establishment is required, the V-SMF includes Alternative HPLMN S-NSSAI and/or Alternative VPLMN S-NSSAI in the N1 PDU Session Modification Command message and a cause value to notify the UE that a new PDU Session establishment on the HPLMN Alternative S-NSSAI and/or Alternative VPLMN S-NSSAI is required.\n5-7.\tThese steps are the same as step 4-6 in clause 4.3.3.2.\n8.\tThis step is the same as step 7a in clause 4.3.3.2 with the difference that the SMF is V-SMF.\nIf the N2 SM information indicates modification failure and the V-SMF rejected the PDU session modification as described in step 7 in clause 4.3.3.2, step 9 is skipped.\n9a-9b are the same as step 8a-8b in clause 4.3.3.2 but executed in Visited PLMN\n10.\tThis step is the same as step 7b in clause 4.3.3.2 with the difference that the SMF is V-SMF.\n11-12.\tThese steps are the same as steps 8-9 in 4.3.3.2.\n13-14.\tThese steps are the same as step 11a-11b in clause 4.3.3.2 but executed in Visited PLMN.\n15.\tV-SMF responds to the H-SMF with an Nsmf_PDUSession_Update response carrying the information like PCO provided by the UE in the SM PDU Session Modification Command Ack message from the UE to the V-SMF, Secondary RAT usage data.

      "content": "Figure 4.3.4.2-1 captures both the UE Requested PDU Session Release procedure and the network requested PDU Session Release procedure. The procedure allows the UE to request the release of one PDU Session. The procedure also allows the AMF, the SMF or the PCF to initiate the release of a PDU Session. In the case of LBO, the procedure is as in the case of non-roaming with the difference that the AMF, the SMF, the UPF and the PCF are located in the visited network.\nFigure 4.3.4.2-1: UE or network requested PDU Session Release for non-roaming and roaming with local breakout\n1.\tThe procedure is triggered by one of the following events:\n1a.\t(UE requested) The UE initiates the UE Requested PDU Session Release procedure by the transmission of an NAS message (N1 SM container (PDU Session Release Request (PDU session ID)), PDU Session ID). The NAS message is forwarded by the (R)AN to the AMF with an indication of User Location Information. This message is relayed to the SMF corresponding to the PDU Session ID via N2 and the AMF. The AMF invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext service operation and provides the N1 SM container to the SMF together with User Location Information (ULI) received from the (R)AN.\nNOTE 1:\tDepending on the Access Type, when the UE is in CM-IDLE state, the UE can trigger a Service Request procedure before being able to release the PDU Session.\n1b.\t(PDU Session Release initiated by the PCF) The PCF may invoke an SM Policy Association Termination procedure as defined in clause 4.16.6 to request the release of the PDU Session.\n1c.\tThe AMF may invoke the Nsmf_PDUSession_ReleaseSMContext service operation to request the release of the PDU Session in the case of mismatch of PDU Session status between UE and AMF or other cases where neither N1 nor N2 SM signalling is needed before the releasing of SM context.\nNOTE 2:\tThe AMF invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_ReleaseSMContext service operation when the AMF determines to release the PDU Session due to S-NSSAI is removed from Allowed NSSAI and the AMF separately updates the UE with a PDU Session status without the PDU Session, in a Registration Accept as specified in clause 4.2.2.2.2.\n1d.\t(R)AN may decide to indicate to the SMF that the PDU Session related resource is released, e.g. when all the QoS Flow(s) of the PDU Session are released.\nNOTE 3:\tIn this case, it's up to SMF to decide whether to keep the PDU Session with user plane connection deactivated or release the PDU Session.\n1e.\t(PDU Session Release initiated by the SMF).\nThe SMF may decide to release a PDU Session under the following scenarios:\n-\tBased on a request from the DN (cancelling the UE authorization to access to the DN);\n-\tBased on a request from the UDM (subscription change) or from the CHF;\n-\tIf the SMF received an event notification from the AMF that the UE is out of LADN service area;\n-\tBased on locally configured policy (e.g. the release procedure may be related with the UPF re-allocation for SSC mode 2 / mode 3);\n-\tIf the SMF is notified by the (R)AN that the PDU Session resource establishment has failed during mobility procedure;\n-\tThe SMF initiates release of an emergency PDU Session when the UPF reports detection of PDU Session inactivity for a specified period as specified in clause 4.4.2.2;\n-\tBased on PDU Session inactivity report from the UPF if the S-NSSAI of a PDU Session for non-roaming subscribers is subject to usage control as described in clause 5.15.15 of TS 23.501 [2]; or\n-\tIf the SMF is notified by the AMF that the S-NSSAI of the PDU Session with SSC mode 1 or SSC mode 2 is to be replaced with Alternative S-NSSAI, and if the SMF determines that a new PDU Session is to be established on the Alternative S-NSSAI, the SMF initiates release of the PDU Session, as described in clause 5.15.19 of TS 23.501 [2].\n1f.\tThe AMF may invoke the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext service operation with a release indication to request the release of the PDU Session where:\n-\tN1 signalling is needed and N2 SM signalling may be needed before releasing the SM context with appropriate cause value (e.g. due to a change of the set of network slices for a UE where a network slice instance is no longer available as described in clause 5.15.5.2.2 of TS 23.501 [2];\n-\tThe AAA Server triggered Network Slice-Specific Re-authentication and Re-authorization procedure fails as specified in clause 4.2.9.2;\n-\tThe AAA Server triggered Slice-Specific Authorization Revocation takes place as specified in clause 4.2.9.4;\n-\tAMF determines that Control Plane Only indication associated with PDU Session is not applicable any longer as described in clause 5.31.4.1 of TS 23.501 [2]);\n-\tThe MBSR authorization state is changed from \"authorized\" to \"not authorized\" as described in clause 5.35A.4 of TS 23.501 [2];\n-\tThe Network Slice instance is congested or not available as described in clause 5.15.5.3 of TS 23.501 [2].\n-\tThere is no LADN service area for the DNN and S-NSSAI of the PDU session and the AMF determines to configure the LADN service area configured per LADN DNN and S-NSSAI for the associated DNN and S-NSSAI (e.g. due to notification from UDM or local configuration update);\n-\tThe PDU session is subject to LADN per LADN DNN and S-NSSAI and the AMF determines the LADN service area for the DNN and S-NSSAI is removed (e.g. due to notification from UDM or local configuration update).\nIf the SMF receives one of the triggers in step 1a, 1b, 1c, 1e, or 1f, the SMF starts PDU Session Release procedure. If the cause value in step 1f indicates the Network Slice instance is congested or not available, the SMF triggers the impacted UE(s) to establish new PDU session(s) associated with the same S-NSSAI by using the procedures for PDU Session(s) of SSC mode 2 or SSC mode 3 as defined in clause 4.3.5.\nIf interworking with TSN deployed in the transport network is supported the SMF/CUC shall initiate the release of TN streams via UNI.\n2.\tThe SMF releases the IP address / Prefix(es) that were allocated to the PDU Session and releases the corresponding User Plane resources:\n2a.\tThe SMF sends an N4 Session Release Request (N4 Session ID) message to the UPF(s) of the PDU Session. The UPF(s) shall drop any remaining packets of the PDU Session and release all tunnel resource and contexts associated with the N4 Session.\nIf interworking with TSN deployed in the transport network is supported and the UPF supports CN-TL and TN streams are associated with the PDU session, the SMF/CUC shall initiate to the CN-TL the deletion of TN stream configurations.\n2b.\tThe UPF(s) acknowledges the N4 Session Release Request by the transmission of an N4 Session Release Response (N4 Session ID, [Small Data Rate Control Status], [APN Rate Control Status]) message to the SMF.\nIf UPF/CN-TL has performed the deletion of TN stream based on the request received from the SMF/CUC in step 2a, the UPF/CN-TL shall confirm the deletion of TN stream configurations.\nThe UPF includes Small Data Rate Control Status if the PDU Session used Small Data Rate Control.\nIf a NEF has been selected as anchor of the Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation enabled PDU session which is Unstructured PDU Session Type as described in clause 4.3.2.2 and the SMF-NEF Connection is released for this PDU Session.\nIf interworking with TSN deployed in the transport network is supported and the NG-RAN supports AN-TL and TN streams are associated with the released PDU session, the SMF/CUC shall initiate to the AN-TL the deletion of TN stream configurations.\nNOTE 4:\tIf there are multiple UPFs associated with the PDU Session (e.g. due to the insertion of UL CL or Branching Point, or redundant I-UPFs if the redundant I-UPFs are used for URLLC), the Session Release Request procedure (steps 2a and 2b) is done for each UPF. In order to avoid charging of PDUs that later get dropped, the SMF performs the N4 Session Release first with the UPF(s) performing usage reporting, before releasing the other UPF(s) that forward traffic for the same user plane resources.\n3\tIf the PDU Session Release is initiated by the PCF and SMF and the SMF has been notified by the AMF that UE is unreachable, e.g. due to the UE is in MICO mode or periodical registration failure, the procedure continues in step 11 by SMF notifying the AMF that the PDU Session is released by invoking the Nsmf_PDUSession_SMContextStatusNotify. The rest of step 3 and the steps 4-10 are skipped.\nIf the PDU Session Release procedure was triggered by steps 1a, 1b, 1d or 1e above, the SMF creates an N1 SM including PDU Session Release Command message (PDU Session ID, Cause, Alternative S-NSSAI). The Cause may indicate a trigger to establish a new PDU Session with the same characteristics (e.g. when procedures related with SSC mode 2 are invoked). .If the cause value indicates that a PDU Session re-establishment on the Alternative S-NSSAI is required the PDU Session Release Command message also includes the Alternative S-NSSAI. The UE establishes a new PDU Session on the Alternative S-NSSAI, as described in clause 5.15.19 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf the User Plane connection of the PDU Session is activated, the message sent by the SMF to the AMF shall include N2 SM Resource Release request. If the User Plane connection of the PDU Session is not activated, the message sent by the SMF to the AMF shall not include N2 SM Resource Release request.\nNOTE 5:\tSSC modes are defined in clause 5.6.9 of TS 23.501 [2].\n3a.\t(If the PDU Session Release is initiated by the UE in step 1a or has been triggered by (R)AN in step 1d) The SMF responds to the AMF with the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext response (N2 SM Resource Release request, N1 SM container (PDU Session Release Command)). N2 SM Resource Release request is included if the PDU Session Release is initiated by the UE and if the UP connection of the PDU Session is active. Neither N2 SM Resource Release request nor N1 SM container is included if the PDU Session Release is triggered by (R)AN and the SMF decides to keep the PDU session with user plane connection deactivated and the subsequent steps are skipped.\n3b.\tIf the PDU Session Release is initiated by the SMF or the PCF, the SMF invokes the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation (N1 SM container (PDU Session Release Command), skip indicator).\nIf the UP connection of the PDU Session is active, the SMF shall also include the N2 Resource Release request (PDU Session ID) in the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer, to release the (R)AN resources associated with the PDU Session.\nThe \"skip indicator\" tells the AMF whether it may skip sending the N1 SM container to the UE (e.g. when the UE is in CM-IDLE state). SMF includes the \"skip indicator\" in the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer except when the procedure is triggered to change PDU Session Anchor of a PDU Session with SSC mode 2.\nIf the UE is in CM-IDLE state and \"skip indicator\" is included in the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation or if the UE is in CM-IDLE state and \"skip indicator\" is not included in the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation but the AMF detects that the UE context contains Paging Restriction Information indicating that all paging is restricted, the AMF acknowledges the step 3b by sending an Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer Response message (\"N1 SM Message Not Transferred\") to SMF and steps 4 to 10 are skipped.\n3c.\tIf the PDU Session Release is initiated by the AMF in step 1c, i.e. the SMF received the Nsmf_PDUSession_ReleaseSMContext Request from the AMF, the SMF responds to the AMF with the Nsmf_PDUSession_ReleaseSMContext response, optionally including the Small Data Rate Control Status and APN Rate Control Status.\nIf the UPF included APN Rate Control Status and/or Small Data Rate Control Status in step 2 then the SMF includes APN Rate Control and/or Small Data Rate Control Status and the AMF stores the Small Data Rate Control Status and/or the APN Rate Control Status in the UE context in AMF.\nThe AMF and SMF shall remove all contexts (including the PDU Session ID) associated with the PDU Session which are indicated as released at the UE. The SMF shall remove any event subscriptions on the AMF by the SMF that becomes no more needed due to the PDU Session Release. The steps 4 to 11 are skipped.\n3d.\tIf the PDU Session Release is initiated by the AMF in step 1f, i.e. the SMF received the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request from the AMF with a release indication to request the release of the PDU Session, the SMF responds to the AMF with the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response which may contain the N1 SM container (PDU Session Release Command) to release the PDU session at the UE.\nIf the UP connection of the PDU Session is active, the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response shall also include the N2 Resource Release request (PDU Session ID) to release the (R)AN resources associated with the PDU Session.\n4.\tIf the UE is in CM-IDLE state and \"N1 SM delivery can be skipped\" is not indicated, the AMF initiates the network triggered Service Request procedure to transmit the NAS message (PDU Session ID, N1 SM container) to the UE and the steps 6, 7 are skipped.\nIf the message received from the SMF in step 3 does not include N2 SM Resource Release request, the AMF transmits the NAS message (PDU Session ID, N1 SM container) to the UE and the steps 6, 7 are skipped.\nIf the PDU Session is Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation enabled, the SMF shall not include N2 SM Resource Release request in the message sent to the AMF, the AMF transmits the NAS message (PDU Session ID, N1 SM container) to the UE and the steps 6, 7 are skipped.\nIf the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state and the received message from the SMF in step 3 includes N2 SM Resource Release request, the AMF transfers the SM information received from the SMF in step 4 (N2 SM Resource Release request, N1 SM container) to the (R)AN.\nIf the message from the SMF includes Small Data Rate Control Status then the AMF stores it in the UE Context in AMF.\n5.\tWhen the (R)AN has received an N2 SM request to release the AN resources associated with the PDU Session it issues AN specific signalling exchange(s) with the UE to release the corresponding AN resources.\nIn the case of a NG-RAN, the NAS message is sent to the UE in an RRC message which may take place with the UE releasing the NG-RAN resources related to the PDU Session. If NG-RAN resources do not need to be released (i.e. the User Plane of the PDU Session is deactivated), the NAS message is sent to the UE in an RRC message which does not release the NG-RAN resources related to the PDU Session.\nDuring this procedure, the (R)AN sends any NAS message (N1 SM container (PDU Session Release Command)) received from the AMF in step 4.\nFor PDU Session for non-roaming subscribers, if the S-NSSAI of the released PDU Session is subject to network slice usage control as described in clause 5.15.15 of TS 23.501 [2] and there is no other PDU Session using the S-NSSAI over which the Access Type the PDU Session was released, the UE starts slice deregistration inactivity timer for the S-NSSAI over the Access Type if the UE received slice deregistration inactivity timer for the S-NSSAI for that the Access Type.\n6.\t[Conditional] If the (R)AN had received a N2 SM request to release the AN resources, the (R)AN acknowledges the N2 SM Resource Release Request by sending an N2 SM Resource Release Ack (User Location Information, Secondary RAT usage data) Message to the AMF.\nIf the PLMN has configured secondary RAT usage reporting, the NG-RAN node may provide RAN Usage Data Report.\nIf NG-RAN/AN-TL has performed the deletion of TN stream based on the request received from the SMF/CUC in step 3, the NG-RAN/AN-TL shall confirm the deletion of TN stream configurations.\n7a.\tThe AMF invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext (N2 SM Resource Release Ack (Secondary RAT usage data), User Location Information) to the SMF.\n7b.\tThe SMF responds to the AMF with an Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext response.\n8.\tThe UE acknowledges the PDU Session Release Command by sending a NAS message (PDU Session ID, N1 SM container (PDU Session Release Ack)) over the (R)AN.\n9.\t[Conditional] The (R)AN forwards the NAS message from the UE by sending a N2 NAS uplink transport (NAS message (PDU Session ID, N1 SM container (PDU Session Release Ack)), User Location Information) to the AMF.\n10a.\tThe AMF invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext (N1 SM container (PDU Session Release Ack, User Location Information) to the SMF.\n10b.\tThe SMF responds to the AMF with an Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext response.\nSteps 8-10 may happen before steps 6-7.\n11.\tIf steps 3a, 3b or 3d were performed, the SMF waits until it has received replies to the N1 and N2 information provided in step 3, as needed.\nThe SMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_SMContextStatusNotify to notify AMF that the SM context for this PDU Session is released. If the UPF included Small Data Rate Control Status and/or APN Rate Control Status in step 2 then the SMF includes Small Data Rate Control Status and/or APN Rate Control Status in its request to the AMF in this step. The AMF releases the association between the SMF ID and the PDU Session ID, DNN, as well as S-NSSAI and stores the Small Data Rate Control Status and/or the APN Rate Control Status in the UE context in AMF. The SMF shall remove any event subscriptions on the AMF that becomes no more needed due to the PDU Session Release.\nNOTE 6:\tThe UE and the 5GC will get synchronized about the status of the (released) PDU Session at the next Service Request or Registration procedure.\nFor PDU Session for non-roaming subscribers, if the S-NSSAI of the released PDU Session is subject to network slice usage control and if the SMF indicates cause of slice inactivity and there is no other PDU Session using the S-NSSAI over which the Access Type the PDU Session was released, then AMF may remove the S-NSSAI from the Allowed NSSAI or start slice deregistration inactivity timer for the S-NSSAI for that Access Type as described in clause 5.15.15.3 of TS 23.501 [2]. If the AMF did not provide slice deregistration inactivity timer of the S-NSSAI to the UE for the Access Type and S-NSSAI is removed from Allowed NSSAI, the AMF triggers UE Configuration Update procedure to provide the new Allowed NSSAI to the UE.\n12.\tIf Dynamic PCC applied to this session the SMF invokes an SM Policy Association Termination procedure as defined in clause 4.16.6 to delete the PDU Session.\n13.\tSMF notifies any entity that has subscribed to User Location Information related with PDU Session change.\n14.\tIf it is the last PDU Session the SMF is handling for the UE for the associated (DNN, S-NSSAI), the SMF unsubscribes from Session Management Subscription data changes notification with the UDM by means of the Nudm_SDM_Unsubscribe (SUPI, DNN, S-NSSAI) service operation. The UDM may unsubscribe the subscription notification from UDR by Nudr_DM_Unsubscribe (SUPI, Subscription Data, Session Management Subscription data, DNN, S-NSSAI).\n15.\tThe SMF invokes the Nudm_UECM_Deregistration service operation including the DNN and the PDU Session ID.

The H-SMF responds to the request immediately.\n1b.\t(Serving network initiated release) The serving network initiates the PDU Session Release during UE or serving network initiated Deregistration procedure as specified in clause 4.2.2.3. There is no NAS SM message between the UE and the V-SMF in this case. This step is the same as step 1c in clause 4.3.4.2, with the addition that:\n-\tthe V-SMF initiates N4 Session Modification to instruct the V-UPF to stop forwarding uplink traffic; and\n-\tthe V-SMF initiates the release of the PDU Session at the H-SMF by invoking the Nsmf_PDUSession_Release request.\nThe serving network also initiates the PDU Session Release where neither N1 nor N2 SM signalling is needed before releasing the SM context as in step 1c in clause 4.3.4.2 if e.g. due to the set of network slices for a UE changes where a network slice instance is no longer available (e.g. as described in clause 5.15.5.2.2 of TS 23.501 [2], or the AAA Server triggered Network Slice-Specific Re-authentication and Re-authorization procedure fails as specified in clause 4.2.9.2 or the AAA Server triggered Slice-Specific Authorization Revocation takes place as specified in clause 4.2.9.4).\n1c.\t(HPLMN initiated release) This step is the same as step 1b in clause 4.3.4.2, with the addition that:\n-\tthe H-SMF initiates N4 Session Modification to instruct the H-UPF to stop forwarding downlink traffic.\n1d.\tThis step is the same as step 1d in clause 4.3.4.2, with the addition that:\n-\tthe V-SMF initiates N4 Session Modification to instruct the V-UPF to stop forwarding uplink traffic; and\n-\tthe V-SMF invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request towards H-SMF.\n1e.\t(HPLMN initiated release) This step is the same as step 1e in clause 4.3.4.2, with the addition that:\n-\tif the H-SMF is notified by the V-SMF that the HPLMN S-NSSAI of the PDU Session with SSC mode 1 or SSC mode 2 is to be replaced with Alternative HPLMN S-NSSAI and if the H-SMF determines that a new PDU Session is to be established on the Alternative HPLMN S-NSSAI, the H-SMF initiates release of the PDU Session, as described in clause 5.15.19 of TS 23.501 [2];\n-\tthe H-SMF initiates N4 Session Modification to instruct the H-UPF to stop forwarding downlink traffic.\n1f.\tThis step is the same as step 1f in clause 4.3.4.2, with the addition that:\n-\tthe V-SMF initiates N4 Session Modification to instruct the V-UPF to stop forwarding uplink traffic; and\n-\tthe V-SMF invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request towards H-SMF.\nIf the SMF receives one of the triggers in step 1a, 1c, 1e or 1f, the H-SMF starts PDU Session Release procedure.\nWhen a SMF above initiates N4 Session Modification to instruct the UPF to stop forwarding traffic this means also to stop taking into account the traffic for usage monitoring.\n2a-2b.\t(UE-, (R)AN- or Serving network initiated) This step is performed in case the PDU Session Release is triggered by a message from V-SMF.

The Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request contains necessary information to build the SM Release PDU Session Command by the V-SMF towards the UE (for example a Release Cause or PCO).\nFor network slice replacement as in step 1e, the H-SMF includes Alternative HPLMN S-NSSAI and a cause value indicating that a new PDU Session re-establishment on the Alternative HPLMN S-NSSAI is required.\n3b.\t(Serving network initiated release) The H-SMF responds to the PDU release request from the V-SMF with a Nsmf_PDUSession_Release response.\nIf the UPF included Small Data Rate Control Status in step 2 then the SMF includes Small Data Rate Control Status in the request to the AMF.\nIf the Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation is enabled for this PDU Session, the steps 4a and 4b are skipped.\n4a-4b.\tThe V-SMF releases the corresponding User Plane resources. This includes the same procedure in step 2 but controlled from the SMF in VPLMN.\n5-13.\tThese steps are the same as steps 3-10 in clause 4.3.4.2, with the addition that:\n-\tIn step 5c, for network slice replacement, based on information from H-SMF, the PDU Session Release Command message may include Alternative HPLMN S-NSSAI and/or Alternative VPLMN S-NSSAI and a cause value indicating that a PDU Session re-establishment on the Alternative HPLMN S-NSSAI and/or Alternative VPLMN S-NSSAI is required.\n14.\t(UE or HPLMN initiated release) The V-SMF responds to the Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request invoked at step 3a and confirms the PDU Session Release. The Nsmf_PDUSession_Update response may carry information such as PCO received from the UE in SM PDU Session Release Accept. as well as User Location Information, Time Zone and Secondary RAT Usage Data.\n15a.\t(UE or HPLMN or Serving network initiated release) The H-SMF releases the SM policy control association with the PCF by invoking the SM Policy Association Termination procedure defined in clause 4.16.6. For serving network initiated PDU Session Release case, this step happens between step 1b and step 3b.\n15b-15c.\t(HPLMN initiated release) In case the PDU Session Release is HPLMN-initiated (i.e. triggers in 1c, 1e), the H-SMF releases the corresponding User Plane resources. This includes the same procedure as in step 2.\n15d.\tAs in step 15 of clause 4.3.4.2, the SMF invokes the Nudm_UECM_Deregistration service operation.\nNOTE 2:\tStep 15d does not necessarily take place after step 15c.\n16.\t(UE or HPLMN initiated release) The H-SMF shall remove all contexts associated with the PDU Session:\n16a.\tThe H-SMF requests the V-SMF to release all contexts associated with the PDU Session by invoking the Nsmf_PDUSession_StatusNotify (Release) operation.\n16b.\tThe V-SMF requests the AMF to release all contexts associated with the PDU Session by invoking the Nsmf_PDUSession_SMContexStatusNotify (Release).

This procedure releases the existing PDU Session associated with an old PDU Session Anchor (i.e. UPF1 in figure 4.3.5.2-1) after having established a new PDU Session to the same DN with a new PDU Session Anchor (i.e. UPF2 in figure 4.3.5.2-1), which is controlled by the same SMF.

If the \"Indication of application relocation possibility\" attributes in the PCC rule indicates no DNAI change takes place once selected for this application, the SMF determines that the SMF can not be changed.\n1a. If the UPF (PSA) cannot connect to the target DNAI(s) that SMF received from SM-PCF, the SMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_SMContextStatusNotify Request (target DNAI information) service operation to the AMF. The SMF also indicate the SMF selection is expected.\nIf the runtime coordination between 5GC and AF (Figure 4.3.6.3-1) is enabled, the SMF includes in the Nsmf_PDUSession_SMContextStatusNotify Request the SM Context ID as a reference to the SM Context that includes AF Coordination Information stored in the SMF.\nThe target DNAI information are used for SMF selection which can control UPF connecting to that DNAI at next PDU session establishment towards the same DNN and S-NSSAI. Due to it is for SMF selection, the AMF stores the target DNAI information received from SMF selection. The target DNAI information is not transferred outside, e.g. to support the UE context transfer between AMFs for AMF relocation.\n2.\tIf the SMF had sent an early notification to the AF and the runtime coordination between 5GC and AF is enabled based on local configuration as specified in clause 4.3.6.3, according to the indication of \"AF acknowledgment to be expected\" included in AF subscription to SMF events, the SMF waits for a notification response from the AF. If the SMF receives a negative notification response from the AF, the SMF may stop the procedure. This is defined in Figure 4.3.6.3-1.\nThe SMF invokes the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer (PDU Session ID, SMF Reallocation requested indication, N1 SM container (PDU Session Modification Command (Cause, PCO (PDU Session Address Lifetime value)))) where PDU Session ID indicates the existing PDU Session to be relocated and Cause indicates that a PDU Session re-establishment to the same DN is required.\nThe SMF Reallocation requested indication indicates whether the SMF is requested to be reallocated.\nThe PDU Session Address Lifetime value is delivered to the UE upper layers in PCO and indicates how long the network is willing to maintain the PDU Session. The SMF starts a PDU Session Release timer corresponding to the PDU Session Address Lifetime value.\n3a.\tThe AMF forwards the NAS message to the UE. The UE can provide the release timer value to the upper layers if received in the PDU Session Modification Command.\n3b.\tThe UE acknowledges the PDU Session Modification Command.\n3c.\tThe AMF forwards the N1 SM container (PDU Session Modification Command ACK) received from the (R)AN to the SMF1 via Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext service operation.\n3d.\tThe SMF1 replies with a Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response.\n4.\tIf the UE receives PDU Session Modification Command, the UE may decide to initiate the PDU Session Establishment procedure described in clause 4.3.2.2, to the same DN with the following differences:\nIn Step 1 of clause 4.3.2.2.1, according to the SSC mode, UE generates a new PDU Session ID and initiates the PDU Session Establishment Request using the new PDU Session ID. The new PDU Session ID is included as PDU Session ID in the NAS request message and the Old PDU Session ID which indicates the existing PDU Session to be released is also provided to AMF in the NAS request message.\nIn Step 2 of clause 4.3.2.2.1, if SMF reallocation was requested in Step 2 of this clause, the AMF selects a different SMF. Otherwise, the AMF sends the Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request to the same SMF serving the Old PDU Session ID.\nIf target DNAI information has been received from old SMF (i.e. SMF1), for the PDU Session toward same DNN and S-NSSAI the AMF selects the new SMF using the stored target DNAI information. The AMF includes the target DNAI in the Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request and deletes the stored target DNAI information. If the AMF has received the SM Context ID from the old SMF, the AMF includes the SM Context ID in the Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request.\nIn Step 3 of clause 4.3.2.2.1, if the SMF is not to be reallocated, the AMF include both PDU Session ID and Old PDU Session ID in Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request. The SMF detects that the PDU Session establishment request is related to the trigger in step 2 based on the presence of an Old PDU Session ID in the Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request.\nIn Step 3 of clause 4.3.2.2.1, the SMF stores the new PDU Session ID and selects a new PDU Session Anchor (i.e. UPF2) for the new PDU Session.\nIf the new SMF receives an SM Context ID in the Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request, the new SMF retrieves the AF Coordination Information by sending a Nsmf_PDUSession_ContextRequest to the old SMF and indicates that \"AF Coordination Information\" part of 5G SM Context is requested.\nIf the SMF receives a target DNAI in the Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request, the SMF selects the new PDU Session Anchor using the target DNAI.\nIf the AF Coordination Information in the Nsmf_PDUSession_ContextRequest Response includes a notification correlation id associated with an \"uplink buffering\" indication, the SMF may also indicate PSA2 to buffer the uplink data associated with the same notification correlation id in the PCC Rules.\nIf the PCC Rules received from the PCF as in step 7b or step 9 in clause 4.3.2.2.1 indicate that a late notification is requested by the AF (directly or via NEF), the SMF sends a late notification to the AF before step 11 of clause 4.3.2.2.1 in Nsmf_EventExposure_Notify service operation, as in step 4a or step 4c in Figure 4.3.6.3-1 (directly or via NEF, respectively). The late notification contains the Source DNAI and the UE IP address in the Source DNAI included in the AF Coordination Information as received in the Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Response from the old SMF.\nIf the SMF received a negative notification response from the AF, the SMF may stop the procedure. This is defined in Figure 4.3.6.3-1. Otherwise the SMF continue the following procedures to activate the UP path of the new PDU Session. The SMF may also indicate PSA2 to stop buffering and start forwarding uplink data.\n5.\tAfter the new PDU Session is established the UE starts using the IP address/prefix associated with the new PDU Session for all new traffic and may also proactively move existing traffic flow (where possible) from the old PDU Session to the new PDU Session.\nNOTE:\tThe mechanisms used by the UE to proactively move existing traffic flows from one IP address/prefix to another are outside the scope of 3GPP specifications.\n6.\tThe old PDU Session is released as described in clause 4.3.4 either by the UE before the timer provided in step 3 expires (e.g. once the UE has consolidated all traffic on new PDU Session or if the session is no more needed) or by the SMF upon expiry of this timer.",

      "content": "Clause 4.3.5.3 describes a procedure for service continuity with SSC mode 3 that uses the multi-homed PDU Session described in clause 5.6.4.3 of TS 23.501 [2]. In this case the SMF prepares a new PDU Session Anchor first and then notifies the UE of the existence of a new IP prefix, as depicted in figure 4.3.5.3-1. This procedure is applicable only to PDU Sessions of IPv6 type.\nFigure 4.3.5.3-1: Change of PDU Session Anchor with IPv6 Multi homed PDU Session\nThe UE has an established PDU Session with the PDU Session Anchor (i.e. UPF1 in Figure 4.3.5.3-1). The PDU Session's User Plane involves at least the (R)AN and the PDU Session Anchor.\n1.\tAt some point the SMF decides to allocate the PDU Session with a new PDU Session Anchor.\n2.\tThe SMF selects a new UPF and using N4 configures the UPF as a new PDU Session Anchor (i.e. UPF2 in Figure 4.3.5.3-1) of the multi-homed PDU Session. In the process a new IPv6 prefix (IP@2) is allocated for the PDU Session. If the PCF has subscribed to the IP allocation/release event, the SMF performs a Session Management Policy Modification procedure as defined in clause 4.16.5 to provide the new allocated IPv6 prefix to the PCF. The PCF invokes Nbsf_Management_Update service operation to register the tuple (IPv6 prefix, PCF id) for the PDU session identified by (SUPI, DNN, S-NSSAI) in the BSF.\nIf the runtime coordination between 5GC and AF is enabled based on local configuration, according to the indication of \"AF acknowledgment to be expected\" included in AF subscription to SMF events, the SMF sends an early notification to the AF after the new UPF (new PSA) is selected and waits for a notification response from the AF. If the SMF receives a negative notification response from the AF, the SMF may stop the procedure. This is further defined in Figure 4.3.6.3-1.\n3.\tThe SMF selects a Branching Point (BP) UPF as described in Clause of 6.3.3 of TS 23.501 [2]. The selection of BP UPF may consider the location of UPF1 and UPF2 to ensure a suitable location of the BP UPF relative to the UPF1 and the UPF2.\nNOTE 1:\tIf BP UPF is co-located with one of PDU Session Anchors, steps between SMF and BP UPF can be skipped.\n4.\tThe SMF configures via N4 the UPF selected in step 3 (BP UPF in Figure 4.3.5.3-1) as a Branching Point for the multi-homed PDU Session. It provides the Branching Point with the necessary UL traffic forwarding rules (related with the prefix of the IPv6 source address of UL traffic). Also, the SMF provides AN Tunnel Info for N3 tunnel setup and CN Tunnel Info for N9 tunnel setup to the BP UPF and obtains CN Tunnel Info from the BP UPF.\n5-6. The SMF performs N4 Session Modification procedure with PSAs. During this procedure, the SMF provides CN Tunnel Info received from the BP UPF to set up an N9 tunnel between BP and PSAs. The SMF may also indicate local PSA2 to buffer the uplink data.\n7.\tThe SMF invokes the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation containing N2 SM Information with CN Tunnel Info for the N3 tunnel setup.\n8.\tThe AMF sends an N2 Request including N2 SM Information received from the SMF to the (R)AN. The (R)AN acknowledges to the AMF with an N2 Response.\n9a.\tThe AMF carries the N2 Response sent by the (R)AN to the SMF by invoking the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext service operation.\n9b.\tThe SMF responds to Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext service operation from the AMF.\n10-11.\tIf the runtime coordination between 5GC and AF is enabled based on local configuration as specified in clause 4.3.6.3, according to the indication of \"AF acknowledgment to be expected\" is included in AF subscription to SMF events, the SMF sends a late notification to the AF and waits for a notification response from the AF. If the SMF receives a negative notification response from the AF, the SMF may stop the procedure. This is further defined in Figure 4.3.6.3-1.\nThe SMF notifies the UE of the availability of the new IP prefix. This is performed using an IPv6 Router Advertisement message (RFC 4861 [6]). The SMF sends a Router Advertisement to the UE via the new PSA with a new prefix (IP@2) and sends another Router Advertisement to the UE via the old PSA with the old prefix (IP@1) and zero value in the preferred lifetime field and a value in the valid lifetime field according to RFC 4862 [8]. The UE shall update the valid lifetime of the old prefix (IP@1) to the signalled value regardless of the remaining lifetime. The valid lifetime value indicates the time how long the SMF is willing to keep the old prefix. The valid lifetime value may be decided by SMF based on local configuration.\nThe UE starts using IP@2 for all new traffic and may also proactively move existing traffic flow (where possible) from IP@1 to IP@2.\nNOTE 2:\tThe mechanisms used by the UE to proactively move existing traffic flows from one IP prefix to another are outside the scope of 3GPP specifications.\n12.\tAfter the timer expires, the SMF releases the UE's old IPv6 prefix (IP@1). At this point the UE implicitly releases the old IP prefix. The SMF sends an N4 Session Modification Request to the BP to release UP resource for N9 tunnel between the BP and old PSA.\n13.\tThe SMF releases the old PDU Session context with the old PDU Session Anchor (UPF1 in Figure 4.3.5.3-1). If the PCF has subscribed to the IP allocation/release event, the SMF performs a Session Management Policy Modification procedure as defined in clause 4.16.5 to notify the PCF of the IPv6 prefix release. The PCF shall invoke Nbsf_Management_Update service operation to remove the tuple (IPv6prefix, PCF id) for the PDU session identified by (SUPI, DNN,S-NSSAI) in BSF.\n14-18.\tThe SMF may optionally release the Branching Point from the User Plane path. In step 14, the SMF may also indicate PSA2 to stop buffering and start forwarding uplink data.",

Alternatively the routing information to the application located in the target local DN can be determined by the AF based on the new DNAI, in which case the AF can invoke the AF triggered influence on traffic routing procedure targeting single UE as described in clause 4.3.6.4, which assists the SMF in generation of the routing rule on the Target UL CL towards PSA3 (i.e. towards the application located in the target local DN). It is up to network configuration whether the routing information to the application located in the target local DN is configured in the SMF or in the AF.\nNOTE 6:\tWhen session continuity upon UL CL relocation is used the AF can also trigger mechanisms that are out of the scope of this specification (e.g. IP-level or HTTP-level redirection) by which the traffic is redirected towards the application in the target local DN. Based on this redirection the UE starts using a new destination IP address which leads the Target UL CL to force the traffic towards PSA3.\n10.\tWhen session continuity upon UL CL relocation is used, detection of no active traffic over the N9 forwarding tunnel is performed during a time interval provisioned by SMF for User Plane inactivity report in order to release the N9 forwarding tunnel. The detection can be done by Source UL CL, which notifies the SMF of no active traffic over the N9 forwarding tunnel.\nNOTE 7:\tIt is up to network configuration whether the detection of no active traffic is performed by the Source UL CL or the Target UL CL. As an alternative to the detection of no active traffic, the AF can send an explicit notification to the SMF when traffic to/from this UE ceases to exist, leading the SMF to release the Source UL CL and the Source UPF (PSA2).\n11.\tThe SMF releases via N4 the PSA2.\n12.\tThe SMF releases the Source Branching Point or the Source UL CL.\nNOTE 8:\tIf the Source Branching Point or UL CL and the PSA2 are co-located in a single UPF then steps 11 and 12 can be merged.",

      "content": "This procedure allows for Ethernet PDU Sessions to change the PDU Session Anchor (PSA) while the session remains set up. Originally the Ethernet PDU Session goes via the Source UPF acting as the PSA. The Ethernet context which contains all Ethernet specific information including the MAC address of the UE and possibly its VLAN tag(s) is reported from the Source PSA UPF to the SMF. It is possible to report multiple MAC addresses (with their VLAN tag(s)) if these are reachable via the UE.\nThe SMF determines whether and when a serving PDU Session anchor for an Ethernet PDU Session needs to be changed and selects the Target PSA UPF, establishes the N4 session at the Target PSA UPF. The information within the Ethernet context is sent to the Target UPF. Based on the information in the Ethernet context, the Target PSA UPF may take action to update the Ethernet forwarding in the data network.\nFigure 4.3.5.8-1: Ethernet PDU Session Anchor Relocation\nInitially, the Ethernet PDU Session is established with the user data going via the Source UPF. The Source UPF acts as the PSA.\n1.\tThe Source UPF reports the Ethernet context which contains all Ethernet specific information including the MAC address of the UE and possibly its VLAN tag(s) that the UPF has learned from the UE side to the SMF. In the case of any changes in the Ethernet context, the change is updated to the SMF so that the SMF maintains an up-to-date state of the Ethernet context. This signalling is realized based on N4 reporting.\n2.\tThe UPF's report is acknowledged.\n3-5. In the case of handover, the RAN handover preparation and execution is followed by path switch signalling to the AMF and corresponding signalling to SMF, as defined in clause 4.9.1.2.\n6.\tThe SMF decides that the PSA is to be changed for the Ethernet PDU Session and selects the Target UPF that will act as the new PSA. The decision may be triggered by a mobility event, such as receiving the message in step 5.\n7.\tThe Target UPF N4 session is established. The SMF provides the N3 tunnel endpoint used by RAN.\n8.\tThe establishment of the new N4 session is acknowledged from the Target UPF to the SMF. The UPF provides its N3 tunnel endpoint.\n9-10.\tIn the case of handover, the SMF signals to the RAN via the AMF to provide the Path Switch Request Ack, which includes the update of the uplink N3 tunnel endpoint to the target UPF. This signalling is defined in clause 4.9.1.2. In steps 9-10, an indication is sent from the SMF via the AMF to the RAN node indicating that the RAN node should not expect to receive an end marker packet. The RAN node may skip trying to reorder the downlink packets.\n11-12.\tIf there is no handover and the UE is in connected mode, the SMF sends PDU Session Modify Request message to the RAN via the AMF, which includes the update of the uplink N3 tunnel endpoint to the target UPF. The RAN acknowledges the message. The RAN node does not need to reorder the downlink packets.\nNOTE 1:\tDue to the change in the end to end path, packet re-ordering can occur both for the handover and no handover cases. If necessary, upper layer protocols can ensure in sequence delivery.\nAfter steps 9-10 or 11-12, uplink Ethernet frames pass via the target UPF. Downlink Ethernet frames may continue to be delivered from the source UPF to the RAN node. In the case of handover, the Ethernet frames are forwarded from the source RAN node to the target RAN node.\n13-14.\tThe SMF sends an N4 Session Modification Request to the Target UPF which includes the information in Ethernet context (i.e. MAC address and VLAN tag(s)) and a trigger for updating the Ethernet forwarding (next step). The Target UPF acknowledges by an N4 Session Modification Response.\n15.\tThe Target UPF may assist in the update of Ethernet forwarding tables of Ethernet switches in the DN via a variety of mechanisms, the use of which are specific to the DN and the specification of which are out-of-scope for 3GPP.\nNOTE 2:\tThe UPF acting as a switch in the DN, can for example issue a Gratuitous ARP (GARP) containing the MAC address(es) of the UE that has switched to the new anchor, or the UPF can send an unsolicited Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) Neighbor Advertisement message indicating the UE MAC addresses, or the UPF can generate a uplink Ethernet frame with the UE's MAC addresses as source MAC addresses (and possibly its VLAN tag(s)) and configurable payload which will be dropped by endhosts, or the UPF can send another message or Ethernet frame compatible with DN protocols.\nIn the case of a central controller in the Ethernet network which sets the forwarding tables, the central controller can be instructed that the given MAC address is reachable at the new location.\nWhen multiple MAC addresses are present in the Ethernet context, the update of the Ethernet forwarding is performed for each MAC address.\n16.\tThe N4 session is released at the Source UPF. The source UPF may wait for a configurable period before it stops delivering downlink Ethernet frames for the given PDU Session.\n17.\tThe N4 session release is acknowledged from the Source UPF to the SMF.",

      "content": "Clause 4.3.6 describes the procedures between an Application Function and the SMF to maintain an efficient user plane path and/or to provide N6-LAN service function chaining for Application Functions that require it.\nAs described in clauses 5.6.7 and 5.6.16 of TS 23.501 [2], an Application Function may send requests to influence SMF routeing decisions for User Plane traffic of PDU Sessions. The AF requests may influence UPF (re)selection and allow routeing of user traffic to a local access (identified by a DNAI) to a Data Network and/or influence the steering of user traffic to service function chain(s) identified by SFC identifier(s). The AF may also provide in its request subscriptions to SMF events. A V-SMF supporting HR-SBO provides, SUPI, an indication of support for HR-SBO, and HPLMN DNN and S-NSSAI related to the PDU session to the L-PSA UPF at PDU session establishment.\nNOTE 1:\tNEF uses the SUPI to derive PLMN ID of the UE.\nThe following cases can be distinguished:\nNOTE 2:\tSuch requests target an on-going PDU Session.\nWhen receiving an AF request on Application Function influence on traffic routing targeting an individual UE IP address the NEF needs to determine whether the target PDU Session is working in HR-SBO mode. If the target PDU Session is NOT working in HR-SBO mode (non roaming or LBO PDU Session) then the NEF contacts the PCF of the PDU Session as further defined in the clause 4.3.6.4. If the target PDU Session is working in HR-SBO mode, the NEF does not contact the PCF of the PDU session but needs to store the AF request in UDR as defined in clause 4.3.6.5.\nThe NEF determines whether the PDU Session that the AF requests to influence is working in HR-SBO mode or not and in the former case determines the HPLMN of the UE, the DNN and S-NSSAI of the PDU Session as follows:\nIf the AF has determined based on procedure in clause 4.3.6.5.2 that the PDU session is home routed, the AF provides IP address of the UE (assigned by HPLMN) and HPLMN ID, HPLMN DNN and S-NSSAI, and the NEF determines if the PDU session is subject to HR-SBO using the provided information and proceeds according to clause 4.3.6.5.2.\nIf the AF has provided an IP address of the UE known to the AF (IP address not assigned by HPLMN), and DNN and S-NSSAI, the NEF determines if the PDU session is subject to HR-SBO based on local configuration. If PDU session is not subject to HR-SBO, the NEF proceeds according to clause 4.3.6.4. If PDU session is subject to HR-SBO the NEF determines the HPLMN and proceeds from according to clause 4.3.6.5.2, excluding step 0a.\nNOTE 3:\tThe DNN can be unique for a PLMN (see TS 23.003 [33]) and can be mapped to a HPLMN, or the IP address can be within a range that can be mapped to a HPLMN.\nIf the AF has not provided the (H)PLMN ID, DNN and S-NSSAI:\n-\tIf the IP address of the UE in the AF request is a private IP address, the NEF determines if the request relates to HR-SBO or not based on local configuration, or based on interactions with UPF, since the V-SMF shall have provided an indication that the PDU Session is working in HR-SBO mode, SUPI and the HPLMN DNN and S-NSSAI of the PDU Session to the L-PSA UPF. If the request relates to HR-SBO, the NEF proceeds according to clause 4.3.6.5.3, otherwise it proceeds according to clause 4.3.6.4.\nNOTE 4:\tWhether or not NEF interact with UPF to determine if HR-SBO applies is based on configuration. If NEF does not interact with UPF, the 5GC NF (e.g. SMF/UPF, NEF) in PLMN can be configured to have separate private IP address ranges for HR-SBO PDU Sessions. This would allow NEF to distinguish AF request for influence on traffic routing for HR-SBO PDU Sessions from non-roaming and LBO PDU Sessions.\n-\tIf the IP address of the UE in the AF request is a public IP address:\n-\tIf this Public IP address belongs to an IP range not owned by the PLMN of the NEF, then the target PDU Session is working in HR-SBO mode and the NEF proceeds according to clause 4.3.6.5.4.\n-\tIf the UE IP Address in the AF request is an IP address NATed by the PLMN that the NEF belongs to, the NEF invokes steps 3 to 6 of clause 4.15.10 to get the corresponding private UE IP address. If HR-SBO applies, the V-SMF shall have provided an indication that the PDU Session is working in HR-SBO mode, SUPI and the HPLMN DNN and S-NSSAI of the PDU Session to the L-PSA UPF. Thus, the NEF can also receive these parameters and determines if the AF request relates to HR-SBO PDU Session, the NEF proceeds according to clause 4.3.6.5.3. Otherwise the NEF proceeds according to clause 4.3.6.4.\nNOTE 5:\tIn this Release, the HPLMN allows HR-SBO for a PDU session only if the UE IP address of the PDU Session has not been allocated in a range that may overlap with other PDU sessions to the same DNN and S-NSSAI of that HPLMN.\nNOTE 6:\tIt is assumed that the NEF is configured with the NATed IP range of its own PLMN. It is assumed that the NEF is configured based on HR-SBO roaming agreements for the Public IP address ranges with an HPLMN ID.\nNOTE 7:\tWhether the AF needs to use the NEF or not is according to local deployment. If the AF request is expected to possibly address PDU Sessions in HR-SBO mode, then the AF sends its requests via the NEF.\nWhen AF requests are routed (by the AF or by the NEF) to an individual PCF this may use the BSF. This case applies to both AF influence on traffic routing as well as AF influence on Service Function Chaining. This is described in clause 4.3.6.4.\n-\tAF requests described in clause 5.6.7 of TS 23.501 [2] or clause 5.6.16 of TS 23.501 [2] targeting a group of UE(s), or any UE accessing a combination of DNN and S-NSSAI and optionally PLMN ID of the DNN and S-NSSAI, or targeting individual UE(s) by one or more GPSI(s) or targeting UEs with External Subscriber Category(s) which can be combined with External Group ID(s) or any UE as described in table 5.6.7-1. These AF requests may also affect UE(s) with an established PDU session. For such requests the AF shall contact the NEF and the NEF stores the AF request information in the UDR. For non-roaming and LBO cases, the PCF(s) receive a corresponding notification if they had subscribed to the create/update/delete operations of the AF request information corresponding to UDR Data Keys / Data Sub-Keys. This is defined in clause 6.3.7.2 of TS 23.501 [2] and further described in clause 4.3.6.2. For HR-SBO case, V-SMF(s) receive a corresponding notification if it has subscribed to the create/update/delete operation of the AF request information corresponding to UDR Data Keys /Data Sub-Keys, this is described in clause 4.3.6.5. For a single UE, NEF determines if HR-SBO applies for the PDU session based on the local configuration using the received GPSI. For \"any UE\", both PCF(s) and SMF(s) (via NEF) may need to subscribe to creates/updates/deletes of AF influence on traffic routing data in UDR depending on if a specific PLMN is targeted.\nNOTE 8:\tSuch requests can target on-going or future PDU Sessions.\nIf the AF request targets any UE the procedure described in clause 4.3.6.5 may also be performed. In that case if HPLMN ID, HPLMN DNN and HPLMN S-NSSAI have been provided (see clause 4.3.6.5.2), if the HPLMN ID, HPLMN DNN and HPLMN S-NSSAI have not been provided by the AF, the NEF determines the HPLMN DNN and HPLMN S-NSSAI as described in clause 4.3.6.5.5.\nThis Release of the specification does not support AF influence on traffic routing for HR-SBO PDU session, if the AF request targets an external group ID, or UE(s) identified by SUPI.\nIf the AF interacts with 5GC via the NEF, the NEF performs the following mappings or determinations where needed:\n-\tMap the AF-Service-Identifier into DNN and S-NSSAI combination, determined by local configuration.\n-\tMap the AF-Service-Identifier into a list of DNAI(s) and Routing Profile ID(s) determined by local configuration.\nThe NEF can only provide this mapping when the DNAI(s) being used by the applications are statically defined. When the DNAI(s) where applications are instantiated may vary dynamically, the AF should provide the target DNAI(s) in its request together with either Routing Profile ID(s) or with N6 traffic routing information.\n-\tMap the GPSI in Target UE Identifier into SUPI, according to information received from UDM.\n-\tMap the External Group Identifier in Target UE Identifier into Internal Group Identifier, according to information received from UDM.\n-\tMap the External Subscriber Category(s) and any UE, or External Subscriber Category and External Group ID(s) to, Internal Group ID(s) or Internal Group ID(s) and Subscriber Category(s).\n-\tMap the geographical area in Spatial Validity Condition into areas of validity, determined by local configuration.\n-\tDetermine whether an AF request targeting an UE IP address corresponds to HR-SBO and if yes determine the HPLMN of UE, the DNN/S-NSSAI of the PDU Session based on the description given above.\nNOTE 9:\tAs a user can be associated with multiple Subscriber Category(s), some values of Subscriber Category(s) can correspond to an SLA between an application provider represented by an AF and the 5GC operator. In the NEF API, the combination of application identifier and External Subscriber Category can also be used to refer to this SLA.",

The content of this service operation (AF request) is defined in clause 5.2.6.7. The request contains also an AF Transaction Id. If it subscribes to events related with PDU Sessions the AF indicates also where it desires to receive the corresponding notifications (AF notification reporting information).\nTo update or remove an existing request, the AF invokes a Nnef_TrafficInfluence_Update or Nnef_TrafficInfluence_Delete service operation providing the corresponding AF Transaction Id.\nThe Nnef_TrafficInfluence_Create (initiated by target AF) or Nnef_TrafficInfluence_Update (initiated by source AF or target AF) service operation may be used for the case of AF instance change. If Nnef_TrafficInfluence_Update service operation is invoked, the NEF is required to update the subscription resource. The Nnef_TrafficInfluence_Update service operation may include an updated notification target address. The updated subscription resource is used by the target AF.\nNOTE 2:\tIf the source AF transfers the application context to the target AF, then target AF may create new subscription via Nnef_TrafficInfluence_Create operation or update existing subscription via Nnef_TrafficInfluence_Update. However, whether and how the application context transfer is done is out of this specification.\n2.\tThe AF sends its request to the NEF. If the request is sent directly from the AF to the PCF, the AF reaches the PCF selected for the existing PDU Session by configuration or by invoking Nbsf_management_Discovery service.\nThe NEF ensures the necessary authorization control, including throttling of AF requests and as described in clause 4.3.6.1, mapping from the information provided by the AF into information needed by the 5GC.\n3.\t(in the case of Nnef_TrafficInfluence_Create or Update): The NEF stores the AF request information in the UDR (Data Set = Application Data; Data Subset, Data Key = AF Transaction Internal ID, S-NSSAI and DNN and/or Internal Group Identifier(s) and/or Subscriber Category(s) or SUPI). The Data Subset identifies whether the information relates to AF traffic influence request information for traffic routing or AF traffic influence request information for service function chaining, as described in Table 5.2.12.2.1-1.\nNOTE 3:\tBoth the AF Transaction Internal ID and S-NSSAI and DNN and/or Internal Group Identifier(s) and/or Subscriber Category(s) or SUPI are regarded as Data Key when the AF request information are stored into the UDR, see Table 5.2.12.2.1-1. The Subscriber Category(s) is determined by NEF as described in clause 4.3.6.1.\n(in the case of Nnef_TrafficInfluence_delete): The NEF deletes the AF requirements in the UDR (Data Set = Application Data; Data Subset, Data Key = AF Transaction Internal ID). The Data Subset identifies whether the information relates to AF traffic influence request information for traffic routing or AF traffic influence request information for service function chaining.\nThe NEF responds to the AF.\n4.\tThe PCF(s) that have subscribed to modifications of AF requests receive(s) a Nudr_DM_Notify notification of data change from the UDR. The Data Subset identifies whether the information relates to AF traffic influence request information for traffic routing or AF traffic influence request information for service function chaining.\n5.\tThe PCF determines if existing PDU Sessions are potentially impacted by the AF request. For each of these PDU Sessions, the PCF updates the SMF with corresponding new policy information about the PDU Session by invoking Npcf_SMPolicyControl_UpdateNotify service operation as described in steps 5 and 6 in clause 4.16.5.\nThe PCF validates whether the SFC identifier (if available) corresponds to an authorized SFC for the AF based on local configuration. If the validation has succeeded the PCF maps the SFC identifier to the corresponding Traffic Steering Policy identifier (i.e. TSP ID).\nThe PCF includes the Traffic Steering Policy ID(s) in the AF influence on traffic routing Enforcement Control information and/or N6-LAN Traffic Steering Enforcement Control information of the relevant PCC rule as defined in clause 6.3.1 of TS 23.503 [20]. The PCF also includes the Metadata in the N6-LAN Traffic Steering Enforcement Control information of the PCC rule when Metadata was provided by the AF.\nIf the AF request includes a notification reporting request for UP path change, the PCF includes in the PCC rule(s) the information required for reporting the event, including the Notification Target Address pointing to the NEF or AF and the Notification Correlation ID containing the AF Transaction Internal ID.\nIf the AF request includes an EAS Correlation indication or indication of traffic correlation, PCF includes in the PCC rule(s) an EAS Correlation indication or indication of traffic correlation and a Traffic Correlation ID corresponding to a set of UEs that AF request aims at, also if AF request includes a common EAS IP address or common DNAI for a set of UEs, PCC rule includes the common EAS IP address or common DNAI.\nIn the case of AF influence on traffic routing, the PCF may, optionally, use service experience analytics per UP path, as defined in clause 6.4.3 of TS 23.288 [50], to provide an updated list of DNAI(s) to the SMF.\nThe PCF may use the \"Subscriber categories\" as defined in \"PDU Session policy control subscription information\" in table 6.2-2 of TS 23.503 [20] to determine whether the PDU Session is impacted by the AF request.\n6.\tWhen the updated policy information about the PDU Session is received from the PCF, the SMF may take appropriate actions to reconfigure the User plane of the PDU Session.\nIn the case of AF influence on traffic routing, examples of actions are:\n-\tThe SMF may consider service experience analytics and/or DN Performance analytics per UP path (i.e. including UPF and/or DNAI and/or AS instance) as defined in clauses 6.4.3 and 6.14.3, respectively, of TS 23.288 [50] before taking any actions.\n-\tDetermining a target DNAI.\n-\tDetermining if a common DNAI needs to be used as a target DNAI.\n-\tAdding, replacing or removing a UPF in the data path to e.g. act as an UL CL or a Branching Point e.g. as described in clause 4.3.5.\n-\tAllocate a new Prefix to the UE (when IPv6 multi-Homing applies).\n-\tUpdating the UPF in the target DNAI with AF influence on traffic routing control parameters as described in clause 5.6.7.1 of TS 23.501 [2].\n-\tSubscribe to notifications from the AMF for an Area of Interest via Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe service operation.\n-\tDetermining whether to relocate PSA UPF considering the user plane latency requirements provided by the AF (see clause 6.3.6 of TS 23.548 [74]).\nWhen the updated policy information about the PDU Session is received from the PCF, the SMF may take appropriate actions to assist the EAS discovery and re-discovery for PDU Session with Session Breakout connectivity model such as:\n-\tRetrieve the EAS deployment information as defined in clause 6.2.3.4.1 of TS 23.548 [74].\n-\tProviding DNS message handling rule to forward DNS messages of the UE and/or report when detecting DNS messages as defined in clause 6.2.3.2.2 of TS 23.548 [74].\nIn the case of AF influence on Service Function Chaining, the SMF may take appropriate actions to enforce the N6-LAN traffic steering control:\n-\tProvide N6-LAN traffic steering control parameters to UPF as described in clause 5.6.16 of TS 23.501 [2].\n7.\tThe SMF may decide whether it is required to send the target DNAI to the AMF for triggering SMF/I-SMF (re)selection and then inform the target DNAI information for the current PDU session or for the next PDU session to AMF via Nsmf_PDUSession_SMContextStatusNotify service operation.",

Further processing of the SMF notification depends on the receiving NF, as shown in steps 2a and 2c.\nIf immediate reporting flag is included in AF subscription for user plane management event as described in clause 5.6.7 of TS 23.501 [2], SMF sends notification, as shown in steps 2a or 2c.\n2a.\tIf early notification via NEF is requested by the AF, the SMF notifies the NEF of the target DNAI or candidate DNAI(s) of the PDU Session or indication of EAS rediscovery and may indicate capability of supporting EAS IP replacement in 5GC by invoking Nsmf_EventExposure_Notify service operation. The SMF may provide the target AF ID if it determines that the target DNAI is not supported by the source AF as specified in TS 23.548 [74]. The SMF may consider the UE location and available DNAI list provided by AF to select the closest available DNAI(s) as candidate DNAI(s). The SMF may also provide the candidate DNAI(s) in a prioritized order.\nNOTE 2:\tFor the reporting of candidate DNAIs from SMF/NEF to AF, only early notification is used.\n2b.\tWhen the NEF receives Nsmf_EventExposure_Notify, the NEF performs information mapping (e.g. AF Transaction Internal ID provided in Notification Correlation ID to AF Transaction ID, SUPI to GPSI, etc.) as applicable according to clause 5.6.7 of TS 23.501 [2] and triggers the appropriate Nnef_TrafficInfluence_Notify message. In this case, step 2c is not applicable.\n2c.\tIf early direct notification is requested by the AF, the SMF notifies the AF of the target DNAI or candidate DNAI(s) of the PDU Session or indication of EAS rediscovery and may indicate capability of supporting EAS IP replacement in 5GC by invoking Nsmf_EventExposure_Notify service operation. The SMF may provide the target AF ID if it determines that the target DNAI is not supported by the source AF.\n2d.\tThe AF replies to Nnef_TrafficInfluence_Notify by invoking Nnef_TrafficInfluence_AppRelocationInfo service operation either immediately or after any required application relocation in the target DNAI is completed. The AF may include N6 traffic routing details corresponding to the target DNAI and /or the 'uplink buffering' indication to indicate that buffering of uplink traffic to the target DNAI is needed. The AF may include Information for EAS IP Replacement in 5GC. AF may reply in negative e.g. if the AF determines that the application relocation cannot be completed successfully and/or on time.\nNOTE 3:\tThe maximum time the new PSA is to buffer UL data relates to the maximum delay between steps 4a-4c and step 4f/4g of Figure 4.3.6.3-1. SMF local policies can control this maximum time.\nNOTE 4:\tThe traffic being buffered is the traffic associated with the PCC rule that has requested the notification.\n2d-a.\tIf information sent via Nnef_TrafficInfluence_Create is to be changed e.g. N6 traffic routing details corresponding to the target DNAI, the AF invokes Nnef_TrafficInfluence_update service operation in order for PCF to be able to include this information in PCC rules sent to SMF.\nIf the AF includes information such as N6 traffic routing details corresponding to the target DNAI in Nnef_TrafficInfluence_AppRelocationInfo it shall include the same information in Nnef_TrafficInfluence_update.\nIf common DNAI or common EAS is required for set of UEs and AF is used to select common DNAI or common EAS according to operator's configuration, the AF determines the common DNAI/EAS according to the candidate DNAI(s) of each UE of the set reported by SMF(s) serving the set of UEs, then informs SMF(s) of each UE of the selected common DNAI as clause 6.2.3.2.6 of TS 23.548 [74] or the selected common EAS as clause 6.2.3.2.5 of TS 23.548 [74].\n2e.\tWhen the NEF receives Nnef_TrafficInfluence_AppRelocationInfo, the NEF triggers the appropriate Nsmf_EventExposure_AppRelocationInfo message.\n2e-a.\tWhen the NEF receives Nnef_TrafficInfluence_update, the NEF triggers step 3a as in Figure 4.3.6.2-1 or step 2 of Figure 4.3.6.4-1 if targeting an individual UE by a UE address.\n2f.\tThe AF replies to Nsmf_EventExposure_Notify by invoking Nsmf_EventExposure_AppRelocationInfo service operation either immediately or after any required application relocation in the target DNAI is completed. The AF may include N6 traffic routing details corresponding to the target DNAI and /or the 'uplink buffering' indication to indicate that buffering of uplink traffic to the target DNAI is needed. The AF may include Information for EAS IP Replacement in 5GC. AF may reply in negative e.g. if the AF determines that the application relocation cannot be completed successfully on time.\n2f-a.\tIf information sent via Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create is to be changed e.g. N6 traffic routing details corresponding to the target DNAI, the AF invokes Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update service operation in order for PCF to be able to include this information in PCC rules sent to SMF.\nIf the AF includes information such as N6 traffic routing details corresponding to the target DNAI in Nsmf_EventExposure_AppRelocationInfo it shall include the same information in Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update.\n3.\tThe SMF enforces the change of DNAI or addition, change, or removal of a UPF. This may correspond to the mechanisms described in Figure 4.3.5.6-1 or in Figure 4.3.5.7-1.\nIf the runtime coordination between 5GC and AF is enabled based on local configuration, according to the indication of \"AF acknowledgment to be expected\" included in AF subscription to SMF events, the SMF may wait for a response from the AF to the early notification before this step. The SMF does not perform this step until it receives a positive response from the AF, as described in clause 5.6.7 of TS 23.501 [2].\n4a.\tIf late notification via NEF is requested by the AF, the SMF notifies the NEF of the target DNAI of the PDU Session or indication of EAS rediscovery or new serving PLMN ID, HPLMN DNN and S-NSSAI of the PDU session if serving PLMN is changed and local traffic offload is allowed and may indicate capability of supporting EAS IP replacement in 5GC by invoking Nsmf_EventExposure_Notify service operation. The SMF may provide the target AF ID if it determines that the target DNAI is not supported by the source AF.\nIf the runtime coordination between 5GC and AF is enabled based on local configuration, according to the indication of \"AF acknowledgment to be expected\" included in AF subscription to SMF events, the SMF may send late notification and wait for a positive response from the AF before activating the new UP path, as described in clause 5.6.7 of TS 23.501 [2].\n4b.\tWhen the NEF receives Nsmf_EventExposure_Notify, the NEF performs information mapping (e.g. AF Transaction Internal ID provided in Notification Correlation ID to AF Transaction ID, SUPI to GPSI, etc.) as applicable according to clause 5.6.7 of TS 23.501 [2] and triggers the appropriate Nnef_TrafficInfluence_Notify message. In this case, step 4c is not applicable.\n4c.\tIf late direct notification is requested by the AF, the SMF notifies the AF of the target DNAI of the PDU Session or indication of EAS rediscovery or new serving PLMN ID, HPLMN DNN and S-NSSAI of the PDU session if serving PLMN is changed and local traffic offload is allowed and may indicate capability of supporting EAS IP replacement in 5GC by invoking Nsmf_EventExposure_Notify service operation. The SMF may provide the target AF ID if it determines that the target DNAI is not supported by the source AF.\n4d.\tWhen the AF receives either the Nnef_TrafficInfluence_Notify message or the Nsmf_EventExposure_Notify message, the AF checks whether it can serve the target DNAI. If the AF instance change is needed, the AF determines the proper target AF for the target DNAI (e.g. based on locally configured information or the AF ID provided by the SMF in step 4a or 4c) and performs the AF migration.\nNOTE 5:\tIf the source AF is already locally configured with information associated with the target DNAI, the source AF is assumed to use the locally configured information, even if it has received from the SMF target AF ID in a previous step above.\nNOTE 6:\tThe determination of the target AF for the target DNAI and the AF migration to the target AF are out of the scope of this release.\n4e.\tThe AF replies to Nnef_TrafficInfluence_Notify by invoking Nnef_TrafficInfluence_AppRelocationInfo service operation either immediately or after any required application relocation in the target DNAI is completed. AF includes N6 traffic routing details corresponding to the target DNAI or new serving PLMN ID for traffic offload if serving PLMN is changed and local traffic offload is allowed. AF may reply in negative e.g. if the AF determines that the application relocation cannot be completed successfully on time. Nnef_TrafficInfluence_AppRelocationInfo with positive response may indicate that buffering of uplink traffic to the target DNAI is no more needed.\nIf SMF has sent an EAS re-discovery request to the UE as defined in TS 23.548 [74], e.g. due to change of common EAS, the SMF sends an indication to the AF that an EAS re-discovery request has been sent to the UE.\nNOTE 7:\tThe action taken by the AF when receiving such an indication that an EAS re-discovery request has been sent to the UE is out of scope of 3GPP specifications.\n4e-a.\tIf information sent via Nnef_TrafficInfluence_Create/Update is to be changed e.g. N6 traffic routing details corresponding to the target DNAI, the AF invokes Nnef_TrafficInfluence_Create or Nnef_TrafficInfluence_Update service operation in order for PCF to be able to include this information in PCC rules sent to SMF. The Nnef_TrafficInfluence_Create shall be used if the AF is notified (e.g. in step 4b) that the UE IP address is changed and the initial Nnef_TrafficInfluence_Create was targeted to an individual UE address, otherwise the Nnef_TrafficInfluence_Update may be used.\nIf the AF includes information such as N6 traffic routing details corresponding to the target DNAI in Nnef_TrafficInfluence_AppRelocationInfo it shall include the same information in Nnef_TrafficInfluence_Create or Nnef_TrafficInfluence_Update, whichever is appropriate.\n4f.\tWhen the NEF receives Nnef_TrafficInfluence_AppRelocationInfo, the NEF triggers the appropriate Nsmf_EventExposure_AppRelocationInfo message.\n4f-a.\tWhen the NEF receives Nnef_TrafficInfluence_Create/update, the NEF triggers step 3a as in Figure 4.3.6.2-1 or step 2 of Figure 4.3.6.4-1 if targeting an individual UE by a UE address.\n4g.\tThe AF replies to Nsmf_EventExposure_Notify by invoking Nsmf_EventExposure_AppRelocationInfo service operation either immediately or after any required application relocation in the target DNAI is completed. AF includes N6 traffic routing details corresponding to the target DNAI. AF may reply in negative e.g. if the AF determines that the application relocation cannot be completed successfully on time. Nsmf_EventExposure_AppRelocationInfo with positive response may indicate that buffering of uplink traffic to the target DNAI is no more needed.\n4g-a.\tIf information sent via Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create/Update is to be changed e.g. N6 traffic routing details corresponding to the target DNAI, the AF invokes Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create or Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update service operation in order for PCF to be able to include this information in PCC rules sent to SMF. The Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create shall be used if the AF is notified (e.g. in step 4c) that the UE IP address is changed, otherwise the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update may be used.\nIf the AF includes information such as N6 traffic routing details corresponding to the target DNAI in Nsmf_EventExposure_AppRelocationInfo it shall include the same information in Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create or Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update, whichever is appropriate.",

      "content": "Figure 4.3.6.4-1: Handling an AF request targeting an individual UE address to the relevant PCF\nDepending on the AF deployment (see clause 6.2.10 of TS 23.501 [2]), the AF may send the AF request to PCF directly, in which case step 1 is skipped, or via the NEF.\n1.\t[Conditional] If the AF sends the AF request via NEF, the AF sends Nnef_TrafficInfluenceCreate/Update/Delete Request targeting an individual UE address to the NEF. This request corresponds to an AF request to influence traffic routing to a local network and/or to a service function chain that targets an individual UE address.\nWhen NEF receives an AF request from AF, the NEF ensures the necessary authorization control and as described in clause 4.3.6.1, mapping from the information provided by the AF into information needed by the 5GC. The NEF responds to the AF.\n2.\t[Conditional] AF/NEF consumes Nbsf_Management_Discovery service operation (providing at least the UE address) to find out the address of the relevant PCF if the PCF address is not available on the NEF based on local configuration, otherwise step 1 is skipped.\nNOTE 1:\tThe AF/NEF finds the BSF based on local configuration or using the NRF.\n3.\tBSF provides the PCF address in the Nbsf_Management_Discovery response to AF/NEF.\n4.\tIf step 1 was performed, NEF invokes the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization service to the PCF to transfer the AF request. If an AF sends the AF request directly to the PCF, AF invokes Npcf_PolicyAuthorization service and the PCF responds to the AF. To support the AF instance change, the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create (initiated by target AF) or Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update (initiated by source AF or target AF) service operation may be used.\nNOTE 2:\tIf the source AF transfers the application context to the target AF, then target AF may create new subscription via Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create or update existing subscription via Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update. However, whether and how the application context transfer is done is out of this specification.\n5.\tThe PCF authorizes the AF request. If the PCF determines that the requirements can't be authorized, it rejects the AF request. Once the PCF authorizes the AF request, the PCF updates the SMF with corresponding new PCC rule(s) with PCF initiated SM Policy Association Modification procedure as described in clause 4.16.5.2.\nThe PCF includes the Traffic Steering Policy ID(s) for AF influence on traffic routing Enforcement Control information and/or N6-LAN Traffic Steering Enforcement Control information in the relevant PCC rule as defined in clause 6.3.1 of TS 23.503 [20].\nThe PCF may, optionally, use service experience analytics per UP path, as defined in clause 6.4.3 of TS 23.288 [50], to provide a an updated list of DNAI(s) to the SMF.\nIf Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update service operation is invoked, the PCF is required to update the subscription resource. The Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update service operation may include an updated notification target address. The updated subscription resource is used by the target AF.\nWhen a PCC rule is received from the PCF, the SMF may take appropriate actions, when applicable, to reconfigure the User plane of the PDU Session.\nIn the case of AF influence on traffic routing, examples of actions are:\n-\tThe SMF may consider service experience analytics and/or DN Performance analytics per UP path (i.e. including UPF and/or DNAI and/or AS instance) as defined in clauses 6.4.3 and 6.14.3, respectively, of TS 23.288 [50] before taking any actions.\n-\tDetermining a target DNAI and adding, replacing or removing UPF(s) in the data path, e.g. to act as UL CL, Branching Point and/or PDU Session Anchor e.g. as described in clause 4.3.5.\n-\tAllocate a new Prefix to the UE (when IPv6 multi-Homing applies).\n-\tUpdating the UPF regarding the target DNAI with AF influence on traffic routing control parameters as described in clause 5.6.7.1 of TS 23.501 [2].\n-\tSubscribe to notifications from the AMF for an Area of Interest via Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe service operation.\n-\tDetermining whether to relocate PSA UPF considering the user plane latency requirements provided by the AF (see clause 6.3.6 of TS 23.548 [74]).\nIn the case of AF influence on Service Function Chaining, the SMF may take appropriate actions to enforce the N6-LAN traffic steering control:\n-\tProvide N6-LAN traffic steering control parameters to UPF as described in clause 5.6.16 of TS 23.501 [2].",

SMF proceeds with step 2 and step 3, the steps 5 to 9 are skipped;\n-\tThe UPF detects that the PDU Session has no data transfer for a specified Inactivity period as described in clause 4.4.2.2;\n-\tFor PDU sessions belonging to a network slice that is in the Partially Allowed NSSAI (see clause 5.15.17 in TS 23.501 [2]), or with Network Slice Area of Service not matching deployed Tracking Areas (see clause 5.15.18 of TS 23.501 [2]) the AMF notifies to the SMF that it has detected that the UE moved out of the network slice area of support or availability;\n-\tFor a LADN PDU Session, the AMF notifies to the SMF that the UE moved out of the LADN service area; or\n-\tThe AMF notifies to the SMF that the UE moved out of the Allowed Area.\nThe SMF may decide to release the UPF of N3 terminating point. In that case the SMF proceeds with step 2 and step 3. Otherwise, if the SMF decides to keep the UPF of N3 terminating points, the SMF proceeds with step 4. To assist SMF in this decision the SMF may make use of UE presence pattern in LADN service area based on UE mobility analytics from the NWDAF as described in clause 6.7.2 of TS 23.288 [50].\nThe SMF may make use of UE Communication analytics provided by NWDAF, as described in clause 6.7.3 of TS 23.288 [50], to determine the value of an Inactivity Timer for a PDU Session provided to the UPF.\n2.\tThe SMF may initiate an N4 Session Release procedure to release the intermediate UPF of N3 terminating point.

In this case, the UPF buffers the DL packets for this PDU Session or drops the DL packets for this PDU session or forwards the DL packets for this PDU session to the SMF, based on buffering instruction provided by the SMF as described in clause 5.8.3.2 or clause 5.8.3.3 of TS 23.501 [2]. If the PDU Session corresponds to a LADN and the UE moved out of the LADN service area, the SMF may notify the UPF to discard downlink data for the PDU Sessions and/or to not provide further Data Notification messages.\n5.\tThe SMF invokes the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation (PDU Session ID, N2 SM Information (N2 Resource Release Request (PDU Session ID))) to release the NG-RAN resources associated with the PDU Session.\n6.\tThe AMF sends the N2 PDU Session Resource Release Command including N2 SM information (N2 Resource Release Request (PDU Session ID)) received from the SMF via N2 to the NG-RAN.\n7.\tThe NG-RAN may issue NG-RAN specific signalling exchange (e.g. RRC Connection Reconfiguration) with the UE to release the NG-RAN resources related to the PDU Session received from the AMF in step 5.

The UE Context Retrieval procedure via NG-RAN is specified in TS 38.300 [9].\n3.\tNG-RAN to UE: RRC messages.\nNG-RAN determines whether the UE shall be transitioned to RRC_CONNECTED state or kept in RRC_INACTIVE (e.g. the latter in the case of Small Data Transmission as defined in TS 38.300 [9]).\n4a.\t[Conditional] N2 Path switch procedure.\nIf the accessed NG-RAN is different from the last serving NG-RAN and is able to retrieve the UE Context, the accessed NG-RAN node initiates N2 Path Switch procedure, i.e. steps 1 to 8 of clause 4.9.1.2.2 and including Xn data forwarding.\nIf the Connection Resume procedure is a response to RAN paging which is triggered by 5GC due to an N2 interface procedure, NG-RAN and 5GC handle the N2 interface procedure as a collision described in clause 4.9.1.2.\nIf Connection Inactive procedure with CN based MT communication handling (see clause 4.8.1.1a) has been performed previously then when the path switch procedure is performed downlink data or signalling delivery is triggered, if there is any.\nIf NG-RAN supports PDU Set based handling, then NG-RAN includes PDU Set Based Handling Support Indication in N2 Path Switch request message as described in clause 5.37.5.3 of TS 23.501 [2]. With the indication, the SMF may determine to activate PDU Set based Handling as described in clause 5.37.5.3 of TS 23.501 [2].\n4b.\t[Conditional] N2 Notification:\n4b.1\tIf the accessed NG-RAN is the same as the NG-RAN that configured RRC_INACTIVE and still has the UE context, NG-RAN sends:\n-\tan N2 Notification to the AMF indicating the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED, if an AMF requested N2 Notification (see clause 4.8.3); or\n-\tan MT Communication Handling request to the AMF indicating the UE is now reachable for downlink data and/or signalling if Connection Inactive procedure with CN based MT communication handling (see clause 4.8.1.1a) has been performed previously. The NG-RAN also provides the List of PDU sessions with active user plane resource.\n4b.2\tThe AMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request towards SMF indicating the Downlink data delivery for each PDU session with active user plane as indicated by NG-RAN in step 4b.1, if the AMF has requested data buffering as described in clause 4.8.1.1a.\n4b.3\tN4 session modification procedure is triggered by the SMF. If data buffering is handled in the UPF, the SMF updates the UPF with appropriate rules to trigger data delivery.\n4b.4\tThe SMF sends the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext response.\n4b.5\tThe AMF sends the N2 MT Communication Handling response message to NG-RAN.\nIf NG-RAN determines that the connection resume is for Small Data Transmission as defined in TS 38.300 [9] and step 4a or steps 4b.1 to 4b.5 have been performed, then NG-RAN keeps the UE in RRC_INACTIVE state and the UL/DL Small Data are transferred via the NG-RAN. Based on the procedures defined in TS 38.300 [9], if the UE is re-configured with RRC Inactive with eDRX>10.24s, the NG-RAN may send an N2 message to 5GC as described in step 2 in clause 4.8.1.1a so the CN can then handle mobile terminated (MT) communication.\n4.8.2.2a\tNetwork Triggered Connection Resume in RRC_INACTIVE procedure\nThe Network Triggered Connection Resume in RRC_INACTIVE procedure is used when the NG-RAN needs to send data (e.g. the N1 NAS PDU and/or downlink user plane PDU) to a UE in the RRC_INACTIVE state. During the procedure, the NG-RAN sends a RAN Paging to the UE in order to trigger the Connection Resume in RRC_INACTIVE procedure in clause 4.8.2.2.\nFigure 4.8.2.2a-1: Network Triggered Connection Resume for UE in RRC_INACTIVE\n1.\tThe NG-RAN receives downlink data (e.g. the N1 NAS PDU and/or the user plane PDU) for a UE in RRC_INACTIVE State, the NG-RAN buffers the downlink data and triggers RAN Paging message.\nIf the NG RAN supports the Paging Cause Indication for Voice Service feature and if the UE context in NG-RAN indicates that the UE supports the Paging Cause Indication for Voice Service feature, the NG RAN shall provide the Voice Service Indication in the RAN Paging message for the UE when it detects that the downlink data which triggers the RAN Paging message is related to voice service, as specified in clause 5.38.3 of TS 23.501 [2].\n2.\tThe NG-RAN sends the RAN Paging message to the UE.\n3.\tIf the UE is in RRC_INACTIVE State, based on the RAN paging and the UE decides to accept the paging, the UE initiates the UE Triggered Connection Resume in RRC_INACTIVE procedure (see clause 4.8.2.2).\n4.8.2.2b\tNetwork Triggered Connection Resume in RRC_INACTIVE with CN based MT communication handling\nWhen the UE is in CM-CONNECTED with RRC_INACTIVE state with CN based mobile terminating (MT) communication handling, high latency communication as described in clause 5.31.8 of TS 23.501 [2] is applied.\nThis procedure may be triggered by MT data, or a N1 procedure from SMF and UPF as shown in Figure 4.8.2.2b-1. When the procedure is triggered by other NFs (e.g. SMSF, LMF, GMLC), the UPF (or SMF) in the following figure should be replaced by the respective NF (the corresponding service operations used by other NFs when they communicate with AMF may also be different from the service operations used by SMF/UPF). For MT-SMS delivery request from SMSF, see also procedures defined in clause 4.13.3.6, clause 4.13.3.7 and clause 4.13.3.8.\nDuring the procedure, the NG-RAN (i.e. gNB) performs RAN paging towards the UE based on the N2 message from the AMF in order to trigger the UE triggered Connection Resume procedure in clause 4.8.2.2.\nFigure 4.8.2.2b-1: Network Triggered Connection Resume for UE in RRC_INACTIVE with CN based MT communication handling\n1a.\tWhen downlink data is received and the SMF/UPF is requested to perform buffering as specified in clause 4.8.1.1a, the UPF/SMF checks with AMF for the possibility of data delivery, similar to step 2 of clause 4.24.2 with the following differences:\n-\tThe UPF provides the DL data size information of the QoS Flow when sending Data Notification to SMF if the UPF has received instruction from SMF.\nNOTE 1:\tThe DL data size corresponds to the cumulative size of all the buffered packets in the UPF at the time when the UPF triggers the Data Notification. This is typically the size of the first DL packet, unless multiple DL packets arrive in a single burst before the UPF triggers the Data Notification.\n-\tIn the Namf_MT_EnableUEReachability the SMF may also send the following parameters the PPI, the ARP and the 5QI, DL data size and/or QFI for the QoS Flow of the PDU Session which triggered the request for paging policy differentiation as defined in clause 5.4.3.2 of TS 23.501 [2].\n-\tThe AMF determines if the UE is reachable based on the stored eDRX values for RRC_INACTIVE state provided by NG-RAN in clause 4.8.1.1a. If the UE is unreachable, the AMF stores the information received in the Namf_MT_EnableUEReachability request and provides the Estimated Maximum Wait time in the reject response message based on the eDRX values for RRC_INACTIVE in AMF (steps 2-5 are postponed until the UE becomes reachable). If the UE is considered reachable, step 2 is executed immediately.\nNOTE 2:\tThis handling is similar to CM-IDLE with eDRX. When the AMF provides the Estimated Maximum Wait time, it can consider the time needed for RRC level procedures (e.g. RRC RNA update procedure) when UE wakes up from the eDRX cycle.\nNOTE 3:\tThe other NFs can use the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation to deliver the MT signalling.\nIf the SMF, after the reception of reject response in step 1.a.3 and while waiting for UE triggered Connection Resume indication (within the Estimated Maximum Wait time) from the AMF, receives any additional Data Notification message due to additional data packets for another QoS Flow associated with a higher priority (i.e. ARP priority level) than the priority indicated to the AMF in the previous Namf_MT_EnableUEReachability, or the SMF derive a different Paging Policy Indicator according to the additional Data Notification, the SMF invokes a new Namf_MT_EnableUEReachability indicating the higher priority or different Paging Policy Indicator to the AMF. The information contained in the new Namf_MT_EnableUEReachability request may override the information from the previous Namf_MT_EnableUEReachability request that is stored in the AMF based on local configuration. If the SMF receives any additional Data Notification messages due to additional data packets for another QoS Flow associated with same or lower priority than the priority indicated to the AMF in the previous Namf_MT_EnableUEReachability or if the SMF has sent the second Namf_MT_EnableUEReachability message indicating the higher priority, based on local configuration, the SMF either buffers these Data Notification messages and does not send a new Namf_MT_EnableUEReachability message, or the SMF sends a new Namf_MT_EnableUEReachability message to AMF. If AMF receives DL data sizes for different QoS Flows from SMF, based on local configuration, the AMF may store the DL data size information for each QoS Flows and provides the information per QoS Flow to NG-RAN as in step 2 below.\n2.\tWhen the AMF determines that the UE is reachable, the AMF sends a RAN Paging Request message to NG-RAN with the request for the UE's RRC connection to be resumed. The AMF may include the following parameters in the RAN Paging Request message to trigger and enable RAN paging:\n-\tOn per QoS Flow basis the PPI, the ARP, DL data size, the 5QI and/or QFI for the QoS Flow(s) of the PDU Session; and/or\nA DL Signalling indication if the AMF receives MT signalling (i.e. via Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer) in step 1a.\n3.\tNG-RAN performs RAN paging towards the UE considering the parameters provided by the AMF. Based on the QFI and/or the DL data size for QoS Flow(s), if provided, the NG-RAN determines whether to set the MT-SDT indication as defined in TS 38.300 [9]).\n4.\tWhen the UE receives RAN paging, it initiates the UE triggered Connection Resume procedure and NG-RAN notifies CN as specified in clause 4.8.2.2 including the N2 Notification in step 3b. If the Namf_MT_EnableUEReachability response was not sent in step 1.a.3 (i.e. the AMF has considered the UE is reachable in step 1), then the AMF sends the Namf_MT_EnableUEReachability response to the SMF along with step 4 of the UE triggered Connection Resume in RRC_INACTIVE procedure (see clause 4.8.2.2).\n5.\tThe UPF triggers downlink data delivery if there is any. The AMF sends downlink NAS messages if there is any.",

The Operation Type is set to \"UP Resume\" to indicate resume of user plane resources for the PDU Session.\nFor PDU Session(s) to be switched to the new NG-RAN, upon receipt of the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext request, the SMF determines whether the existing UPF can continue to serve the UE. If the existing UPF cannot continue to serve the UE, steps 3 to 7 of clause 4.9.1.2.3 or clause 4.9.1.2.4 are performed depending on whether the existing UPF is a PDU Session Anchor and flow continues in step 7. Otherwise, step 6 is performed if the existing UPF can continue to serve the PDU Session.\nIf the RRC connection is resumed and the UE is accessing via the NB-IoT RAT with the RRC resume cause set to \"MO exception data\" the AMF updates all (H-)SMFs. If AMF indicates \"MO exception data\" then it includes the MO Exception Data Counter. The AMF maintains the MO Exception Data Counter for Small Data Rate Control purposes as described in clause 5.31.14.3 of TS 23.501 [2]. Each (H-)SMF should be updated for every RRC Connection which is triggered for \"MO exception data\".\nIn the home-routed roaming case, if Small Data Rate Control applies, the V-SMF waits for H-SMF response before proceeding with the N3 establishment.\n6.\tSMF to UPF: N4 Session Modification Request (AN Tunnel Info to be resumed, Buffering on/off).\nThe SMF initiates an N4 Session Modification procedure indicating the resume of AN tunnel.

Any NF (e.g. the SMF) should hold any signalling messages targeted towards AMF for a given UE during the handover preparation phase unless it detects that the handover execution is completed or handover has failed/cancelled. The NF (e.g. the SMF) may re-attempt, up to a pre-configured number of times, when either it detects that the handover is completed or has failed using message reception or at expiry of the guard timer.\nFor the MBSR mobility as specified in clause 5.35A.3 of TS 23.501 [2], the MBSR-UE may operate without any PDU session. In that case, the NG-RAN and the AMF behave as specified in clause 5.35A.3.4 of TS 23.501 [2].",

      "content": "This procedure is used to hand over a UE from a source NG-RAN to Target NG-RAN using Xn when the AMF is unchanged and the SMF decides to keep the existing UPF. The UPF referred in this clause 4.9.1.2.2 is the UPF which terminates N3 interface in the 5GC for non-roaming or local breakout roaming scenario, V-UPF which terminates N3 interface in 5GC for home routed roaming scenario. The SMF referred in this clause 4.9.1.2.2 is the V-SMF for home routed roaming scenario. The presence of IP connectivity between the Source UPF and Target NG-RAN is assumed.\nThe call flow is shown in figure 4.9.1.2.2-1.\nFigure 4.9.1.2.2-1: Xn based inter NG-RAN handover without UPF re-allocation\n1a.\tIf the PLMN has configured secondary RAT usage reporting, the source NG-RAN node during the handover execution phase may provide RAN usage data Report (N2 SM Information (Secondary RAT usage data), Handover Flag, Source to Target transparent container) to the AMF. The source NG-RAN node shall provide this only when the Target NG-RAN has confirmed handover over Xn interface. The Handover Flag indicates to the AMF that it should buffer the N2 SM Information containing the usage data report before forwarding it.\nIf the source NG RAN and Target NG RAN support RACS as defined in TS 23.501 [2], the source NG-RAN provides the UE's UE Radio Capability ID to the Target NG-RAN. If the source NG-RAN has knowledge that the Target NG-RAN might not have a local copy of the Radio Capability corresponding to the UE Radio Capability ID (i.e. because the source NG-RAN had itself to retrieve the UE's Radio Capability from the AMF) then the source NG-RAN may also send some or all of the UE's Radio Capability to the Target NG-RAN (the size limit based on local configuration) in Xn signalling as defined in TS 38.423 [72] . In the case of inter-PLMN handover, when the source and Target NG-RAN support RACS as defined in TS 23.501 [2] and the source NG-RAN determines based on local configuration that the Target PLMN does not support the UE Radio Capability ID assigned by the source PLMN, then the source NG-RAN shall provide the UE radio access capabilities to the Target NG-RAN and shall not send the UE Radio Capability ID. If, as permitted in TS 38.423 [72], the Target NG-RAN during the handover preparation received the UE radio access capabilities but did not receive the UE Radio Capability ID, NG-RAN shall proceed with handover using the received UE radio access capabilities. If the Target NG-RAN received both the UE radio access capabilities and the UE Radio Capability ID, then the Target NG-RAN shall use any locally stored UE radio access capability information corresponding to the UE Radio Capability ID. If none are stored locally, the Target NG-RAN may request the full UE radio access capability information from the core network. If the full UE radio access capability information is not promptly received from the core network, or the Target NG-RAN chooses not to request them, then the Target NG-RAN shall proceed with the UE radio access capabilities sent by the source NG-RAN. The Target NG-RAN shall not use the UE radio access capability information received from the source NG-RAN for any other UE with the same the UE Radio Capability ID.\n1b.\tTarget NG-RAN to AMF: N2 Path Switch Request (List of PDU Sessions To Be Switched with N2 SM Information, List of PDU Sessions that failed to be established with the failure cause given in the N2 SM information element, UE Location Information, established QoS Flows status (active/not active) (for one of the following: congestion information monitoring, ECN marking for L4S at PSA UPF ECN marking for L4S at NG-RAN), PDU Set Based Handling Support Indication included in the N2 SM information).\nThe Target NG-RAN sends an N2 Path Switch Request message to an AMF to inform that the UE has moved to a new Target cell and provides a List Of PDU Sessions To Be Switched. AN Tunnel Info for each PDU Session to be switched is included in the N2 SM Information.\nIf redundant transmission is performed for one or more QoS Flows in the PDU Session, two AN Tunnel Info are provided by the Target NG-RAN and the Target NG-RAN indicates to the SMF one of the AN Tunnel Info is used as the redundancy tunnel of the PDU Session as described in clause 5.33.2.2 of TS 23.501 [2]. If only one AN Tunnel Info is provided by the Target NG-RAN for the PDU session, the SMF may release these QoS Flows by triggering PDU Session Modification procedure as specified in clause 4.3.3 after the handover procedure.\nThe serving PLMN ID is included in the message. The Target NG-RAN shall include the PDU Session in the PDU Sessions Rejected list:\n-\tIf none of the QoS Flows of a PDU Session are accepted by the Target NG-RAN; or\n-\tIf the corresponding network slice is not supported in the Target NG-RAN; or\n-\tWhen the NG-RAN cannot set up user plane resources fulfilling the User Plane Security Enforcement with a value Required, the NG-RAN rejects the establishment of user plane resources for the PDU Session.\nIf the NG-RAN cannot set up user plane resources fulfilling the User Plane Security Enforcement with a value Preferred, the NG-RAN establishes the user plane resources for the PDU session and shall include the PDU Session in the PDU Sessions Modified list.\nPDU Sessions Rejected contains an indication of whether the PDU session was rejected because User Plane Security Enforcement is not supported in the Target NG-RAN. Depending on the type of target cell, the Target NG-RAN includes appropriate information in this message.\nFor the PDU Sessions to be switched to the Target NG-RAN, the N2 Path Switch Request message shall include the list of accepted QoS Flows. For each QoS Flow accepted with an Alternative QoS Profile as specified in TS 23.501 [2], the N2 SM Information shall include a reference to the fulfilled Alternative QoS Profile.\nThe NG-RAN includes the PDU Set Based Handling Support Indication in N2 SM information as defined in clause 5.37.5.3 of TS 23.501 [2].\n2.\tAMF to SMF: Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request (N2 SM information received from T-RAN in step 1b and N2 SM Information from source NG-RAN (Secondary RAT usage data), UE Location Information, UE presence in LADN service area). The N2 SM Information here from source NG-RAN is the one buffered at step 1a when applicable.\nThe AMF sends N2 SM information by invoking the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext request service operation for each PDU Session in the lists of PDU Sessions received in the N2 Path Switch Request.\nThe Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request contains either an indication that the PDU Session Is To Be Switched (together with information on the N3 addressing to use and on the transferred QoS flows) or an indication that the PDU Session is to be Rejected (together with a rejection cause).\nIf the AMF, based on configuration, as described in clause 5.43.4 of TS 23.501 [2], is aware that satellite backhaul category has changed due to the handover and needs to be updated to the SMF, the AMF includes the new Satellite backhaul category as described in clause 5.43.4 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf the AMF, based on configuration, as described in clause 5.43.2 of TS 23.501 [2], is aware that the UE is accessing over a gNB using GEO satellite backhaul and GEO Satellite ID needs to be updated to the SMF, the AMF may include the latest GEO Satellite ID as described in clause 5.43.2 of TS 23.501 [2].\nFor a PDU Sessions to be switched to the Target NG-RAN, upon receipt of the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext request, the SMF determines whether the existing UPF can continue to serve the UE. If the existing UPF cannot continue to serve the UE, steps 3-11 of clause 4.9.1.2.3 or 4.9.1.2.4 are performed depending on whether the existing UPF is a PDU Session Anchor. Otherwise, the following steps 3 to 6 are performed if the existing UPFs can continue to serve the PDU Session.\nIn the case that the AMF determines that the PDU Session is related to a LADN, then the AMF provides the \"UE presence in LADN service area\" to the SMF. If the AMF does not provide the \"UE presence in LADN service area\" indication and the SMF determines that the DNN corresponds to a LADN, then the SMF considers that the UE is OUT of the LADN service area. The SMF takes actions for the LADN PDU Session as defined in clause 5.6.5 of TS 23.501 [2] based on the \"UE presence in LADN service area\" indication.\nIf a PDU Session is rejected by the Target NG-RAN with an indication that the PDU session was rejected because User Plane Security Enforcement is not supported in the Target NG-RAN and the User Plane Enforcement Policy indicates \"Required\" as described in clause 5.10.3 of TS 23.501 [2], the SMF triggers the release of this PDU Session. In all other cases of PDU Session rejection, the SMF can decide whether to release the PDU Session or to deactivate the UP connection of this PDU Session.\nIf some of the QoS Flows of a PDU Session are not accepted by the Target NG-RAN, the SMF shall initiate the PDU Session Modification procedure to remove the non-accepted QoS Flows from the PDU Session(s) after the handover procedure is completed.\nFor the PDU Session(s) that do not have active N3 UP connections before handover procedure, the SMF(s) keep the inactive status after handover procedure.\nIf the UE moves into a non-Allowed Area, the AMF also notifies via Namf_EventExposure_Notify to each NF Consumer (e.g. SMFs of the established PDU Sessions) which has subscribed for UE reachability event, that the UE is only reachable for regulatory prioritized services. The SMF then deactivates the PDU session if this PDU Session is not for emergency service.\n3.\tSMF to UPF: N4 Session Modification Request (AN Tunnel Info)\nFor PDU Sessions that are modified by the Target NG-RAN, the SMF sends an N4 Session Modification Request message to the UPF. The SMF may notify the UPF that originated the Data Notification to discard downlink data for the PDU Sessions and/or to not provide further Data Notification messages.\nDepending on the network deployment, the CN Tunnel Info of UPF used for connection to Target NG-RAN and connection to Source NG-RAN may be different, e.g. due to Source and Target NG-RAN are in different IP domains. In this case the SMF may ask the UPF to allocate new CN Tunnel Info, providing the target Network Instance.\n4.\tUPF to SMF: N4 Session Modification Response (CN Tunnel Info)\nFor the PDU Sessions that are switched, the UPF returns an N4 Session Modification Response message to the SMF after requested PDU Sessions are switched. Tunnel identifiers for UL traffic are included only for PDU Sessions whose user plane resources are not being released and was requested by the SMF. If redundant transmission is performed for one or more QoS Flows of a PDU Session and different CN Tunnel Info were requested by the SMF, the UPF allocates two different CN Tunnel Info and indicates the SMF that one CN Tunnel Info is used as the redundancy tunnel of the PDU session as described in clause 5.33.2.2 of TS 23.501 [2]. For the PDU Sessions that are deactivated, the UPF returns an N4 Session Modification Response message to the SMF after the N3 (R)AN tunnel information is released.\n5.\tIn order to assist the reordering function in the Target NG-RAN, the UPF (as specified in clause 5.8.2.9 of TS 23.501 [2]) sends one or more \"end marker\" packets for each N3 tunnel on the old path immediately after switching the path. The UPF starts sending downlink packets to the Target NG-RAN.\n6.\tSMF to AMF: Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response (N2 SM information)\nThe SMF sends an Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext response (N2 SM Information (CN Tunnel Info, updated CN PDB for the accepted QoS Flows, Updated TSCAIs for the accepted QoS Flows)) to the AMF for PDU Sessions which have been switched successfully. The CN Tunnel Info of UPF send to AMF is used to setup N3 tunnel. If redundant transmission is performed for one or more QoS Flows of a PDU Session, two CN Tunnel Info are sent and the SMF indicates to the Target NG-RAN one of the CN Tunnel Info is used as the redundancy tunnel of the PDU Session as described in clause 5.33.2.2 of TS 23.501 [2]. The SMF sends an Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext response without including the CN Tunnel Info to the AMF for the PDU Sessions for which user plane resources are deactivated or released and then the SMF releases the PDU Session(s) which is to be released using a separate procedure as defined in clause 4.3.4. For each accepted GBR QoS Flow of Delay-critical resource type, the dynamic CN PDB and TSCAI may be updated and sent to the Target NG-RAN by the SMF. The SMF may update the CN PDB and TSCAI in the response or using a separate PDU Session Modification procedure, based on local configuration.\nIf the Source NG-RAN does not support Alternative QoS Profiles (see TS 23.501 [2]) and the Target NG-RAN supports them, the SMF sends the Alternative QoS Profiles (see TS 23.501 [2]) to the Target NG-RAN on a per QoS Flow basis, if available.\nNOTE:\tStep 6 can occur any time after receipt of N4 Session Modification Response at the SMF.\n7.\tAMF to NG-RAN: N2 Path Switch Request Ack (N2 SM Information, Failed PDU Sessions, UE Radio Capability ID).\nOnce the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext response is received from all the SMFs, the AMF aggregates received CN Tunnel Info and sends this aggregated information as a part of N2 SM Information along with the Failed PDU Sessions in N2 Path Switch Request Ack to the Target NG-RAN. If none of the requested PDU Sessions have been switched successfully, the AMF shall send an N2 Path Switch Request Failure message to the Target NG-RAN.\nIf the UE Radio Capability ID is included in the N2 Path Switch Request Ack message, when there is no corresponding UE radio capabilities set for UE Radio Capability ID at the Target NR-RAN, the Target NG-RAN shall request the AMF to provide the UE radio capabilities set corresponding to UE Radio Capability ID to the Target NG-RAN.\n8.\tBy sending a Release Resources message to the Source NG-RAN, the Target NG-RAN confirms success of the handover. It then triggers the release of resources with the Source NG-RAN.\n9.\t[Conditional] The UE may initiate Mobility Registration Update procedure if one of the triggers of registration procedure applies as described in clause 4.2.2.2.2. In this case, only steps 1, 2, 3, 17 and 21 in clause 4.2.2.2.2 are performed.\nFor the mobility related events as described in clause 4.15.4, the AMF invokes the Namf_EventExposure_Notify service operation.\nUpon reception of the Namf_EventExposure_Notify with an indication that UE is reachable only for regulatory prioritized service, the SMF deactivates the PDU Session if the service of the PDU Session is not regulatory prioritized. For home routed roaming case, the V-SMF triggers the deactivation of the PDU Session, in addition, the H-SMF refrains from sending downlink signalling if the signalling is not related to regulatory prioritized service upon receiving the notification.",

The SMFs use the indication from the source NG-RAN to determine whether to apply indirect forwarding.\nIf both source NG-RAN and source AMF support DAPS the source NG-RAN may decide that some of the DRBs are subject for DAPS handover as defined in TS 38.300 [9]; in this case, the source NG-RAN provides the DAPS information indicating the request concerns a DAPS handover for the DRB as part of the Source to Target (NG-RAN) Transparent Container. If the target NG-RAN accepts that the request concerns DAPS handover and both Target NG-RAN and Target AMF support DAPS, the DAPS handover will be performed and target NG-RAN provides DAPS response information as part of the Target to Source (NG-RAN) Transparent Container.\nIn the case of handover to a shared network, the source NG-RAN determines a PLMN (or PLMN ID and NID, see clause 5.30 of TS 23.501 [2]) to be used in the target network as specified by TS 23.501 [2]. The source NG-RAN shall indicate the selected PLMN ID to be used in the target network to the AMF as part of the Tracking Area sent, or the selected SNPN ID to be used in the target network to the AMF, in the HO Required message.\nIf the AMF generates the N2 downlink signalling during the ongoing handover and receives a rejection to a N2 interface procedure (e.g. DL NAS message transfer; Location reporting control; etc.) from the NG-RAN with an indication that an Inter NG-RAN node handover procedure is in progress, the AMF may reattempt the same N2 interface procedure either when the handover is complete or the handover is deemed to have failed if the AMF is still the serving AMF, when possible. If the Inter NG-RAN node handover changes the serving AMF, the source AMF shall terminate any other ongoing N2 interface procedures except the handover procedure.\nIn order to minimize the number of procedures rejected by NG-RAN, the AMF should pause non-handover related N2 interface procedures (e.g. DL NAS message transfer, Location Report Control, etc.) while a handover is ongoing (i.e. from the time that a Handover Required has been received until either the Handover procedure has succeeded (Handover Notify) or failed (Handover Failure)) and continue them once the Handover procedure has completed if the AMF is still the serving AMF.\nIf during the handover procedure the AMF detects that the AMF needs be changed, the AMF shall reject any SMF initiated N2 request received since handover procedure started and shall include an indication that the request has been temporarily rejected due to handover procedure in progress.\nUpon reception for an SMF initiated N1 and/or N2 request(s) with an indication either from the NG-RAN (via N2 SM Info) or AMF that the request has been temporarily rejected due to handover procedure in progress, the SMF starts a locally configured guard timer. The SMF should hold any signalling messages targeted towards AMF for a given UE during the handover preparation phase unless it detects that the handover execution is completed or handover has failed/cancelled. The SMF may re-attempt, up to a pre-configured number of times, when either it detects that the handover is completed or has failed using message reception or at expiry of the guard timer.\nIn the case of N2 handover within the VPLMN in a home routed roaming scenario, the SMF in the Inter NG-RAN node N2 based handover procedure (Figure 4.9.1.3.2-1 and Figure 4.9.1.3.3-1) interacting with the S-UPF, T-UPF, S-AMF and T-AMF is the V-SMF and the SMF (Figure 4.9.1.3.3-1) interacting with the UPF (PSA) is the H-SMF.\nIn the case of inter-PLMN N2 handover in a home routed roaming scenario, the procedures in clause 4.23 apply.\nFor the MBSR mobility as specified in clause 5.35A.3 of TS 23.501 [2], the MBSR-UE may operate without any PDU session. In that case, the NG-RAN and the AMF behave as specified in clause 5.35A.3.4 in TS 23.501 [2].",

The T-AMF, ensures that the selected NID is forwarded to SMF.\nSource to Target transparent container includes NG-RAN information created by S-RAN to be used by T-RAN and is transparent to 5GC. It also contains for each PDU session the corresponding QoS flows/DRBs information subject to data forwarding. It may also contain DAPS Information if DAPS handover is supported by S-RAN and S-AMF and DAPS handover is requested for one or more DRBs as described in TS 38.300 [9]. It may also contain the time-based handover parameters when time-based trigger condition is used.\nAll PDU Sessions handled by S-RAN (i.e. all existing PDU Sessions with active UP connections) shall be included in the Handover Required message, indicating which of those PDU Session(s) are requested by S-RAN to handover. The SM N2 info includes Direct Forwarding Path Availability if direct data forwarding is available.\nDirect Forwarding Path Availability indicates whether direct forwarding is available from the S-RAN to the T-RAN. This indication from S-RAN can be based on e.g. the presence of IP connectivity and security association(s) between the S-RAN and the T-RAN.\nIf the source NG RAN and target NG RAN support RACS as defined in TS 23.501 [2], the Source to Target transparent container need not carry the UE radio access capabilities (instead the UE Radio Capability ID is supplied from the CN to the T-RAN). However, if the source NG-RAN has knowledge that the target NG-RAN might not have a local copy of the Radio Capability corresponding to the UE Radio Capability ID (i.e. because the source NG-RAN had itself to retrieve the UE's Radio Capability from the AMF) then the source NG-RAN may also send some (or all) of the UE's Radio Capability to the target NG-RAN (the size limit based on local configuration). In the case of inter-PLMN handover, when the source and target NG-RAN support RACS as defined in TS 23.501 [2] and the source NG-RAN determines based on local configuration that the target PLMN does not support the UE Radio Capability ID assigned by the source PLMN, then the source NG-RAN includes the UE radio access capabilities in the Source to Target transparent container.\n2.\tT-AMF Selection: When the S-AMF can't serve the UE anymore, the S-AMF selects the T-AMF as described in clause 6.3.5 on \"AMF Selection Function\" in TS 23.501 [2].\n3.\t[Conditional] S-AMF to T-AMF: Namf_Communication_CreateUEContext Request (N2 Information (Target ID, Source to Target transparent container, SM N2 information list, PDU Session IDs), UE context information (SUPI, Service area restriction, Allowed NSSAI for each Access Type and Partially Allowed NSSAI if available, Tracing Requirements, LTE M Indication, the list of PDU Session IDs along with the corresponding SMF information and the corresponding S-NSSAI(s), PCF ID(s), DNN, UE Radio Capability ID and UE Radio Capability Information, N2 Notify URI). If the subscription information includes Tracing Requirements, the old AMF provides the target AMF with Tracing Requirements.\nIf the old AMF was a consumer of UE related NWDAF services, the old AMF includes information about active analytics subscriptions, i.e. the Subscription Correlation ID(s), NWDAF identifier(s) (i.e. Instance ID or Set ID), Analytics ID(s) and associated Analytics specific data in the Namf_Communication_UEContextTransfer request. Usage of the analytics information by the new AMF is specified in TS 23.288 [50].\nIn inter PLMN handover case, UE context information includes HPLMN S-NSSAIs corresponding to the Allowed NSSAI for each Access Type and Partially Allowed NSSAI, without Allowed NSSAI and Partially Allowed NSSAI of source PLMN. The target AMF may determine the Allowed NSSAI and Partially Allowed NSSAI based on the HPLMN S-NSSAIs received in step 3, or else the target AMF queries the NSSF by invoking Nnssf_NSSelection_Get service operation with the HPLMN S-NSSAIs and PLMN ID of SUPI. Based on the query result returned from the NSSF, the target AMF determines whether the AMF re-allocation need be triggered and if needed reselects another target AMF. In this case the target AMF selected by the S-AMF is the Initial AMF. And another reselected target AMF is the final target AMF (i.e. T-AMF).\nThe S-AMF initiates Handover resource allocation procedure by invoking the Namf_Communication_CreateUEContext service operation towards the target AMF.\nWhen the S-AMF can still serve the UE, this step and step 12 are not needed.\nIf target AMF re-allocation is needed, e.g. due to the inter PLMN handover, the initial AMF invokes Namf_Communication_CreateUEContext request (SUPI, Target 5GAN Node ID, Source to Target Transparent Container, 5GS MM Context, PDU Session ID and its associated S-NSSAI of the VPLMN value for each PDU Session, the corresponding S-NSSAI of HPLMN value for home routed PDU Session(s), Allowed NSSAI, N2 Notify URI) to the selected final target AMF. The N2 Notify URI is the N2 Notify URI of the source AMF, which is used by the T-AMF to send N2 handover notify to the S-AMF. If the information about active analytics subscriptions are received from S-AMF, it is also included them in the Namf_Communication_CreateUEContext request.\nIf Service area restrictions are available in the S-AMF, they may be forwarded to the T-AMF as described in clause 5.3.4.1.2 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf both Home and Visited PCF ID(s) are provided by the S-AMF, the T-AMF contacts the (V-) PCF identified by the (V-)PCF ID. If the (V-)PCF identified by the (V-)PCF ID is not used or there are no PCF ID(s) received from the S-AMF, the T-AMF may select the PCF(s) as described in clause 6.3.7.1 of TS 23.501 [2] and according to the V-NRF to H-NRF interaction described in clause 4.3.2.2.3.3. The T-AMF informs the S-AMF that the PCF ID is not used, as defined in step 12 and then the S-AMF terminates the AM Policy Association with the PCF identified by the PCF ID.\n4.\t[Conditional] T-AMF to SMF: Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext (PDU Session ID, Target ID, T-AMF ID, N2 SM Information).\nFor each PDU Session indicated by S-RAN, the AMF invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request to the associated SMF. However, if the S-NSSAI associated with PDU Session is not available in the T-AMF, the T-AMF does not invoke Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext for this PDU Session.\nPDU Session ID indicates a PDU Session candidate for N2 Handover. Target ID corresponds to Target ID provided by S-RAN in step 1. SM N2 Info includes the Direct Forwarding Path Availability if the direct data forwarding is available between the S-RAN and the T-RAN and has been inserted by the S-RAN.\nIf the (T-)AMF detects that the UE moves into a non-allowed area based on Service area restrictions, the (T‑)AMF notifies each NF consumer which has subscribed for UE reachability event (e.g. SMFs corresponding to the list of PDU Sessions received in UE Context from (S-)AMF via Namf_EventExposure_Notify that the UE is only reachable for regulatory prioritized services.\n5.\t[Conditional] SMF checks if the Target ID is within the service area of the UPF connecting to NG-RAN. If UE has moved out of the service area of the UPF connecting to NG-RAN, SMF selects a new intermediate UPF according to clause 6.3.3 of TS 23.501 [2], if available. If redundant transmission is performed for one or more QoS Flows of the PDU Session, the SMF selects two new Intermediate UPFs to support the redundant transmission based on two N3 and N9 tunnels between the T-RAN and the UPF (PSA) as described in clause 5.33.2.2 of TS 23.501 [2]. In this case, step 6c and 6d are performed between SMF and each T-UPF.\n6a.\t[Conditional] SMF to UPF (PSA): N4 Session Modification Request.\nIf the SMF selects a new UPF to act as intermediate UPF for the PDU Session and the different CN Tunnel Info need be used, the SMF sends N4 Session Modification Request message to UPF (PSA). The SMF provides the CN Tunnel Info (on N9) if the CN Tunnel Info is allocated by the SMF and UL Packet detection rules associate the CN Tunnel Info (on N9) to be installed on the UPF (PSA).\nIf redundant transmission is performed for one or more QoS Flows of the PDU Session and the different CN Tunnel Info need be used, the SMF provides two CN Tunnel Info (on N9) to the UPF (PSA) if the CN Tunnel Info is allocated by the SMF and indicates to the UPF (PSA) one of the CN Tunnel Info is used as redundancy tunnel of the PDU Session.\n6b.\t[Conditional] UPF (PSA) to SMF: N4 Session Modification Response.\nThe UPF (PSA) sends an N4 Session Modification Response message to the SMF. If the UPF (PSA) allocates CN Tunnel Info (on N9) of UPF (PSA), it provides CN Tunnel Info (on N9) to the SMF. If redundant transmission is performed for one or more QoS Flows of the PDU Session, the UPF (PSA) provides two CN Tunnel Info (on N9) of UPF (PSA) to the SMF and indicates the SMF that one CN Tunnel Info is used as redundancy tunnel of the PDU Session as described in in clause 5.33.2.2 of TS 23.501 [2]. The UPF (PSA) associate the CN Tunnel Info (on N9) with UL Packet detection rules provided by the SMF.\n6c.\t[Conditional] SMF to T-UPF (intermediate): N4 Session Establishment Request.\nIf the SMF selects a new intermediate UPF, i.e. the target UPF (T-UPF), for the PDU Session and if CN Tunnel Info is allocated by the T-UPF, an N4 Session Establishment Request message is sent to the T-UPF, providing Packet detection, enforcement and reporting rules to be installed on the T-UPF. The CN Tunnel Info (on N9) of UPF (PSA) for this PDU Session, which is used to setup N9 tunnel, is also provided to the T-UPF.\n6d.\tT-UPF (intermediate) to SMF: N4 Session Establishment Response.\nThe T-UPF sends an N4 Session Establishment Response message to the SMF with DL CN Tunnel Info and UL CN Tunnel Info (i.e. N3 tunnel info). The SMF starts a timer to release the resource of S-UPF, which is to be used in step 13a of the Execution Phase.\n7.\tSMF to T-AMF: Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response (PDU Session ID, N2 SM Information, Reason for non-acceptance).\nIf at step 5 the SMF has determined that the UPF connecting to NG-RAN can still be used after the handover or has selected a new intermediate UPF, the SMF includes in the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext response the N2 SM Information containing the N3 UP address and the UL CN Tunnel ID of the UPF, the QoS parameters, TSCAI and the User Plane Security Enforcement information for the Target NG-RAN. If redundant transmission is performed for one or more QoS Flows of the PDU Session, two UL CN Tunnel Info are included in the N2 SM Information. If the N2 SM information received at step 4 does not include the Direct Forwarding Path Availability and the SMF knows that there is no indirect data forwarding connectivity between source and target, the N2 SM Information includes a Data forwarding not possible indication. If the SMF indicated that Direct Forwarding is available in step 4, the SMF should further include a \"Direct Forwarding Path Availability\" indication in the N2 SM information container. The SMF sends the Alternative QoS Profiles, request for congestion information monitoring or request for information for ECN marking for L4S at PSA UPF or request for ECN marking for L4S at NG-RAN for QoS Flow (see clauses 5.45.3, 5.37.4 and 5.37.3 of TS 23.501 [2]) to the Target NG-RAN on a per QoS Flow basis, if available.\nIf the SMF failed to find a suitable I-UPF at step 5, the SMF does not include any N2 SM Information regarding the PDU Session to avoid establishment of radio resources at the target NG-RAN. Instead of that, the SMF provides a reason for non-acceptance. The SMF decides to (based on local policies) either:\n-\ttrigger re-establishment of PDU Session. After handover procedure, SMF sends N1 message to the UE via the AMF by invoking Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer containing the cause indicating PDU Session re-establishment is required for the UE; or\n-\tkeep the PDU Session (the User Plane connection being deactivated); or\n-\trelease the PDU Session after handover procedure.\nIf the SMF has received notification from (T-)AMF that the UE is only reachable for regulatory prioritized services, the SMF does not include any N2 SM info regarding the PDU Session for non-regulatory prioritized services to avoid establishment of radio resources at the target NG-RAN. If the SMF receives notification from (T-)AMF that UE is only reachable for regulatory prioritized service after this step via Namf_EventExposure_Notify, the SMF deactivates the PDU Session after handover procedure finish if the PDU Session is not for regulatory prioritized services.\n8.\tAMF supervises the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response messages from the involved SMFs. The lowest value of the Max delay indications for the PDU Sessions that are candidates for handover gives the maximum time AMF may wait for Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response messages before continuing with the N2 Handover procedure. At expiry of the maximum wait time or when all Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response messages are received, AMF continues with the N2 Handover procedure (Handover Request message in step 9).\nNOTE 2:\tThe delay value for each PDU Session is locally configured in the AMF and implementation specific.\n9.\tT-AMF to T-RAN: Handover Request (Source to Target transparent container, N2 MM Information, N2 SM Information list, Tracing Requirements, UE Radio Capability ID). If the subscription information includes Tracing Requirements, the target AMF provides the target RAN with Tracing Requirements in the Handover Request.\nT-AMF determines T-RAN based on Target ID. T-AMF may allocate a 5G-GUTI valid for the UE in the AMF and target TAI.\nSource to Target transparent container is forwarded as received from S-RAN. N2 MM Information includes e.g. security information and Mobility Restriction List if available in the T-AMF.\nN2 SM Information list includes N2 SM Information received from SMFs for the T-RAN in the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response messages received within allowed max delay supervised by the T-AMF mentioned in step 8.\nT-AMF provides the UE Radio Capability ID to T-RAN if RACS is supported. If the UE Radio Capability ID is included in the Handover Request message and no UE radio access capabilities are provided in the Source to Target transparent container, when there is no corresponding UE radio capabilities set for UE Radio Capability ID at T-RAN, T-RAN shall request the T-AMF to provide the UE radio capabilities set corresponding to UE Radio Capability ID to the T-RAN. If the Source to Target transparent container contains the UE radio access capabilities and the T-RAN did not receive the UE Radio Capability ID from the T-AMF, NG-RAN shall proceed with handover using the received UE radio access capabilities. If the T-RAN received both the UE radio access capabilities and the UE Radio Capability ID, then the T-RAN shall use any locally stored UE radio access capability information corresponding to the UE Radio Capability ID. If none are stored locally, the T-RAN may request the full UE radio access capability information from the core network. If the full UE radio access capability information is not promptly received from the core network, or the T-RAN chooses not to request them, then the T-RAN shall proceed with the UE radio access capabilities sent by the source RAN node. The T-RAN shall not use the UE radio access capability information received from the source RAN node for any other UE with the same the UE Radio Capability ID.\n10.\tT-RAN to T-AMF: Handover Request Acknowledge (Target to Source transparent container, List of PDU Sessions to Hand-over with N2 SM information, List of PDU Sessions that failed to be established with the failure cause given in the N2 SM information element, PDU Set Based Handling Support Indication included in the N2 SM information).\nTarget to Source transparent container includes a UE container with an access stratum part and a NAS part. The UE container is sent transparently via T-AMF, S-AMF and S-RAN to the UE. If DAPS handover is supported by the T-RAN and T-AMF and the DAPS Information for one or more DRBs had been received in the Source to Target Transparent Container, the T-RAN includes the DAPS Response information in the Target to Source Transparent Container as described in TS 38.300 [9].\nT-RAN creates List Of PDU Sessions failed to be setup and reason for failure (e.g. T-RAN decision, S-NSSAI is not available, unable to fulfil User Plane Security Enforcement) based on T-RAN determination. The information is provided to the S-RAN.\nThe N2 SM information in the List Of PDU Sessions to Hand-over, contains per each PDU Session ID T-RAN N3 addressing information i.e. N3 UP address and Tunnel ID of T-RAN for the PDU Session.\nIf redundant transmission is performed for one or more QoS Flows of the PDU Session, the T-RAN provides two AN Tunnel Info for the PDU Session in the N2 SM information. The T-RAN indicates to the SMF one of the AN Tunnel Info is used as the redundancy tunnel of the PDU session as described in clause 5.33.2.2 of TS 23.501 [2]. If only one AN Tunnel Info is provided by the Target NG-RAN for the PDU session, the SMF may release these QoS Flows by triggering PDU Session Modification procedure as specified in clause 4.3.3 after the handover procedure.\nThe N2 SM information may also include:\n-\tan Indication whether UP integrity protection is performed or not on the PDU Session based on User Plane Security Enforcement information received in N2 SM information in step 9.\n-\tif the PDU Session has at least one QoS Flow subject for data forwarding, N3 UP address and Tunnel ID of T-RAN for receiving forwarded data. The T-RAN provides data forwarding addresses for each data forwarding tunnel which it decided to setup.\n-\tFor each QoS Flow accepted with an Alternative QoS Profile (see TS 23.501 [2]), the Target NG-RAN shall include a reference to the fulfilled Alternative QoS Profile.\n-\tFor each accepted QoS Flow, established QoS Flows status (active/not active) for one of the following: congestion information monitoring, ECN marking for L4S at PSA UPF, ECN marking for L4S at NG-RAN.\n-\tPDU Set Based Handling Support Indication as described in clause 5.37.5.3 of TS 23.501 [2].\n11a.\tAMF to SMF: Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request (PDU Session ID, N2 SM response received from T-RAN in step 10).\nFor each N2 SM response received from the T-RAN (N2 SM information included in Handover Request Acknowledge), AMF sends the received N2 SM response to the SMF indicated by the respective PDU Session ID.\nIf no new T-UPF is selected, SMF stores the N3 tunnel info of T-RAN from the N2 SM response if N2 handover is accepted by T-RAN.\nThe SMF/UPF allocates the N3 UP address and Tunnel IDs for indirect data forwarding corresponding to the data forwarding tunnel endpoints established by T-RAN.\nIf a PDU Session is indicated as a rejected PDU Session by the Target NG-RAN with an indication that the PDU session was rejected because User Plane Security Enforcement is not supported in the Target NG-RAN and the User Plane Enforcement Policy indicates \"Required\" as described in clause 5.10.3 of TS 23.501 [2], the SMF triggers the release of this PDU Session. In all other cases of PDU Session rejection, the SMF can decide whether to release the PDU Session (possibly triggering the re-establishment of the PDU Session as described in step 5) or to deactivate the UP connection of this PDU Session.\nIf some of the QoS Flows of a PDU Session are not accepted by the Target NG-RAN, the SMF shall initiate the PDU Session Modification procedure to remove the non-accepted QoS Flows from the PDU Session(s) after the handover procedure is completed.\n11b.\t[Conditional] SMF to T-UPF: N4 Session Modification Request (T-RAN SM N3 forwarding Information list, indication to allocate DL forwarding tunnel(s) for indirect forwarding)\nIf the SMF selected a T-UPF in step 6a, the SMF updates the T-UPF by providing the T-RAN SM N3 forwarding information list by sending a N4 Session Modification Request to the T-UPF.\nIf indirect forwarding applies based on indication from the S-RAN and the UPF is re-allocated and if the SMF decides to setup the indirect forwarding tunnel on the same T-UPF, the SMF also requests in the N4 Session Modification Request message to the T-UPF, to allocate DL forwarding tunnel(s) for indirect forwarding.\nIndirect forwarding may be performed via a UPF which is different from the T-UPF, in which case the SMF selects a T-UPF for indirect forwarding.\n11c.\t[Conditional] T-UPF to SMF: N4 Session Modification Response (T-UPF SM N3 forwarding Information list).\nThe T-UPF allocates Tunnel Info and returns an N4 Session Modification Response message to the SMF.\nThe T-UPF SM N3 forwarding info list includes T-UPF N3 address, T-UPF N3 Tunnel identifiers for forwarding data\n11d.\t[Conditional] SMF to S-UPF: N4 Session Modification Request (T-RAN SM N3 forwarding Information list or T-UPF SM N3 forwarding Information list, indication to allocate DL forwarding tunnel(s) for indirect forwarding).\nIf the UPF is re-allocated, this message includes the T-UPF SM N3 forwarding info list. If the UPF is not re-allocated, this message includes the T-RAN SM N3 forwarding info list.\nIf indirect forwarding applies based on indication from NG-RAN and UPF allocates tunnel identities, the SMF indicates in the N4 Session Modification Request message to the S-UPF to allocate DL forwarding tunnel(s) for indirect forwarding.\nIndirect forwarding may be performed via a UPF which is different from the S-UPF.\n11e.\t[Conditional] S-UPF to SMF: N4 Session Modification Response (S-UPF SM N3 forwarding Information list).\nThe S-UPF allocates Tunnel Info and returns an N4 Session establishment Response message to the SMF.\nThe S-UPF SM N3 forwarding Information list includes S-UPF N3 address, S-UPF N3 Tunnel identifiers for DL data forwarding.\n11f.\tSMF to T-AMF: Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response (N2 SM Information).\nThe SMF sends an Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response message per PDU Session to T-AMF.\nThe SMF creates an N2 SM information containing the DL forwarding Tunnel Info to be sent to the S-RAN by the AMF. The SMF includes this information in the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext response. The DL forwarding Tunnel Info can be one of the following information:\n-\tIf direct forwarding applies, then the SMF includes the T-RAN N3 forwarding information the SMF received in step 11a.\n-\tIf the indirect forwarding tunnel is setup in step 11b or 11d, then the SMF includes the T-UPF or S-UPF DL forwarding information containing the N3 UP address and the DL Tunnel ID of the UPF.\n12.\t[Conditional] T-AMF to S-AMF: Namf_Communication_CreateUEContext Response (N2 information necessary for S-AMF to send Handover Command to S-RAN including Target to Source transparent container, PDU Sessions failed to be setup list, N2 SM information (N3 DL forwarding Information, PCF ID), [Target AMF ID]).\nT-AMF supervises the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response message from the involved SMFs. At expiry of the maximum wait time or when all Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response messages are received, T-AMF sends the Namf_Communication_CreateUEContext Response to the S-AMF.\nThe PDU Sessions failed to be setup list includes the List Of PDU Sessions failed to be setup received from target RAN in step 10 and the Non-accepted PDU session List generated by the T-AMF.\nNon-accepted PDU Session List includes following PDU Session(s) with proper cause value:\n-\tNon-accepted PDU Session(s) by the SMF(s);\n-\tNon-accepted PDU Session(s) by the AMF due to no response from the SMF within maximum wait time; and\n-\tNon-accepted PDU Session(s) by the AMF due to non-available S-NSSAI in the T-AMF, which is decided at step 4.\nThe Target to Source transport container is received from the T-RAN. The N2 SM Information is received from the SMF in step 11f.\nIf target AMF re-allocation is executed in step 3, the selected final target AMF, i.e. T-AMF, invoke Namf_Communication_CreateUEContext Response (Cause, N2 information necessary for S-AMF to send Handover Command to S-RAN including Target to Source transparent container, N2 SM information (PDU Sessions failed to setup list, N3 DL forwarding Information), PCF ID, PCF reselected indication, target AMF ID) to the initial AMF. The cause indicates whether the Relocate UE Context (hand-Over) succeeded or failed. If the target NG RAN has rejected the Handover Request in step 10, the cause indicates a failure due to RAN rejection. The target AMF ID is used for S-AMF to transfer RAN Status to T-AMF directly. Based on the receiving Namf_Communication_CreateUEContext Response, the initial AMF invokes Namf_Communication_CreateUEContext Response towards S-AMF.",

      "content": "Figure 4.9.1.3.3-1: inter NG-RAN node N2 based handover, execution phase\nNOTE 1:\tRegistration of serving AMF with the UDM is not shown in the figure for brevity.\n1.\tS-AMF to S-RAN: Handover Command (Target to Source transparent container, List Of PDU Sessions to be handed-over with N2 SM information containing information received from T-RAN during the handover preparation phase, List Of PDU Sessions failed to be setup).\nTarget to Source transparent container is forwarded as received from S-AMF. If DAPS Response information for one or more DRBs is received by S-RAN and indicates that DAPS handover is accepted, the execution phase for DAPS handover procedure as described in clause 4.9.1.3.3a is performed.\nThe SM forwarding info list includes T-RAN SM N3 forwarding info list for direct forwarding or S-UPF SM N3 forwarding info list for indirect data forwarding\nS-RAN uses the PDU Sessions failed to be setup list and the indicated reason for failure to decide whether to proceed with the N2 Handover procedure.\nIf the S-RAN supports and receives a reference to an Alternative QoS Profile for an accepted QoS Flow, it shall take it into account for deciding whether or not to proceed with the N2 Handover procedure (see TS 23.501 [2]).\n2.\tS-RAN to UE: Handover Command (UE container).\nUE container is a UE part of the Target to Source transparent container which is sent transparently from T-RAN via AMF to S-RAN and is provided to the UE by the S-RAN.\n2a0.\tIf the PLMN has configured secondary RAT usage reporting and the source NG-RAN has Secondary RAT usage data to report, the source NG-RAN node may provide RAN usage data report message (N2 SM Information (Secondary RAT usage data), Handover Flag) as in clause 4.21 to the AMF. The Handover Flag indicates to the AMF that it should buffer the N2 SM Information containing the usage data report before forwarding it.\nNOTE 2:\tThis step is not shown in this figure but the secondary RAT usage data reporting procedure is shown in figure 4.21-1 in clause 4.21.\n2a. - 2c.\tThe S-RAN sends the Uplink RAN Status Transfer message to the S-AMF, as specified in TS 36.300 [46] and TS 38.300 [9]. The S-RAN may omit sending this message if none of the radio bearers of the UE shall be treated with PDCP status preservation. In the case of time-based handover, the S-RAN sends the Uplink RAN Early Status Transfer message to the S-AMF as specified in TS 38.413 [10].\nIf there is an AMF relocation, the S-AMF sends this information to the T-AMF via the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation and the T-AMF acknowledges. The S-AMF or, if the AMF is relocated, the T-AMF, sends the information to the T-RAN via the Downlink RAN Status Transfer message, as specified in TS 36.300 [46] and TS 38.300 [9]. In the case of time-based handover, the T-AMF sends the Downlink RAN Early Status Transfer message to the T-RAN as specified in TS 38.413 [10].\nFor Inter PLMN handover, if the target AMF has been relocated in Preparation phase, e.g. due to the inter PLMN handover, the S-AMF send this information to the indicated T-AMF, which is derived from the target AMF ID received in step 12 of clause 4.9.1.3.2.\n3.\tUplink packets are sent from T-RAN to T-UPF and UPF (PSA). Downlink packets are sent from UPF (PSA) to S-RAN via S-UPF. The S-RAN should start forwarding of downlink data from the S-RAN towards the T-RAN for QoS Flows or DRBs subject to data forwarding. This may be either direct (step 3a) or indirect forwarding (step 3b).\n4.\tUE to T-RAN: Handover Confirm.\nAfter the UE has successfully synchronized to the target cell, it sends a Handover Confirm message to the T-RAN. Handover is by this message considered as successful by the UE.\n5.\tT-RAN to T-AMF: Handover Notify.\nHandover is by this message considered as successful in T-RAN.\n6a.\t[Conditional] T-AMF to S-AMF: Namf_Communication_N2InfoNotify.\nThe T-AMF notifies to the S-AMF about the N2 handover notify received from the T-RAN by invoking the Namf_Communication_N2InfoNotify.\nA timer in S-AMF is started to supervise when resources in S-RAN shall be release.\n6b.\t[Conditional] S-AMF to T-AMF: Namf_Communication_N2InfoNotify ACK (N2 SM Information (Secondary RAT usage data)).\nThe S-AMF acknowledges by sending the Namf_Communication_N2InfoNotify ACK to the T-AMF. The N2 SM Information here is the one buffered at step 2a0 when applicable.\n6c.\t[Conditional] S-AMF to SMF: Nsmf_PDUSession_ReleaseSMContext Request (SM Context ID, N2 SM Information (Secondary RAT Usage Data)).\nIf the PDU Session(s) is not accepted by the T-AMF (e.g. S-NSSAI associated with the PDU Session is not available in the T-AMF), S-AMF triggers PDU Session Release procedure as specified in clause 4.3.4.2 after the S-AMF is notified for the reception of N2 Handover Notify in step 6a.\n7.\tT-AMF to SMF: Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request (Handover Complete indication for PDU Session ID, UE presence in LADN service area, N2 SM Information (Secondary RAT usage data)). The N2 SM Information here is the one received at step 6b when applicable.\nHandover Complete indication is sent per each PDU Session to the corresponding SMF to indicate the success of the N2 Handover.\nWhen an Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response message arrived too late during the handover preparation phase (see step 8 of clause 4.9.1.3.2), or the PDU Session with SMF involvement is not accepted by T-RAN, Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request (SM Context ID, Operation Type) is sent to the corresponding SMF allowing the SMF to deallocate a possibly allocated N3 UP address and Tunnel ID of the selected UPF. A PDU Session handled by that SMF is considered deactivated and handover attempt is terminated for that PDU Session.\nIn the case that the AMF determines that the PDU Session is related to a LADN then the AMF provides the \"UE presence in LADN service area\". If the AMF does not provide the \"UE presence in LADN service area\" indication and the SMF determines that the DNN corresponds to a LADN, then the SMF considers that the UE is OUT of the LADN service area.\nThe SMF takes actions for the LADN PDU Session as defined in clause 5.6.5 of TS 23.501 [2] based on the \"UE presence in LADN service area\" indication.\nFor each QoS Flow for which the SMF has received a reference to the fulfilled Alternative QoS Profile in step 10 of clause 4.9.1.3.2, the SMF notifies the PCF and the UE as described in TS 23.501 [2].\n8a.\t[Conditional] SMF to T-UPF (intermediate): N4 Session Modification Request.\nIf new T-UPF is inserted or an existing intermediate S-UPF is re-allocated, the SMF shall send N4 Session Modification Request indicating DL AN Tunnel Info of T-RAN to the T-UPF.\n8b.\t[Conditional] T-UPF to SMF: N4 Session Modification Response.\nThe T-UPF acknowledges by sending N4 Session Modification Response message to SMF.\n9a.\t[Conditional] SMF to S-UPF (intermediate): N4 Session Modification Request.\nIf UPF is not re-allocated, the SMF shall send N4 Session Modification Request indicating DL AN Tunnel Info of T-RAN to the S-UPF.\n9b.\t[Conditional] S-UPF to SMF: N4 Session Modification Response.\nThe S-UPF acknowledges by sending N4 Session Modification Response message to SMF.\n10a.\t[Conditional] SMF to UPF (PSA): N4 Session Modification Request.\nFor non-roaming or local breakout roaming scenario, the SMF sends N4 Session Modification Request message to PDU Session Anchor UPF, UPF (PSA), providing N3 AN Tunnel Info of T-RAN or the DL CN Tunnel Info of T-UPF if a new T-UPF is inserted or an existing intermediate S-UPF is re-allocated. If redundant transmission is performed for one or more QoS Flows of the PDU Session, two N3 AN Tunnel Info of T-RAN or two DL CN Tunnel Info of two T-UPFs are provided and the SMF indicates to the UPF (PSA) one of the AN/CN Tunnel Info is used as redundancy tunnel of the PDU Session. If the existing intermediate S-UPF terminating N9 toward the H-UPF (PDU Session Anchor) is re-allocated for the home routed roaming scenario, the V-SMF invokes an Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request (DL CN Tunnel Info) service operation toward the H-SMF.\nIn the case of the S-UPF acts as a UL CL or BP, the SMF indicates only one of the PDU Session Anchors to send the \"end marker\" packets. To ensure the \"end marker\" is the last user plane packet on the old path, the SMF should modify the path on other PDU Session Anchors before it indicates the PDU Session Anchor to send the \"end marker\" packets.\nIf T-UPF is not inserted or an existing intermediate S-UPF is not re-allocated, step 10a and step 10b are skipped.\n10b.\t[Conditional] UPF (PSA) to SMF: N4 Session Modification Response.\nThe UPF (PSA) sends N4 Session Modification Response message to SMF. In order to assist the reordering function in the T-RAN, the UPF (PSA) sends one or more \"end marker\" packets for each N3 tunnel on the old path immediately after switching the path, the source NG-RAN shall forward the \"end marker\" packets to the Target NG-RAN. At this point, UPF (PSA) starts sending downlink packets to the T-RAN, via T-UPF if a new T-UPF is inserted or an existing intermediate S-UPF is re-allocated. In the case of home routed roaming scenario, the H-SMF responds with the Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Response service operation to V-SMF once the H-UPF (PDU Session Anchor) is updated with the UL Tunnel Info of the T-UPF.\nWhen there are multiple UPFs(PSA), step 10a and step 10b are performed for each UPFs(PSA).\n11.\tSMF to T-AMF: Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response (PDU Session ID).\nSMF confirms reception of Handover Complete.\nIf indirect data forwarding applies, the SMF starts an indirect data forwarding timer, to be used to release the resource of indirect data forwarding tunnel.\n12.\tThe UE initiates Mobility Registration Update procedure as described in clause 4.2.2.2.2.\nThe target AMF knows that it is a Handover procedure and therefore the target AMF performs only a subset of the Registration procedure, specifically the steps 4, 5 and 10 in the Registration procedure for the context transfer between source AMF and target AMF are skipped.\nThe target AMF, based on the S-NSSAIs subject to Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization status information from source AMF in step 3 of clause 4.9.1.3.2, may decide to skip step 25 in the Registration procedure (i.e. NSSAA procedure) or whether to perform it if the status is pending.\n13a.\t[Conditional] SMF to S-UPF (intermediate): N4 Session Release Request.\nIf there is a source intermediate UPF, the SMF initiates resource release, after timer in step 6 or indirect data forwarding timer expires, by sending an N4 Session Release Request (Release Cause) to source UPF. This message is also used to release the indirect data forwarding resource in S-UPF.\n13b.\tS-UPF to SMF: N4 Session Release Response.\nThe S-UPF acknowledges with an N4 Session Release Response message to confirm the release of resources.\nIn the case of indirect data forwarding, the resource of indirect data forwarding is also released.\n14a.\tAMF to S-RAN: UE Context Release Command ().\nAfter the timer in step 6a expires, the AMF sends UE Context Release Command.\n14b.\tS-RAN to AMF: UE Context Release Complete ().\nThe source NG-RAN releases its resources related to the UE and responds with a UE Context Release Complete () message.\n15a.\t[Conditional] SMF to T-UPF: N4 Session Modification Request.\nIf indirect forwarding applies and UPF is re-allocated, after timer of indirect data forwarding expires, the SMF sends N4 Session Modification Request to T-UPF to release the indirect data forwarding resource.\n15b.\t[Conditional] T-UPF to SMF: N4 Session Modification Response.\nThe T-UPF acknowledges with an N4 Session Modification Response message to confirm the release of indirect data forwarding resources.\nIf the AMF is subscribed to Mobility Event by other NFs, the AMF notifies the event to the corresponding NFs by invoking the Namf_EventExposure_Notify service operation as described in clause 4.15.4.2.\nUpon reception of the Namf_EventExposure_Notify with an indication that UE is reachable only for regulatory prioritized service, the SMF deactivates the PDU Session if the service of the PDU Session is not regulatory prioritized. For home routed roaming case, the V-SMF triggers the deactivation of the PDU Session, in addition, the H-SMF refrains from sending downlink signalling if the signalling is not related to regulatory prioritized service upon receiving the notification.\n4.9.1.3.3a\tExecution phase for DAPS handover\nThis procedure applies only if at the end of the Preparation phase it has been determined that at least one DRB of the UE is subject to a DAPS related Handover.\nFigure 4.9.1.3.3a-1: inter NG-RAN node N2 based DAPS handover, execution phase\n1 to 2.\tSame as step 1 to step 2 in clause 4.9.1.3.3 with the following difference.\nDAPS Response information received in the Target to Source Transparent Container indicates the DAPS handover is accepted for one or more DRBs.\n2a to 2c.\tThe S-RAN sends the Uplink RAN Early Status Transfer message to the S-AMF as specified in TS 38.413 [10]. For the DRBs not subjecting to DAPS, steps 2a to 2c in clause 4.9.1.3.3 may be performed.\nIf there is an AMF change, the S-AMF sends this information to the T-AMF via the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation and the T-AMF acknowledges. The S-AMF or, if the AMF is relocated, the T-AMF, sends the information to the T-RAN via the Downlink RAN Early Status Transfer message, as specified in TS 38.413 [10].\n3.\tSame as step 3 in clause 4.9.1.3.3.\n4.\tSame as step 4 in clause 4.9.1.3.3.\n5.\tT-RAN to T-AMF: same as step 5 in clause 4.9.1.3.3 with the difference that the Handover Notify includes a Notify Source NG-RAN node information which is used to notify the S-RAN that the UE has successfully accessed the T-RAN.\n6a.\t[Conditional] T-AMF to S-AMF: Namf_Communication_N2InfoNotify.\nThe T-AMF notifies the S-AMF as in step 6a in clause 4.9.1.3.3 with the difference that Notify Source NG-RAN node information is included.\n6b.\t[Conditional] S-AMF to T-AMF: Namf_Communication_N2InfoNotify ACK.\nThe S-AMF acknowledges by sending the Namf_Communication_N2InfoNotify ACK to the T-AMF as in step 6b in clause 4.9.1.3.3.\n7.\tS-AMF to S-RAN: Handover Success.\nThe S-AMF informs the S-RAN node that the UE has successfully accessed the T-RAN as described in TS 38.413 [10], S-RAN stops the UL data transfer for the UE.\n8a to 8c.\tThe S-RAN initiates step 8a. Step 8a to 8c are the same as step 2a to 2c in clause 4.9.1.3.3 for the DRB(s) subject to DAPS.\n9.\tStep 6c to step 15 in clause 4.9.1.3.3 are performed.",

      "content": "This procedure is used by an AMF to request the NG-RAN to report where the UE is currently located when the target UE is in CM-CONNECTED state. The need for the NG-RAN to continue reporting ceases when the UE transitions to CM-IDLE or the AMF sends cancel indication to NG-RAN. This procedure may be used for services that require accurate cell identification (e.g. emergency services, lawful intercept, charging), or for subscription to the service by other NFs. When Dual Connectivity is activated, PSCell information is only reported if requested by the AMF.\nFigure 4.10-1: NG-RAN Location Reporting Procedure\n1.\tAMF to NG-RAN: Location Reporting Control (Reporting Type, Location Reporting Level, (Area Of Interest, Request Reference ID)).\nThe AMF sends a Location Reporting Control message to the NG-RAN. The Location Reporting Control message shall identify the UE for which reports are requested and shall include Reporting Type and Location Reporting Level. The Location Reporting Control message may also include Area Of Interest and Request Reference ID. Location Reporting Level could be TAI+ Cell Identity. Reporting Type indicates whether the message is intended to trigger a single standalone report about the current Cell Identity serving the UE or start the NG-RAN to report whenever the UE changes cell, or ask the NG-RAN to report whenever the UE moves out or into the Area Of Interest. If the Reporting Type indicates to report whenever the UE changes cell and if PScell reporting is requested and Dual Connectivity is in use, the Master RAN node shall also report to the AMF whenever the PSCell changes. If the Reporting Type indicates to start the NG-RAN to report when UE moves out of or into the Area Of Interest, the AMF also provides the requested Area Of Interest information in the Location Reporting Control message. The AMF may include a Request Reference ID in the Location Report Control message to identify the request of reporting for an Area Of Interest. If multiple Areas Of Interest are included in the message, the Request Reference ID identifies each Area of Interest.\nNOTE 1:\tRequesting reports whenever the UE changes cell can increase signalling load on multiple interfaces. Requesting reports for all changes in PSCell ID can further increase signalling load. Hence it is recommended that any such reporting is only applied for a limited number of subscribers.\n2.\tNG-RAN to AMF: Location Report (UE Location, UE Presence in Area Of Interest, Request Reference ID, Timestamp).\nThe NG-RAN sends a Location Report message informing the AMF about the location of the UE which shall be represented as the requested Location Reporting Level. If PSCell reporting is requested and Dual Connectivity is activated, then the Master NG-RAN node shall also include the PSCell ID. With NR satellite access, cell and TAI reporting by NG-RAN refer to a fixed cell and fixed TA in which a UE is geographically located. As part of the User Location Information, NG_RAN also reports one or more TACs for the Selected PLMN as described in TS 38.413 [10], but it is not guaranteed that the UE is always located in one of these TACs.\nWhen UE is in CM-CONNECTED with RRC_INACTIVE state, if NG-RAN has received Location Reporting Control message from AMF with the Reporting Type indicating single stand-alone report, the NG-RAN shall perform NG-RAN paging before reporting the location to the AMF. The NG-RAN should send the Location Report promptly and shall not wait to attempt to create a Dual Connectivity configuration. However, if PSCell reporting is requested and the PSCell ID is known to the Master RAN node, then it shall be included in the Location Report. In the case of RAN paging failure, the RAN reports UE's last known location with time stamp.\nWhen UE is in CM-CONNECTED with RRC_INACTIVE state, if NG-RAN has received Location Reporting Control message from AMF with the Reporting Type indicating continuous reporting whenever the UE changes cell, the NG-RAN shall send a Location Report message to the AMF including the UE's last known location with time stamp. If the UE was using Dual Connectivity immediately before entering CM-CONNECTED with RRC_INACTIVE state and PSCell reporting is requested, then the Location Report shall also include the PSCell ID.\nWhen UE is in CM-CONNECTED, if NG-RAN has received Location Reporting Control message from AMF with the Reporting Type of Area Of Interest based reporting, the NG-RAN shall track the UE presence in Area Of Interest and send a Location Report message to AMF including the UE Presence in the Area Of Interest (i.e. IN, OUT, or UNKNOWN) as described in clause D.2 and the UE's current location (including the PSCell ID if PSCell reporting is requested and Dual Connectivity is activated) when the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED state, or, when the UE is in RRC_INACTIVE state, the UE's last known location (including the PSCell ID if PSCell reporting is requested and the UE was using Dual Connectivity immediately before entering CM-CONNECTED with RRC_INACTIVE state) with time stamp if the NG-RAN perceives that the UE presence in the Area Of Interest is different from the last one reported. When the NG-RAN detects that the UE has moved out of or into multiple areas of interest, it sends multiple pairs of UE Presence in the Area Of Interest and the Request Reference ID in one Location Report message to AMF. If UE transitions from RRC_INACTIVE state to RRC_CONNECTED state, NG-RAN shall check the latest location (including the PSCell ID if PSCell reporting is requested and Dual Connectivity is activated) of UE and follow the rules when UE is in RRC_CONNECTED.\nThe AMF may receive Location Report even if the UE presence in Area Of Interest is not changed. The AMF stores the latest received PSCell ID with its associated timestamp. The AMF stores the latest received PSCell ID with its associated timestamp, when available.\nIn addition to the above, if the UE is served by an authorized MSBR and the AMF serving this UE receives the Location Report including the TAI/NR CGI for the MBSR that UE is accessing, the AMF shall, if supported, update the corresponding Warning Area List NG-RAN specified in TS 23.041 [86]\n3.\tAMF to NG-RAN: Cancel Location Report (Reporting Type, Request Reference ID).\nThe AMF can send a Cancel Location Reporting message to inform the NG-RAN that it should terminate the location reporting for a given UE corresponding to the Reporting Type or the location reporting for Area Of Interest indicated by Request Reference ID. This message is needed when the reporting type was requested for continuously reporting or for the Area Of Interest. The AMF may include the Request Reference ID which indicates the requested Location Reporting Control for the Area Of Interest, so that the NG-RAN should terminate the location reporting for the Area Of Interest.\nNOTE 2:\tLocation reporting related information of the source NG-RAN node is transferred to the target NG-RAN node during Xn handover.\nIn this release the location reporting procedure is applicable only to 3GPP access.",

If the SMF+PGW-C also supports URSP Provisioning Support in EPS and ePCO, it selects a PCF which also supports URSP Provisioning in EPS to establish the SM Policy Association based on the received Indication of URSP Provisioning Support in EPS PCO and local configuration. The SMF+PGW-C then provides the \"Indication of URSP Provisioning Support in EPS\" in the ePCO to the UE.\nWhen the SMF+PGW-C receives the UE Policy Container ePCO in Bearer Resource Command during UE requested bearer resource modification procedure, it forwards transparently the UE Policy Container to PCF for the PDU Session in the Npcf_SMPolicyControl_Update Request including indication that \"UE Policy Container received\" PCRT was met. When the PCF for Session Management receives UE Policy Container from PCF for the UE, it forwards the UE Policy Container to SMF+PGW-C in Npcf_SMPolicyControl_UpdateNotify Request. The PCF for the PDU Session retrieves the PCRTs for UE Policy from PCF for the UE and subscribe to the applicable PCRTs in EPC to SMF+PGW-C.\nDuring initial attach or PDN connection establishment procedure, if SMF+PGW-C supports URSP provisioning in EPS, PCF for the UE and PCF for the PDU session may be discovered as indicated in clause 5.2.7.3.2 by indicating the URSP delivery in EPS capability to NRF.\nDuring initial registration in 5GS, if 5GS supports URSP provisioning in EPS, PCF for the UE and PCF for the PDU session may be discovered as indicated in clause 5.2.7.3.2 by indicating the URSP delivery in EPS capability to NRF. During 5GS to EPS mobility, PCF for the PDU session discovers PCF for the UE is in BSF.\nWhen URSP Provisioning is supported in EPS, the PCF for the PDU Session may establish the UE Policy Association with PCF for the UE:\n-\tWhen the first UE Policy Container is received from the UE for an SM Policy association.\n-\tDuring 5GS to EPS mobility with N26 when the SMF+PGW-C notifies the PCF for the PDU Session about a RAT-Type change via Npcf_SMPolicyControl_Update.\nNOTE 1:\tIf there are more than one PCF for the PDU session handling PDU sessions for the UE, during the 5GS to EPS mobility every involved PCF for the PDU session can establish a UE Policy Association with the PCF for the UE.\nThe PCF for the UE triggers the re-evaluation of applicable URSPs in the cases as described in clause 6.1.2.2.3 of TS 23.503 [20] and determines whether an update of URSP is needed for the UE. The PCF for the UE generates the URSP and sends it to the PCF for the PDU Session in the UE Policy Container via Npcf_UEPolicyControl_UpdateNotify Request.\nThe procedures for the UE Policy association defined in clauses 4.16.11, 4.16.12 and 4.16.13 apply in EPS with the main differences below:\n-\tAMF is replaced by the PCF for the PDU Session.\n-\tDelivery of UE Policy Containers from the PCF for the UE to the PCF for the PDU Session is done via Npcf_UEPolicyControl service instead of via UE Configuration Update procedure.\n-\tDelivery of UE Policy Containers from the SMF+PGW-C to the UE is done via PDN GW initiated bearer modification without QoS update procedure as specified in clause 4.11.0a.2a.10.\nURSP delivery via EPS is also supported in roaming scenarios, both for a PDN connection established in Home Routed and for a PDN connection established in LBO.\nNOTE 2:\tIf the PCF for the PDU Session is the same as the PCF for the UE, the interactions between them are internal to the PCF.\n4.11.0a.2a.1\tSM Policy Association Establishment\nThe following additions are applicable to clause 4.16.4 (SM Policy Association Establishment procedure):\n-\tIn addition to step 4 the PCF determines whether the PDN connection supports the provisioning of URSP rules in EPS by checking URSP delivery in EPS support indication provided by the SMF+PGW-C. The SMF+PGW-C provides that indication based on local capabilities and operator policies. The PCF may receive the URSP delivery in EPS support indication provided by the SMF+PGW-C and store the indication for the following use (for example, URSP rule provision to UE during 5GS to EPS mobility).\n4.11.0a.2a.1a\tSM Policy Association Establishment in EPS\nThe following enhancement is applicable to clause 4.11.0a.2 which refers to clause 4.16.4 (SM Policy Association Establishment):\n-\tStep 1 of clause 4.16.4: If the SMF+PGW-C receives URSP Provisioning Support indication, the SMF+PGW-C selects the PCF based on the URSP delivery in EPS capability of the PCF, as defined in clause 6.3.7.1 of TS 23.501 [2].\n4.11.0a.2a.2\tSMF initiated SM Policy Association Modification\n4.11.0a.2a.2.1\tSMF initiated SM Policy Association Modification due to UE requested bearer resource modification procedure\nWhen SMF+PGW-C receives the UE Policy Container in the UE requested bearer resource modification procedure, the SMF+PGW-C provides the UE Policy Container to the PCF.\nThe SM Policy Association Modification procedure in clause 4.16.5.1 applies with the following enhancements is executed with the following differences, applicable between step 4 and step 5:\nIf the PCF receives both the indication that the PCRT \"UE Policy Container received\" was met and the UE Policy Container, steps 4a to 4c below are executed.\n-\tStep 4a: The PCF for the PDU Session discovers the PCF for the UE by querying the BSF, using Nbsf_Management_Discovery for the SUPI. If no result is obtained from the BSF the PCF for the PDU Session selects the PCF for the UE by querying NRF, using the URSP delivery in EPS capability of the PCF, as defined in clause 6.3.7.1 of TS 23.501 [2].\n-\tStep 4b: The PCF for the PDU Session establishes a UE Policy Association towards the PCF for the UE as described in clause 4.11.0a.2a.5.\n-\tStep 4c: If the PCF for the UE provides any Policy Control Request Trigger parameters in the Npcf_UEPolicyControl Create Response the PCF for the PDU Session takes them into account for the generation of Policy Control Request Triggers to the SMF+PGW-C.\n4.11.0a.2a.2.2\tSMF initiated SM Policy Association Modification at mobility between 5GS and EPS\nDuring 5GS to EPS mobility procedure, the PCF for the PDU Session establishes a UE Policy Association towards the PCF for the UE if it exists otherwise, it performs PCF discovery and selection then establishes a UE Policy Association. During EPS to 5GS mobility procedure the PCF for the PDU Session terminates the UE Policy Association, if established during 5GS to EPS mobility.\nNOTE:\tIf there are more than one PCF for the PDU session handling PDU sessions for the UE every involved PCF for the PDU session can establish a UE Policy Association with the PCF for the UE.\nThe following enhancements are applicable to clause 4.16.5.1 (SMF initiated SM Policy Association Modification procedure):\nIn addition to step 4 in clause 4.16.5.1, the PCF determines that 5GS to EPS or EPS to 5GS mobility applies by checking a change in RAT and Access-Type.\n-\tIf 5GS to EPS mobility applies, , in non-roaming and Home Routed roaming the (H-)PCF for the PDU Session determines whether the UE supports provisioning of URSP Rules in EPS by checking indication of support of URSP delivery in EPS in UDR and in LBO roaming the V-PCF for the PDU Session determine whether the UE supports provisioning of URSP rules in EPS based on local configuration, e.g. using the PEI, given that the V-PCF has no access to UDR at the HPLMN. The (H-)PCF or the V-PCF determines if the SMF+PGW-C supports delivery of URSP Rules in EPS as reported by the SMF+PGW-C. If the PCF determines that the UE and the SMF+PGW-C support provisioning of URSP Rules in EPS, the PCF for the PDU Session finds the PCF for the UE using Nbsf_Management_Discovery for the SUPI and then performs UE Policy Association Establishment procedure as specified in clause 4.11.0a.2a.5. If no result is obtained from the BSF, the PCF for the PDU Session selects the PCF for the UE by querying NRF, using the URSP delivery in EPS capability of the PCF, as defined in clause 6.3.7.1 of TS 23.501 [2].\n-\tIf EPS to 5GS mobility applies, the PCF for the PDU Session requests the termination of the UE Policy association as described in clause 4.11.0a.2a.8.\n4.11.0a.2a.2.3\tSMF initiated SM Policy Association Modification for UE reporting URSP update result\nWhen the UE reports the result of URSP rule update, the following enhancements are applicable to clause 4.16.5.1 (SM Policy Association Modification procedure):\nIn addition to step 4 in clause 4.16.5.1 if the PCF for the PDU Session receives the \"UE Policy\" Policy Control Request Trigger and associated UE Policy Container, steps 4a to 4b below are executed:\n-\tStep 4a: The PCF for the PDU Session determines that a UE Policy association has been already established towards the PCF for the UE for the SM Policy Association as described in clause 4.11.0a.2a.7.\n-\tStep 4b: The PCF for the PDU Session forwards the UE Policy Container to the PCF for the UE in Npcf_UEPolicyControl_Update Request.\n4.11.0a.2a.3\tPCF initiated SM Policy Association Modification\nFor the purpose of URSP delivery in EPS, PCF initiated SM Policy Association Modification procedure is triggered by an interaction from the PCF for the UE.\nThe following enhancements are applicable to clause 4.16.5.2 (PCF initiated SM Policy Association Modification procedure):\n-\tStep 4: The PCF for the PDU Session may receive a UE Policy Container from the PCF for the UE and/or an update in the Policy Control Request Triggers applicable to the UE as described in clause 4.11.0a.2a.6:\n-\tIf a UE Policy Container is received from the PCF for the UE, the PCF for the PDU Session selects one of the ongoing PDU Sessions for this UE that supports URSP Rule delivery in EPS according to clause 4.11.0a.2a.1 and includes that UE Policy Container in Npcf_SMPolicyControl_UpdateNotify request.\nIf an update in the Policy Control Request Triggers applicable to the UE is received, the PCF for the PDU Session determines whether an update on the current Policy Control Request Triggers needs to be sent to the SMF+PGW-C in Npcf_SMPolicyControl_UpdateNotify request.\n4.11.0a.2a.4\tVoid\n4.11.0a.2a.5\tUE Policy Association establishment\nTo support the delivery of URSP rule in EPS as described in clause 6.1.2.2.3 of TS 23.503 [20], the PCF for the PDU Session may establish a UE Policy Association towards the PCF for the UE.\nThis procedure may be triggered by the following procedures:\n1.\tUE requested bearer resource modification.\n2.\t5GS to EPS handover or 5GS to EPS Idle Mode mobility.\nFigure 4.11.0a.2a.5-1: UE Policy Association establishment procedure\nIn the non-roaming case, the V-PCF for the UE is not involved, and the PCF for the PDU Session interacts with the PCF for the UE. For the Home Routed roaming scenario, the V-PCF for the UE is not involved and the H-PCF for the PDU Session interacts with the H-PCF for the UE. For the LBO roaming scenario, the V-PCF for the PDU Session interacts with the V-PCF for the UE and the V-PCF for the UE interacts with the H-PCF for the UE.\nThe procedure is based on clause 4.16.11.1 for a UE in 5GC with the following differences:\n1.\tThe PCF for the PDU Session determines the need of establishment of a UE Policy Association when:\n-\tA UE Policy Container is received from the UE during SM Policy Association Update at UE requested bearer resource modification as described in clause 4.11.0a.2a.2.1; or\n-\tDuring 5GS to EPS mobility as described in clause 4.11.0a.2a.2.2.\n2.\tSame as step 2 in clause 4.16.11, with the following exceptions:\nThe PCF for the PDU Session includes the UE Policy Container in case of SM Policy Association update at UE requested bearer resource modification or 5GS to EPS Mobility indication in case of SM Policy Association update at 5GS to EPS mobility.\nFor LBO roaming the V-PCF for the PDU Session discovers and selects an instance of the V-PCF for the UE based on the available PCF instances obtained from the NRF or locally configured information in the V-PCF, depending on operator's policies, as described in clause 6.3.7.1 of TS 23.501 [2]. The V-PCF for the PDU Session contacts the V-PCF for the UE and steps 3 and 4 are executed.\nFor non-roaming or Home Routed roaming the (H-)PCF for the PDU Session contacts the (H-)PCF for the UE and step5 follows.\n3.\tSame as step 3 in clause 4.16.11.1, with the following exceptions:\nThe UE Policy Container is received at SM Policy Association instead of initial registration. When the UE Policy Association is being established due to 5GS to EPS mobility as described in clause 4.11.0a.2a.2.2, the V-PCF for the UE in the VPLMN needs to discover and select the same H-PCF for the UE that is serving the UE in the H-PLMN for 5GS by querying the BSF in the HPLMN. This is to be able to recover the information about the list of PSIs in the UE and the subscribed PCRTs from former UE Policy Association for the UE in 5GS as described in step 6. Therefore, the V-PCF for the UE in the VPLMN needs first to discover the BSF in the HPLMN.\nNOTE 1:\tFor Home Routed roaming, the V-PCF for the UE is not involved, therefore in this roaming scenario it is not possible to retrieve the Application guidance on URSP Rule for inbound roamers of the PLMN and provide it to the H-PCF for the UE to be used as input for the generation of the URSP rules for the UE as described in clause 6.6.2.2.3 of TS 23.503 [20].\n4.\tSame as in clause 4.16.11.1.\n5.\tSame as in clause 4.16.11.1 step 5, with the following exceptions:\nThe subscription to notification of N1 message delivery of policy information to the UE using Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageSubscribe service is not applicable.\n6.\tThe Same as step 6 in clause 4.16.11.1, with the following difference:\nIf \"5GS to EPS Mobility\" indication was received in Npcf_UEPolicyControl_Create in step 2 instead, the (H-)PCF recovers the information about the list of PSIs for the UE, the subscribed PCRTs in 5GS from former UE Policy Association for the UE and the indication about the support of provisioning of URSP rules in EPS. If the UE does not support the provisioning of URSPs in EPS, the H-PCF rejects the establishment of the UE Policy Association.\nNOTE 2:\tIn LBO roaming the V-PCF for the UE may trigger the establishment of the UE Policy Association for a UE that does not support the provisioning of URSP in EPS, as described in step 4a in clause 4.11.0a.2a.2.2.\nThe (H-)PCF provides the UE Policy Container in the Npcf_UEPolicyControl_UpdateNotify Request.\n7.\tSame as in clause 4.16.11.\nNOTE 3:\tSteps 8 and 9 are executed only in LBO roaming scenario.\n8.\tThe V-PCF for the UE forwards the UE Policy Container to the V-PCF for the PDU Session by invoking Npcf_UEPolicyControl_UpdateNotify Request.

The (H-) PCF checks whether the UE Policy Association for the UE is established for a UE in EPS by checking the RAT-Type of the UE Policy Association and in this case the (H-)PCF may send the UE Policy Container in the Npcf_UEPolicyControl_UpdateNotify Request. The (H-)PCF may provide updated PCRTs over the UE policy association.\nFor Home Routed roaming, the V-PCF for the UE is not involved, therefore the Service Parameters provided by the AF from the VPLMN are not used by the H-PCF as input for the generation of the URSP rules.\nNOTE:\tSteps 5 and 6 are executed only in LBO roaming.\n-\tStep 5: In case the UE Policy Association is for a UE in EPS, the (V-) PCF for the UE provides the UE Policy Container and/or policy control triggers to the (V-) PCF for the PDU Session.\n-\tStep 6: The (V-) PCF for the PDU session sends a response to the (V-) PCF for the UE.\n-\tSteps 7, 8 and 9 are replaced by steps 10-13 of procedure UE Policy Association Establishment in EPS from clause 4.11.0a.2a.5.\n4.11.0a.2a.7\tUE Policy Association Modification initiated by the PCF for the PDU Session\nThis procedure addresses the scenario where a Policy Control Request Trigger condition is met by the PCF for the PDU Session.\nThe procedure is based on the one defined in clause 4.16.12.1.1 with the following differences:\nIn the non-roaming case, the V-PCF is not involved, the AMF is replaced by the PCF for the PDU Session, and the role of the H-PCF is performed by the PCF for the UE.\nFor the Home Routed roaming scenarios, the V-PCF is not involved, the AMF is replaced by the H-PCF for the PDU Session, and the role of the H-PCF is performed by the H-PCF for the UE.\nFor the LBO roaming scenarios, the AMF is replaced by the V-PCF for the PDU Session, the role of the V-PCF is performed by the V-PCF for the UE and the role of the H-PCF is performed by the H-PCF for the UE.\n-\tStep 1: Same as in clause 4.16.12.1.1 step 1, with the following exceptions:\nIn LBO roaming the V-PCF for the PDU Session contacts the V-PCF for the UE and steps 2 and 3 are executed.

Based on UE Policy Association Modification initiated by the PCF for the UE in 4.11.0a.2a.6 and PCF initiated SM Policy Association Modification in 4.11.0a.2a.3, the updated URSP Rule included UE Policy Container is received by SMF+PGW-C. The SMF+PGW-C transfers the received UE Policy Container via ePCO to the UE by initiating the bearer modification without QoS update procedure as described in clause 5.4.3 of TS 23.401 [13].\nFigure 4.11.0a.2a.10-1: UE Policy Container delivery via EPS procedure\n0.\tPCF for the UE decides to update UE policy.\n1.\tThe PCF for the UE creates the UE Policy Container including UE policy information, selects one of the ongoing UE Policy Associations for the UE in EPS in case more than one exists and sends the UE Policy Container in the Npcf_UEPolicyControl_UpdateNotify Request over the selected UE Policy Association as described in step 3 of clause 4.11.0a.2a.6. If the PCF for the UE has not subscribed to be notified by the PCF for the PDU Session, the PCF for the UE subscribes to the PCF for the PDU Session to be notified about the UE response to an update of UE policy information by including \"Result of UE Policy Container delivery via EPS\" PCRT in this message. If the AF requested to PCF for the UE to report on the outcome of the UE Policies delivery as specified in clause 4.15.6.7, \"Result of UE Policy Container delivery via EPS\" PCRT shall be included in this message.\n2.\tThe PCF for the PDU Session sends a response to the PCF for the UE.\n3.\tThe PCF for the PDU Session initiates SM Policy Association Modification procedure as described in step 4 of clause 4.11.0a.2a.3. The PCF for the PDU Session transfers the UE Policy Container by Npcf_SMPolicyControl_UpdateNotify Request for the selected PDN connection for the related UE in EPC. If the PCF for the PDU Session received \"Result of UE Policy Container delivery via EPS\" PCRT in step 1, the PCF for the PDU Session subscribes to the SMF+PGW-C with \"Result of UE Policy Container delivery via EPS\" PCRT.\n4.\tThe SMF+PGW-C sends a response to the PCF for the PDU Session.\n5.\tThe SMF+PGW-C initiates the bearer modification without bearer QoS update procedure, as described in clause 5.4.3 of TS 23.401 [3]. The UE includes the result of UE Policy delivery in response via ePCO.\nNOTE:\tThe ePCO container for UE Policy delivery response is specified by Stage 3.\n6.\tThe SMF+PGW-C transparently forwards the response of the UE to the PCF for the PDU Session by using Npcf_SMPolicyControl_Update Request. The message includes the indication that \"Result of UE Policy Container delivery via EPS\" PCRT was met.\nIf the SMF+PGW-C received rejection (e.g. due to paging failure) from Update Bearer Request message in step 5, then the SMF+PGW-C sends the delivery failure result with an appropriate reason (e.g. such that UE is temporarily not reachable) and the indication of \"Result of UE Policy Container delivery via EPS\" PCRT was met to the PCF for the PDU Session.\n7.\tThe PCF for the PDU Session transparently forwards the response from the UE, or the delivery failure result provided by SMF+PGW-C to the PCF for the UE by using Npcf_UEPolicyControl_Update Request. The message includes the indication of \"Result of UE Policy Container delivery via EPS\" PCRT was met.\nIf the AF requested to PCF for the UE to report on the outcome of the UE Policies delivery as specified in clause 4.15.6.7, the PCF for the UE reports the outcome of the UE Policies delivery to the AF with the received result from the PCF for the PDU Session.\n8.\tThe PCF for the UE sends a response to the PCF for the PDU Session.\n9.\tThe PCF for the PDU Session sends a response to the SMF+PGW-C.\n4.11.0a.3\tMobility Restrictions\nThe UE's subscription may include access restriction for NR in 5GS and restriction for Core Network Type (5GC). If so, the HSS provides these restrictions to the MME. The MME includes these restrictions in the Handover Restriction List to the E-UTRAN. The MME and E-UTRAN use these restrictions to determine if mobility of the UE to 5GS or NR connected to 5GS should be permitted.\n4.11.0a.4\tPGW Selection\nWhen the UE requests to establish a non-emergency PDN connection to an APN, the MME may use the UE's support for 5GC NAS indication included in the UE Network Capability and/or UE's subscription from HSS that includes UE's mobility restriction parameters related to 5GS and/or indication of support for interworking with 5GS for this APN to determine if SMF+PGW-C or a standalone PGW-C should be selected. If both PGW-C and SMF+PGW-C is available, then MME may select SMF+PGW-C when UE's subscription from HSS indicate support for interworking with 5GS for the APN.\nNOTE:\tIf restriction for Core Network Type indicates that the UE can access to 5GC, it implies that the UE has 5G subscription data.\nWhen the UE performs emergency attach or requests to establish an emergency PDN connection, the MME may use the UE's support for 5GC NAS indication included in the UE Network Capability and/or local configuration to determine if an emergency SMF+PGW-C or a standalone emergency PGW-C should be selected. An emergency SMF+PGW-C needs to be configured in Emergency Configuration Data in the MME if it is to be selected.\nTo enable a differentiation of the emergency gateway based on UE´s support of 5GC NAS, the Emergency Configuration Data in the MME defined in TS 23.401 [13] is extended with the IE listed in Table 4.11.0a.4-1.\nTable 4.11.0a.4-1: MME Emergency Configuration Data Extensions\nField\nDescription\nEmergency SMF+PGW-C identity\nThe statically configured identity of a combined SMF+PGW-C used for emergency APN. The SMF+PGW-C identity may be either an FQDN or an IP address. (NOTE)\nNOTE:\tThe FQDN always resolves to one SMF+PGW-C.\n4.11.0a.5\tPDN Connection Establishment\nDuring establishment of non-emergency PDN connection in the EPC, the UE and the SMF+PGW-C exchange information via PCO as described in clause 5.15.7 of TS 23.501 [2]. For UE with 5GC NAS capability disabled (i.e. N1 mode is disabled), the UE may also allocate a PDU Session ID and send it to the SMF+PGW-C via PCO. If the SMF+PGW-C supports more than one S-NSSAI and the APN is valid for more than one S-NSSAI, before the SMF+PGW-C provides an S-NSSAI to the UE, the SMF+PGW-C should check such that the selected S-NSSAI is among the UE's subscribed S-NSSAIs which supports interworking with EPC and that the S-NSSAI is not subject to Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization, by retrieving the Subscribed S-NSSAI from UDM using the Nudm_SDM_Get service operation (the SMF+PGW-C discovers and selects a UDM as described in clause 6.3.8 of TS 23.501 [2]). If the SMF+PGW-C is in a VPLMN, the SMF+PGW-C uses the Nnssf_NSSelection_Get service operation to retrieve a mapping of the Subscribed S-NSSAIs to Serving PLMN S-NSSAI values. If the S-NSSAIs supported by the SMF+PGW-C are all subject to NSSAA, then the SMF+PGW-C should reject the PDN connection establishment. If the selected S-NSSAI is subject to NSAC and EPS counting is required for the S-NSSAI, the SMF+PGW-C uses the Nnsacf_NSAC_NumberOfUEsUpdate services operation and/or the Nnsacf_NSAC_NumberOfPDUsUpdate services operation to check if the selected S-NSSAI is available as described in clause 4.11.5.9. The SMF+PGW-C uses the Nudm_SDM_Subscribe service operation to subscribe the change of the Session Management Subscription data. If the SMF+PGW-C is notified from UDM with subscription data change, the SMF+ PGW-C takes actions for the PDN connection as described in clause 5.17.2.1 of TS 23.501 [2].\nAs described in TS 23.548 [74], during establishment of a PDN connection, a UE that hosts EEC(s) may indicate to the SMF+PGW-C, in the PCO, that it supports the ability to receive ECS address(es) via NAS and to transfer the ECS Address(es) to the EEC(s). If the UE indicated in the PCO that it supports the ability to receive ECS address(es) via NAS, the SMF+PGW-C may provide the ECS Address Configuration Information (as described in clause 6.5.2 of TS 23.548 [74]) to the UE in the PCO. The SMF+PGW-C may derive the Edge Configuration Server Information based on local configuration, the UE's location and/or UE subscription information.\nThe SMF+PGW-C may use the bearer modification procedure without bearer QoS update to send the UE a PCO with updated ECS Address Configuration Information as defined in clause 6.5.2 of TS 23.548 [74] to the UE.\nDuring establishment of non-emergency PDN connection in the EPC, if PGW-C+SMF is selected for a UE that has 5GS subscription, the SMF may be configured to obtain the subscribed IP index from UDM as part of subscription data using the Nudm_SDM_Get service operation (the PGW-C+SMF discovers and selects a UDM as described in clause 6.3.8 of TS 23.501 [2]).\nDuring establishment of non-emergency PDN connection in EPC, if PGW-C+SMF is selected for a UE that has 5GS subscription, the SMF may be configured to obtain the subscribed User Plane Security Policy from UDM as part of subscription data using the Nudm_SDM_Get service operation (the PGW-C+SMF discovers and selects a UDM as described in clause 6.3.8 of TS 23.501 [2]). The SMF uses the subscribed User Plane Security Policy as described in clause 5.10.3 of TS 23.501 [2].\nDuring establishment of non-emergency PDN connection in the EPC, if SMF+PGW-C is selected for a UE that has 5GS subscription but does not support 5GC NAS and is accessing via EPC/E-UTRAN and if the SMF+PGW-C supports more than one S-NSSAI and the APN is valid for more than one S-NSSAI, the SMF+PGW-C+PGW-C may proceed as specified in first paragraph of this clause or select any S-NSSAI associated with the APN of the PDN connection. The SMF+PGW-C shall not provide any 5GS related parameters to the UE.\nNOTE 1:\tThe SMF+PGW-C knows that the UE does not support 5GS NAS if the UE does not provide PDU Session ID in PCO (see clause 5.15.7 of TS 23.501 [2]).\nDuring establishment of emergency PDN connection:\n-\tThe SMF+PGW-C is to be derived from the emergency APN or to be statically configured in the Emergency Configuration Data in MME.\n-\t5GC interworking support with N26 or without N26 is determined based on UE's 5G NAS capability and local configuration (in the Emergency Configuration Data in MME).\n-\tThe S-NSSAI configured for the emergency APN in SMF+PGW-C is not sent to the UE by the SMF+PGW-C. One S-NSSAI is configured for the emergency APN.\nDuring establishment of non-emergency PDN connection and emergency PDN connection, if SMF+PGW-C is selected for a UE that does not support 5GC NAS, the SMF+PGW-C creates unique PDU Session ID for each PDN connection of the UE.\n-\tThe unique PDU Session ID can be created based on the EPS Bearer IDs assigned by the MME for the PDN Connections associated with the UE and not be in the range of PDU Session ID values that can be created by a 5GC NAS capable UE.\n-\tIf handover between EPS and EPC/ePDG (as specified in clause 8.6 of TS 23.402 [26]) is required, the SMF+PGW-C, based on operator configuration, may perform the following to ensure the uniqueness of PDU Session ID:\n-\tthe SMF+PGW-C queries the UDM for any PDU Session ID(s) that are already registered in the UDM for the UE by invoking Nudm_UECM_Get service operation.\n-\tthe SMF+PGW-C creates a PDU session ID that does not collide with the received PDU session ID(s).\n-\tWhen the SMF+PGW-C establishes the PDN connection successfully, the SMF+PGW-C performs UDM registration using the Nudm_UECM_Registration service operation.\nNOTE 2:\tIf the scenario that a UE handovers a PDN connection with APN1 established via MME to ePDG and then establishes a second PDN connection with APN2 via MME needs to be supported in a given deployment, then, based on operator configuration, the SMF+PGW-C can query the UDM to avoid that the same PDU Session ID value of first PDN connection would be assigned by the SMF+PGW-C for the second PDN connection.\nWhen the SMF+PGW-C establishes the PDN connection successfully, the SMF+PGW-C provides the ID of the PCF ID selected for the PDN connection in the UDM using the Nudm_UECM_Registration service operation.\nA SMF+PGW-C may support L2TP as described in clause 4.3.2.4. In this case step 1 and step 7 of Figure 4.3.2.4‑1 correspond to a PDN Connection establishment and a SMF+PGW-C replaces the SMF in that Figure.\nTo support User Plane Integrity Protection with EPS and policies that Require User Plane integrity protection to be used, at PDN connection establishment, the MME shall indicate to the SMF+PGW-C (via the Serving GW) whether the UE, the current eNB and the MME support User Plane Integrity Protection in EPS. If the MME and the UE support User Plane Integrity Protection, then the SMF+PGW-C informs the MME of the User Plane integrity protection policy (Required, Preferred, Not Needed) applicable to the PDN connection on a per-EPS bearer basis. In turn, the MME informs the eNB.\nTo support URSP Provisioning in EPS, during Initial Attach with default PDN connection establishment procedure in EPS, the UE provides the \"Indication of URSP Provisioning Support in EPS\" in the PCO or in the ePCO in the PDN connectivity request as described in clause 5.17.8 of TS 23.501 [2]. If the SMF+PGW-C supports URSP Provisioning in EPS and the ePCO capability, it provides the \"Indication of URSP Provisioning Support in EPS\" in the ePCO in the Create Session Response. If the UE receives the \"Indication of URSP Provisioning Support in EPS\" in the  ePCO from SMF+PGW-C provided in the PDN Connectivity Accept message, the UE initiates the UE requested bearer resource modification procedure and includes the UE Policy Container in the ePCO in the Request Bearer Resource Modification message, see clause 4.11.0a.10. If the default PDN connection is not established during Initial Attach procedure, the aforementioned procedure happens during the first request for PDN connectivity. If the negotiation of the support of URSP provisioning in EPS fails for the first PDN connection the UE may retry the aforementioned procedure successively for the next PDN connectivity requests until it succeeds for one of them as specified in clause 5.17.8 of TS 23.501 [2] When the UE receives an indication of URSP provisioning support in EPS in the PDN Connectivity Accept message or in PDU Session Establishment Accept (as described in clause 4.11.5.3) and this PDN connection or the corresponding transferred PDN connection after 5GS to EPS handover is not released, then for any subsequent PDN connectivity requests the UE does not include an indication of URSP Provisioning Support in EPS.\n4.11.0a.6\tNetwork Configuration\nTo avoid the need for identifier coordination between MMEs, AMFs and SGSNs, the MME provides to the eNB its served GUMMEIs by separating the values between native MME GUMMEI values, values mapped from AMF and values mapped from SGSN.\n4.11.0a.7\tInteractions with DN-AAA Server\nEAP-based secondary authentication and authorization at PDU Session establishment is supported as defined in clause 4.3.2.3. EAP-based secondary authentication and authorization at PDN connection establishment is supported as defined in Annex H.\nThis clause 4.11.0a.7 defines the support of secondary authorization over EPS without EAP-based authentication when one of the UE, the 5GC and the DN does not support (or is configured not to use) the mechanisms defined in Annex H.\nNOTE 1:\tThis implies that when data connectivity to the DN is initiated as a PDU Session over 5GC it can be subject to EAP based secondary authentication mechanism (see TS 33.501 [15]) whereas, when data connectivity to the same DN is initiated as a PDN connection over EPC it cannot be subject to EAP based secondary authentication mechanism. This discrepancy occurs regardless of whether the data connection is later on moved between EPC and 5GC.\nNOTE 2:\tSecondary authorization without authentication means no signalling exchange with the UE.\nIf secondary authentication and authorization has been performed for the PDU Session while the UE was in 5GS and the UE has moved to EPS, the following applies:\n-\tDN-AAA re-authorization (without re-authentication signalling) can be performed even when the UE is in EPS, e.g. to provide new parameters from the DN-AAA Server to SMF+PGW-C.\n-\tRe-authentication cannot be performed while the UE is in EPS because there is no support of the related signalling in EPS. In case the SMF+PGW-C receives a re-authentication request from the DN-AAA, the SMF+PGW-C informs the DN-AAA Server that the UE is not available for re-authentication at the moment. The SMF+PGW-C should not initiate PDN connection release at this point: the DN-AAA decides the actions to take, based on the reply from SMF+PGW-C and local policy which may also trigger a DN-AAA Server request to release the PDU Session/PDN connection of the UE.\n4.11.0a.8\t5GC NAS capability (re-)enabled and disabled\nWhen 5G NAS (i.e. N1 mode) capability is (re-)enabled, the UE triggers Tracking Area Update procedure as specified in clause 5.3.3.0 of TS 23.401 [13].\nIf the MME determines that interworking with 5GS is changed to Supported and if the MME has selected a standalone PGW, the MME may initiate PDN disconnection with reactivation required as specified in clause 5.10.3 of TS 23.401 [13] at the end of the tracking area update procedure.\nNOTE 1:\tMME requesting PDN disconnection with reactivation required is to allow MME to select a SMF+PGW-C so that session continuity can be achieved when UE moves to 5GS.\nIf a UE disables its support of N1 mode and moves from 5GS to EPS, the UE and the SMF+PGW-C maintain the mapped 5GS parameters for PDU session(s) that are transferred to EPS.\nNOTE 2:\tThe mapped 5GS parameters are used when the UE re-enables N1 mode and moves back to 5GS.\n4.11.0a.9\tPDN Connection Release\nIf the SMF+PGW-C has registered with the UDM, the SMF+PGW-C shall deregister with UDM (using Nudm_UECM_Deregistration) during the PDN Connection Release procedure.\nNOTE:\tSMF+PGW-C registration in the UDM is specified in clause 4.11.0a.5 or clause 4.3.2.\n4.11.0a.10\tUE requested bearer resource modification procedure\nTo support URSP Provisioning in EPS, the following enhancement to clause 5.4.5 of TS 23.401 [13] applies:\n-\tSteps 1, if the UE received the Indication of URSP Provisioning Support in EPS in ePCO from SMF+PGW-C in the PDN Connectivity Accept message (as described in clause 4.11.0a.5), the UE includes the UE Policy Container ePCO in the Request Bearer Resource Modification message.\n-\tStep 4 (replaced by SM Policy Association Modification procedure as described in clause 4.11.0a.2a.2.1), SMF+PGW-C forwards the UE Policy Container received from the UE to the PCF for the PDU Session, which triggers UE Policy Association establishment as specified in clause 4.11.0a.2a.5.\n4.11.0a.11\tSMF+PGW-C initiated bearer modification without bearer QoS update\nTo support URSP Provisioning in EPS, the following enhancement to clause 5.4.3 of TS 23.401 [13] applies:\n-\tStep 1 The PCF provides UE Policy Container, which is received from the PCF for the UE as specified in clause 4.11.0a.2a.6, to the SMF+PGW-C in (PCF-initiated) IP-CAN Session Modification procedure as specified in clause 4.11.0a.3.\n-\tSteps 2~5 The UE Policy Container in ePCO is sent by the SMF+PGW-C to the UE via SGW and MME\n-\tSteps 6~9 The UE sends UE Policy delivery result to the SMF+PGW-C via MME and SGW.\n-\tSteps 10 The SMF+PGW-C reports the UE Policy delivery result to the PCF as specified in clause 4.11.0a.2a.2.3.",

      "content": "N26 interface is used to provide seamless session continuity for single registration mode UE.\nInterworking between EPS and 5GS is supported with IP address preservation by assuming SSC mode 1. Interworking between EPS and 5GS is not supported for PDU Sessions with SSC mode 2 or SSC mode 3.\nWhen the UE is served by the 5GC, during PDU Session establishment and GBR QoS Flow establishment, SMF+PGW-C performs EPS QoS mappings, from the 5G QoS parameters obtained from the PCF and allocates TFT with the PCC rules obtained from the PCF if PCC is deployed. Otherwise, EPS QoS mappings and TFT allocation are mapped by the SMF+PGW-C locally. The PGW+SMF ignores 5G QoS parameters that are not applicable to EPC (e.g. QoS Notification control). If a TFT is to be allocated for a downlink unidirectional EPS bearer mapped from a downlink only QoS Flow, the SMF+PGW-C shall allocate a TFT packet filter that effectively disallows any useful uplink packet as specified in TS 23.401 [13]. EPS Bearer IDs are allocated by the serving AMF requested by the SMF if the SMF determines that EPS Bearer IDs need to be assigned to the QoS Flows. For each PDU Session, EPS bearer IDs are allocated to the default EPS bearer and dedicated bearers. The SMF shall be able to determine the QoS flows that require EPS Bearer IDs, based on the QoS profile and operator policies.\nNOTE 1:\tBased on operator policies, an SMF can map all non-GBR QoS flows to default EPS bearer in which case it requests only one EBI for all the non-GBR QoS flows. Alternatively, an SMF can also map one non-GBR QoS flow to one dedicated EPS bearer in which case it requests a dedicated EBI for non-GBR QoS flow that should be mapped to dedicated EPS bearer. In between these two extreme cases, the SMF can also map more than one (but not all) non-GBR QoS Flow to the same EPS bearer (either default EPS bearer or dedicated EPS bearer).\nNOTE 2:\tTo reduce the probability of AMF revoking the EBI corresponding to the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule, ARP priority level of dedicated QoS Flows can be set to higher value than that of the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule within the same PDU Session.\nWhen a new QoS Flow needs to be mapped to an EPS Bearer ID that has already been assigned for an existing QoS Flow, the SMF includes the already assigned EPS Bearer ID in the QoS Flow description sent to the UE.\nIf there is a possibility to run into a restriction regarding the number of TFT packet filters that can be allocated for the PDU Session,\n-\tin the case that PCC is deployed, the PCF may include in the PCC rules the Precedence for TFT packet filter allocation parameter, which determines the order of the PCC rules in allocation of TFT packet filter(s) by the SMF+PGW-C.\n-\tin the case that PCC is deployed but the Precedence for TFT packet filter allocation parameter is not received, or in the case that PCC is not deployed, the SMF+PGW-C makes the decision how to allocate TFT packet filter(s) based on operator policy or implementation.\nNOTE 3:\tAn EPS bearer can have up to 16 TFT packet filters.\nFor Ethernet and Unstructured PDU Session Types, only EPS Bearer ID for the default EPS Bearer is allocated. The EPS Bearer IDs for these EPS bearers are provided to the SMF+PGW-C by the AMF and are provided to the UE and NG-RAN by the SMF+PGW-C using N1 SM NAS message and N2 SM message. The UE is also provided with the mapped QoS parameters. The UE and the SMF+PGW-C store the association between the QoS Flow and the corresponding EBI and the EPS QoS parameters. When the QoS Flow is deleted e.g. due to PDU Session status synchronization or PDU Session Modification, the UE and the SMF+PGW-C delete any possibly existing EPS QoS parameters associated with the deleted QoS Flow.\nIn this release, for a PDU Session for a LADN or for Multi-homed IPv6 PDU Session, the SMF doesn't allocate any EBI or mapped QoS parameters.\nFor PDU Sessions with UP integrity protection of UP Security Enforcement Information set to Required, the SMF does not allocate any EBI or mapped QoS parameters unless the UE support User Plane Integrity Protection with EPS and the AMF supports the associated functionality.\nIf the UE supports User Plane Integrity Protection with EPS, as indicated in the S1 UE network capability and the AMF supports the related functionality, the AMF indicates the UE support for EPS User Plane Integrity Protection to SMF. Then, for PDU Sessions with UP integrity protection of UP Security Enforcement Information set to Required, the SMF may perform the EPS bearer ID allocation procedure as described in clause 4.11.1.4.\nIf the MME indicates support for EPS User Plane Integrity Protection to SMF+PGW-C, the SMF+PGW-C provides User Plane Security Enforcement Information for the EPS bearer contexts to the MME (via the SGW).\nWhen the UE is served by the EPC, during PDN connection establishment, the UE allocates the PDU Session ID and sends it to the SMF+PGW-C via PCO. During PDN Connection establishment and dedicated bearer establishment, SMF+PGW-C performs EPS QoS mappings, from the 5G QoS parameters obtained from the PCF and allocates TFT with the PCC rules obtained from the PCF if PCC is deployed. Otherwise, EPS QoS mappings and TFT allocation are mapped by the SMF+PGW-C locally. Other 5G QoS parameters corresponding to the PDN connection, e.g. Session AMBR and QoS rules and QoS Flow level QoS parameters if needed for the QoS Flow(s) associated with the QoS rule(s), are sent to UE in PCO. The UE and the SMF+PGW-C store the association between the EPS Context and the PDU Session Context to use it in the case of handover from EPS to 5GS. During the EPS bearer establishment/modification procedure, QoS rules corresponding to the related EPS bearers are allocated and sent to UE in PCO. The 5G QoS parameters are stored in the UE and are to be used when the UE is handed over from EPS to the 5GS. The 5G QoS parameters may be provided to SMF+PGW-C by the PCF, if PCC is deployed. On mobility from EPS to 5GS, the UE sets the SSC mode of the mapped PDU Session to SSC mode 1. The UE and the SMF+PGW-C store the association between the EPS bearer and the corresponding 5G QoS Rules and QoS Flow level QoS parameters if needed for the QoS Flow(s) associated with the QoS rule(s). When the EPS bearer is deleted e.g. due to EPS bearer status synchronization or bearer deactivation, the UE and the SMF+PGW-C delete any possibly existing 5G QoS Rule(s) and QoS Flow level QoS parameters if any for the QoS Flow(s) associated with the QoS rule(s) associated with the deleted EPS bearer.\nIn the roaming case, if the VPLMN supports interworking with N26, the UE shall operate in Single Registration mode.\nDuring the 5GS-EPS handover, indirect forwarding may apply for the downlink data forwarding performed as part of the handover. From its configuration data the AMF knows whether indirect forwarding applies and it requests to allocate downlink data forwarding paths on UPFs for indirect forwarding. From its configuration data the MME knows whether indirect forwarding applies and it requests to allocate downlink data forwarding paths on Serving GWs for indirect forwarding. It is configured on AMF and MME whether indirect downlink data forwarding does not apply, applies always or applies only for inter PLMN inter RAT handovers.\nDuring the 5GS-EPS handover, direct forwarding may apply for the downlink data forwarding performed as part of the handover. From its configuration data the source RAN node knows whether direct forwarding applies and indicates to source CN the direct data forwarding is available.\nDuring 5GS-EPS handover, on the target side, the CN informs the target RAN node whether data forwarding is possible or not.\nDuring interworking from EPS to 5GS, as the SMF+PGW-C may have different IP addresses when being accessed over S5/S8 and N11/N16 respectively, the AMF shall discover the SMF instance by an NF/NF service discovery procedure using the FQDN for the S5/S8 interface received from the MME as a query parameter.\nThis is required for both non-roaming and roaming with local breakout, as well as for home routed roaming.\nNOTE 4:\tAs the AMF is not aware of the S-NSSAI assigned for the PDN Connection, the NF/NF service discovery used to find the SMF instance can use PLMN level NRF.\nDuring interworking from 5GS to EPS, for QoS Flows without EPS bearer ID(s) assigned or for QoS Flows with PCC rules that do not have allocated TFT packet filters, the SMF+PGW-C deletes the PCC rules associated with those QoS Flows and informs the PCF about the removed PCC rule(s).\nDuring interworking from 5GS to EPS, as a PDU Session may be released while the UE is served by EPS, if Small Data Rate Control is used the SMF+PGW-C obtains the Small Data Rate Control Status from the PGW-U+UPF in the N4 Session Modification procedure or from the SCEF+NEF and passes the Small Data Rate Control Status in the PDU Session Context Response to the AMF, for the AMF to store. The time to store the Small Data Rate Control Statuses is implementation specific. If the UE and PGW-U+UPF / SCEF+NEF have stored APN Rate Control parameters and optionally APN Rate Control Status they are only applied when the UE is served by EPS.\nDuring interworking from 5GS to EPS, for PDU Sessions with UP integrity protection of UP Security Enforcement Information set to Required, the SMF+PGW-C does not provide the EPS bearer context unless both the UE, the target eNB and the target MME support User Plane Integrity Protection with EPS.\nDuring interworking from EPS to 5GS the UE and PGW-U+UPF / SCEF+NEF store the APN Rate Control parameters and APN Rate Control Status while the UE is served by 5GS, so they can be used if the UE moves back to EPS.\nAt EPS to 5GS mobility:\n-\tThe UE considers the PDN connections released if those PDN connections were established over EPS and for which the UE has not received mapped 5GS QoS parameters from the network.\nNOTE 5:\tUE not receiving mapped 5GS QoS parameters from the network covers the case that a UE did not provide a PDU Session ID to the network when establishing a PDN connection while UE's N1 mode is disabled and the case that a UE provided PDU Session ID where the network (SMF+PGW-C) does not provide mapped 5GS parameters.\n-\tThe MME does not transfer to 5GS a PDN connection that does not support 5GS interworking, e.g. PDN connection was established on a stand-alone PGW, or 5GS interworking is restricted by subscription data.",

      "content": "Figure 4.11.1.2.1-1 describes the handover procedure from 5GS to EPS when N26 is supported.\nIn the case of handover to a shared EPS network, the source NG-RAN determines a PLMN to be used in the target network as specified by TS 23.501 [2]. The source NG-RAN shall indicate the selected PLMN ID to be used in the target network to the AMF as part of the TAI sent in the HO Required message.\nIn the case of handover from a shared NG-RAN, the AMF may provide the MME with an indication that the 5GS PLMN is a preferred PLMN at later change of the UE to a 5GS shared networks.\nDuring the handover procedure, as specified in clause 4.9.1.3.1, the source AMF shall reject any SMF+PGW-C initiated N2 request received since handover procedure started and shall include an indication that the request has been temporarily rejected due to handover procedure in progress.\nUpon reception of a rejection for an SMF+PGW-C initiated N2 request(s) with an indication that the request has been temporarily rejected due to handover procedure in progress, the SMF+PGW-C behaves as specified in TS 23.401 [13].\nFigure 4.11.1.2.1-1: 5GS to EPS handover for single-registration mode with N26 interface\nThe procedure involves a handover to EPC and setup of default EPS bearer and dedicated bearers for QoS Flows that have EBI assigned, in EPC in steps 1-16 and re-activation, if required, of dedicated EPS bearers for non-GBR QoS Flows that have no EBI assigned, in step 19. This procedure can be triggered, for example, due to new radio conditions, load balancing or in the presence of QoS Flow for normal voice or IMS emergency voice, the source NG-RAN node may trigger handover to EPC.\nFor Ethernet and Unstructured PDU Session Types, the PDN Type Ethernet and non-IP respectively are used, when supported, in EPS.\nWhen EPS supports PDN Type non-IP but not PDN type Ethernet, PDN type non-IP is used also for Ethernet PDU sessions. The SMF shall also set the PDN Type of the EPS Bearer Context to non-IP in this case. After the handover to EPS, the PDN Connection will have PDN Type non-IP, but it shall be locally associated in UE and SMF to PDU Session Type Ethernet or Unstructured respectively.\nIn the roaming home routed case, the SMF+PGW-C always provides the EPS Bearer ID and the mapped QoS parameters to UE. The V-SMF caches the EPS Bearer ID and the mapped QoS parameters obtained from H-SMF for this PDU session. This also applies in the case that the HPLMN operates the interworking procedure without N26.\nNOTE 1:\tThe IP address preservation cannot be supported, if SMF+PGW-C in the HPLMN doesn't provide the mapped QoS parameters.\n1.\tNG-RAN decides that the UE should be handed over to the E-UTRAN. If NG-RAN is configured to perform Inter RAT mobility due to IMS voice fallback triggered by QoS flow setup and request to setup QoS flow for IMS voice was received, NG-RAN responds indicating rejection of the QoS flow establishment because of mobility due to fallback for IMS voice via N2 SM information and triggers handover to E-UTRAN. The NG-RAN sends a Handover Required (Target eNB ID, Direct Forwarding Path Availability, Source to Target Transparent Container, inter system handover indication) message to the AMF. NG-RAN indicates bearers corresponding to the 5G QoS Flows for data forwarding in Source to Target Transparent Container.\nIf the source NG RAN and target E-UTRAN support RACS as defined in TS 23.501 [2], the Source to Target transparent container need not carry the UE radio access capabilities (instead the UE Radio Capability ID is supplied from the CN to the target E-UTRAN). However, if the source NG-RAN has knowledge that the target E-UTRAN might not have a local copy of the Radio Capability corresponding to the UE Radio Capability ID (i.e. because the source NG-RAN had itself to retrieve the UE's Radio Capability from the AMF) then the source NG-RAN may also send some (or all) of the UE's Radio Capability to the target E-UTRAN (the size limit based on configuration). In the case of inter-PLMN handover, when the source NG-RAN and target E-UTRAN support RACS as defined in TS 23.501 [2] and TS 23.401 [13] and the source NG-RAN determines that the target PLMN does not support the UE Radio Capability ID assigned by the source PLMN based on local configuration, then the source NG-RAN includes the UE radio access capabilities in the Source to Target transparent container.\nDirect Forwarding Path Availability indicates whether direct forwarding is available from the NG-RAN to the E-UTRAN. This indication from NG-RAN can be based on e.g. the presence of IP connectivity and security association(s) between the NG-RAN and the E-UTRAN.\nIf the handover is triggered due to Emergency fallback, the NG-RAN may forward the Emergency indication to the target eNB in the Source to Target Transparent Container and the target eNB allocates radio bearer resources taking received indication into account.\n2a-2c.\tThe AMF determines from the 'Target eNB Identifier' IE that the type of handover is Handover to E-UTRAN. The AMF selects an MME as described in clause 4.3.8.3 of TS 23.401 [13].\nThe AMF determines for a PDU Session whether to retrieve context including mapped UE EPS PDN Connection from the V-SMF (in the case of HR roaming) or the SMF+PGW-C (in the case of non roaming or LBO roaming) as follows:\n-\tIf the AMF determines that one or more of the EBI(s) can be transferred, the AMF sends Nsmf_PDUSession_ContextRequest to the V-SMF or SMF+PGW-C and includes in the message EBI value(s) if any that cannot be transferred.\n-\tThe EBI values(s) that cannot be transferred is determined by the AMF if the target MME does not support 15 EPS bearers, i.e. the AMF determines the EBI values in range 1-4 as not to be transferred to EPS and if there are still more than 8 EBI values associated with PDU Sessions, the AMF then determines EBI value(s) not to be transferred to EPS based on S-NSSAI and ARP as specified in clause 5.17.2.2.1 of TS 23.501 [2].\n-\tThe AMF does not retrieve the context for a PDU Session that cannot be transferred to EPS due to no EBI allocated, or allocated EBIs not transferrable, or combination of the two.\nWhen the AMF sends Nsmf_PDUSession_ContextRequest the AMF provides also the target MME capability to the V-SMF or the SMF+PGW-C to allow it to determine whether to include EPS Bearer context for Ethernet PDN Type or non-IP PDN Type or not.\nWhen the AMF sends Nsmf_PDUSession_ContextRequest to the V-SMF or the SMF+PGW-C, the AMF indicates whether the target MME supports User Plane Integrity Protection with EPS.\nNOTE 2:\tThe AMF knows the MME capability to support 15 EPS bearers, Ethernet PDN type and/or non-IP PDN type or not through local configuration. The AMF knows the MME capability to support User Plane integrity protection through local configuration but the actual EPS support may depend on the target E-UTRAN coverage (see step 14).\nWhen Nsmf_PDUSession_Context Request is received in the V-SMF or the SMF+PGW-C, the V-SMF or the SMF+PGW-C provides context that includes the mapped EPS PDN Connection as follows:\n-\tIf there is EBI list not to be transferred and the EBI value of the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS Rule is included in that list, the V-SMF or the SMF+PGW-C shall not return the PDN Connection context (which implies the whole PDU Session is not transferred to EPS), otherwise if the EBI value of the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS Rule is not included in EBI list not to be transferred, the V-SMF or PGW C+SMF shall not provide the EPS bearer context(s) mapped from QoS Flow(s) associated with the EBI list not to be transferred.\n-\tFor PDU Sessions with PDU Session Type Ethernet, if the UE and target MME supports Ethernet PDN type, the V-SMF or the PGW C+SMF provides Context for Ethernet PDN Type, otherwise if the target MME does not support Ethernet Type but support non-IP Type, the V-SMF or the PGW C+SMF provides Context for non-IP PDN Type. For PDU Sessions with PDU Session Type Unstructured, the V-SMF or the SMF+PGW-C provides Context for non-IP PDN Type.\n-\tIf the UP integrity protection policy for the EPS bearer context is set to \"Required\", the V-SMF or the PGW C+SMF shall not provide the EPS bearer context unless the MME capability indicates support for User Plane Integrity Protection with EPS and the UE supports User Plane Integrity Protection with EPS.\nIn the case of non roaming or LBO roaming, when Nsmf_PDUSession_ContextRequest is received in PGW C+SMF, if the SMF+PGW-C determines that EPS Bearer Context can be transferred to EPS and the CN Tunnel Info for EPS bearer(s) have not been allocated before, the SMF+PGW-C sends N4 Session modification to the PGW-U+UPF to establish the CN tunnel for each EPS bearer and provides EPS Bearer Contexts to AMF, as described in step 8 of clause 4.11.1.4.1. The PGW-U+UPF is ready to receive the uplink packet from E-UTRAN.\nThis step is performed with all the SMF+PGW-Cs corresponding to PDU Sessions of the UE which are associated with 3GPP access and have at least one EBI(s) determined to be transferred to EPS.\nNOTE 3:\tThe AMF knows the MME capability to support 15 EPS bearers, Ethernet PDN type and/or non-IP PDN type or not through local configuration.\nIn home routed roaming scenario, the UE's EPS PDN Contexts are obtained from the V-SMF. If Small Data Rate Control applies on PDU Session, the V-SMF retrieves the SM Context, including Small Rate Control Status information from the H-SMF using Nsmf_PDUSession_Context Request.\n3.\tThe AMF sends a Forward Relocation Request as in step 3 in clause 5.5.1.2.2 (S1-based handover, normal) in TS 23.401 [13], with the following modifications and clarifications:\n-\tParameter \"Return preferred\" may be included. Return preferred is an optional indication by the MME of a preferred return of the UE to the 5GS PLMN at a later access change to a 5GS shared network. An MME may use this information as specified by TS 23.501 [2].\n-\tThe SGW address and TEID for both the control-plane or EPS bearers in the message are such that target MME selects a new SGW.\n-\tThe AMF determines, based on configuration and the Direct Forwarding Path Availability, the Direct Forwarding Flag to inform the target MME whether direct data forwarding is applicable.\n-\tThe AMF includes the mapped SM EPS UE Contexts for PDU Sessions with and without active UP connections.\n-\tSubject to operator policy if the secondary RAT access restriction condition is the same for EPS and 5GS, the AMF may set EPS secondary RAT access restriction condition based on the UE's subscription data.\n4-5.\tStep 4 and 4a respectively in clause 5.5.1.2.2 (S1-based handover, normal) in TS 23.401 [13].\n6.\tStep 5 (Handover Request) in clause 5.5.1.2.2 (S1-based handover, normal) in TS 23.401 [13] with the following modification:\n-\tHandover Request may contain information Handover Restriction List with information about PLMN IDs as specified by clause 5.2a of TS 23.251 [35] for eNodeB functions.\n-\tThe target eNB should establish E-RABs indicated by the list of EPS bearer to be setup provided by the MME, even if they are not included in the source to target container.\n7-9.\tStep 5a through 7 in clause 5.5.1.2.2 (S1-based handover, normal) in TS 23.401 [13].\n10a.\tIf data forwarding applies, the AMF sends the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request (data forwarding information) to the SMF+PGW-C. If multiple SMF+PGW-Cs serves the UE, the AMF maps the EPS bearers for Data forwarding to the SMF+PGW-C address(es) based on the association between the EPS bearer ID(s) and PDU Session ID(s). In home-routed roaming case, the AMF requests the V-SMF to create indirect forwarding tunnel if indirect forwarding applies.\n10b.\tIf indirect data forwarding applies, the SMF+PGW-C may select an intermediate PGW-U+UPF for data forwarding. The SMF+PGW-C maps the EPS bearers for Data forwarding to the 5G QoS flows based on the association between the EPS bearer ID(s) and QFI(s) for the QoS flow(s) in the SMF+PGW-C and then sends the QFIs, Serving GW Address(es) and TEID(s) for data forwarding to the PGW-U+UPF. The CN Tunnel Info is provided by the PGW-U+UPF to SMF+PGW-C in this response. In home-routed roaming case, the V-SMF selects the V-UPF for data forwarding.\nThe SMF+PGW-C deactivates PDU Set based handling at PGW-U+UPF if it is activated during the UE was registered to 5GS as described in clause 5.37.5.3 of TS 23.501 [2].\n10c.\tThe SMF+PGW-C returns an Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response (Cause, Data Forwarding tunnel Info, QoS flows for Data Forwarding). Based on the correlation between QFI(s) and Serving GW Address(es) and TEID(s) for data forwarding, the PGW-U+UPF maps the QoS flow(s) into the data forwarding tunnel(s) in EPC.\n11.\tThe AMF sends the Handover Command to the source NG-RAN (Transparent container (radio aspect parameters that the target eNB has set-up in the preparation phase), Data forwarding tunnel info, QoS flows for Data Forwarding). The source NG-RAN commands the UE to handover to the target Access Network by sending the HO Command. The UE correlates the ongoing QoS Flows with the indicated EPS Bearer IDs to be setup in the HO command. The UE locally deletes the PDU Session if the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule in the PDU Session does not have an EPS Bearer ID assigned. If the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule has an EPS Bearer ID assigned, the UE keeps the PDU Session (PDN connection) and for the remaining QoS Flow(s) that do not have EPS bearer ID(s) assigned, the UE locally deletes the QoS rule(s) and the QoS Flow level QoS parameters if any associated with those QoS Flow(s) and notifies the impacted applications that the dedicated QoS resource has been released. The UE deletes any UE derived QoS rules. The EPS Bearer ID that was assigned for the QoS flow of the default QoS rule in the PDU Session becomes the EPS Bearer ID of the default bearer in the corresponding PDN connection.\nIf indirect data forwarding is applied, Data forwarding tunnel info includes CN tunnel info for data forwarding per PDU session. For the QoS Flows indicated in the \"QoS Flows for Data Forwarding\", NG-RAN initiate data forwarding via to the PGW-U+UPF based on the CN Tunnel Info for Data Forwarding per PDU Session. Then the PGW-U+UPF maps data received from the data forwarding tunnel(s) in the 5GS to the data forwarding tunnel(s) in EPS and sends the data to the target eNodeB via the Serving GW.\nIf direct data forwarding is applied, Data forwarding tunnel info includes E-UTRAN tunnel info for data forwarding per EPS bearer. NG-RAN initiate data forwarding to the target E-UTRAN based on the Data Forwarding Tunnel Info for Data Forwarding per EPS bearer.\n12-12c.\tStep 13 to step 14 from clause 5.5.1.2.2 (S1-based handover, normal) in TS 23.401 [13] with the following clarification:\n-\tThe AMF requests the release of the PDU Session which is associated with 3GPP access and not expected to be transferred to EPC, i.e. the AMF requests the release of:\n-\tPDU Session(s) whose corresponding SMF+PGW-C(s) are not contacted by AMF for SM context because the AMF determines that none of EBI(s) for the PDU Session can be transferred to EPS at step 2a; and\n-\tPDU Session(s) for which the SM context retrieval failed at step 2c.\n12d.\tThe AMF acknowledges MME with Relocation Complete Ack message. A timer in AMF is started to supervise when resource in NG-RAN shall be released.\n12e.\tIn the case of home routed roaming, the AMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_ReleaseSMContext Request (V-SMF only indication) to the V-SMF. This service operation request the V-SMF to remove only the SM context in V-SMF, i.e. not release PDU Session context in the SMF+PGW-C.\nThe V-SMF starts a timer and releases the SM context on expiry of the timer.\n13.\tStep 15 from clause 5.5.1.2.2 (S1-based handover, normal) in TS 23.401 [13].\n14a.\tStep 16 (Modify Bearer Request) from clause 5.5.1.2.2 (S1-based handover, normal) in TS 23.401 [13] with the following clarification:\n-\tIf the PDU Session (PDN connection) has QoS Flows that do not have EPS bearer ID(s) assigned, or QoS Flow(s) for which the mapped EPS bearers are not included in Modify Bearer Request, the SMF+PGW-C deletes the PCC rule(s) associated with those QoS Flows and informs the PCF about the removed PCC rule(s). If there are QoS Flow(s) with PCC rule(s) that do not have allocated TFT packet filters, the SMF+PGW-C deletes those PCC rule(s) and informs the PCF about the removed PCC rule(s).\nNOTE 4:\tIf the QoS flow is deleted, the IP flows of the deleted QoS rules will continue flowing on the default EPS bearer if it does not have an assigned TFT. If the default EPS bearer has an assigned TFT, the IP flows of the deleted QoS Flow may be interrupted until step 19 when dedicated bearer activation is triggered by a request from the PCF.\nThe SMF+PGW-C may need to report some subscribed event to the PCF by performing an SMF initiated SM Policy Association Modification procedure as defined in clause 4.16.5.\nIf the MME does not indicate support of User Plane integrity protection, or the new eNB does not support User Plane integrity protection, or the UE does not support User Plane Integrity Protection with EPS and the UP integrity protection policy is set to \"Required\" then the SMF+PGW-C releases the bearers associated with the PDN CONNECTION.\n15.\tThe SMF+PGW-C initiates a N4 Session Modification procedure towards the UPF+PGW-U to update the User Plane path, i.e. the downlink User Plane for the indicated PDU Session is switched to E-UTRAN. The SMF+PGW-C releases the resource of the CN tunnel for PDU Session in UPF+PGW-U.\n16.\tStep 16a (Modify Bearer Response) from clause 5.5.1.2.2 (S1-based handover, normal) in TS 23.401 [13]. At this stage the User Plane path is established for the default bearer and the dedicated EPS bearers between the UE, target eNodeB, Serving GW and the PGW-U+UPF. The SMF+PGW-C uses the EPS QoS parameters as assigned for the dedicated EPS bearers during the QoS Flow establishment. SMF+PGW-C maps all the other IP flows to the default EPS bearer (see NOTE 4).\nIf indirect forwarding tunnel(s) were previously established, the SMF+PGW-C starts a timer, to be used to release the resource used for indirect data forwarding.\n17.\tStep 17 from clause 5.5.1.2.2 (S1-based handover, normal) in TS 23.401 [13].\n18.\tThe UE initiates a Tracking Area Update procedure as specified in step 18 of clause 5.5.1.2.2 (S1-based handover, normal) in TS 23.401 [13].\nThis includes the deregistration of the old AMF for 3GPP access from the HSS+UDM as specified in clause 4.11.1.5.3. Any registration associated with the non-3GPP access in the old AMF is not removed (i.e. an AMF that was serving the UE over both 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses does not consider the UE as deregistered over non 3GPP access and will remain registered and subscribed to subscription data updates in UDM).\nNOTE 5:\tThe behaviour whereby the HSS+UDM cancels location of CN node of the another type, i.e. AMF, is similar to HSS behaviour for MME and Gn/Gp SGSN registration (see TS 23.401 [13]). The target AMF that receives the cancel location from the HSS+UDM is the one associated with 3GPP access.\nWhen the UE decides to deregister over non-3GPP access or the old AMF decides not to maintain a UE registration for non-3GPP access anymore, the old AMF then deregisters from UDM by sending a Nudm_UECM_Deregistration service operation, unsubscribes from Subscription Data updates by sending an Nudm_SDM_Unsubscribe service operation to UDM and releases all the AMF and AN resources related to the UE.\n19.\tIf PCC is deployed, the PCF may decide to provide the previously removed PCC rules to the SMF+PGW-C again thus triggering the SMF+PGW-C to initiate dedicated bearer activation procedure. This procedure is specified in clause 5.4.1 of TS 23.401 [13] with modification captured in clause 4.11.1.5.4. This step is applicable for PDN Type IP or Ethernet, but not for non-IP PDN Type.\n20.\tStep 21 from clause 5.5.1.2.2 (S1-based handover, normal) in TS 23.401 [13].\n21.\tIn the case of home routed roaming, at the expiry of the timer at V-SMF started at step 12e, the V-SMF locally releases the SM context and the UP resource for the PDU Session including the resources used for indirect forwarding tunnel(s) that were allocated at step 10.\nIn non-roaming or local breakout roaming, if SMF+PGW-C has started a timer in step 16, at the expiry of the timer, the SMF+PGW-C sends N4 Session Modification Request to PGW-U+UPF to release the resources used for the indirect forwarding tunnel(s) that were allocated at step 10.\nWhen the timer set in step 12d expires, AMF also sends a UE Context Release Command message to the source NG RAN. The source NG RAN releases its resources related to the UE and responds with a UE Context Release Complete message.",

      "content": "4.11.1.2.2.1\tGeneral\nN26 interface is used to provide seamless session continuity for single registration mode.\nThe procedure involves a handover to 5GS and setup of QoS Flows in 5GS.\nIn the home routed roaming case, the PGW-C+ SMF in the HPLMN always receives the PDU Session ID from UE and provides PDN Connection associated 5G QoS parameter(s) and S-NSSAI to the UE. This also applies in the case that the HPLMN operates the interworking procedure without N26.\nIn the case of handover to a shared 5GS network, the source E-UTRAN determines a PLMN to be used in the target network as specified by clause 5.2a of TS 23.251 [35] for eNodeB functions. A supporting MME may provide the AMF via N26 with an indication that source EPS PLMN is a preferred PLMN when that PLMN is available at later change of the UE to an EPS shared network.\nNOTE 1:\tIf the UE has active EPS bearer for normal voice or IMS emergency voice, the source E-UTRAN can be configured to not trigger any handover to 5GS.\nIf the PDN Type of a PDN Connection in EPS is non-IP and is locally associated in UE and SMF to PDU Session Type Ethernet or Unstructured, the PDU Session Type in 5GS shall be set to Ethernet or Unstructured respectively.\nNOTE 2:\tIf the non-IP PDN Type is locally associated in UE and SMF to PDU Session Type Ethernet, it means that Ethernet PDN Type is not supported in EPS.\nNOTE 3:\tThe IP address continuity can't be supported, if SMF+PGW-C in the HPLMN doesn't provide the mapped QoS parameters.\nIn order to support the E-UTRAN NTN enhancements defined in TS 36.300 [46], for handover from EPS to 5GS, the following applies related to handling of UE's radio capabilities:\n-\tIf the target NG-RAN node knows (e.g. by configuration) that the UE's E-UTRA radio capabilities applicable to the target NG-RAN node may be different to the E-UTRA radio capabilities stored in the source eNodeB (e.g. for handover from an eNodeB that supports the NTN enhancements as defined in TS 36.300 [46]), then the target NG-RAN node shall trigger retrieval of the E-UTRA radio capability information again from the UE.\nIn order to support the E-UTRAN NTN enhancements defined in TS 36.300 [46], for handover from 5GS to EPS, the following applies related to handling of UE's radio capabilities:\n-\tIf the target eNodeB node knows (e.g. by configuration) that the UE's E-UTRA radio capabilities applicable to the target eNodeB may be different to the E-UTRA radio capabilities stored in the source NG-RAN node (e.g. for handover to eNodeB that supports the NTN enhancements as defined in TS 36.300 [46]), then the target eNodeB shall trigger retrieval of the E-UTRA radio capability information again from the UE.\n4.11.1.2.2.2\tPreparation phase\nFigure 4.11.1.2.2.2-1 shows the preparation phase of the Single Registration-based Interworking from EPS to 5GS procedure.\nFigure 4.11.1.2.2.2-1: EPS to 5GS handover using N26 interface, preparation phase\nThis procedure applies to the Non-Roaming (TS 23.501 [2] Figure 4.3.1-1), Home-routed roaming (TS 23.501 [2] Figure 4.3.2-1) and Local Breakout roaming Local Breakout (TS 23.501 [2] Figure 4.3.2-2) cases.\n-\tFor non-roaming scenario, V-SMF, v-UPF and v-PCF are not present\n-\tFor home-routed roaming scenario, the SMF+PGW-C and UPF+PGW-U are in the HPLMN. v-PCF are not present\n-\tFor local breakout roaming scenario, V-SMF and v-UPF are not present. SMF+PGW-C and UPF+PGW-U are in the VPLMN.\nIn local-breakout roaming case, the v-PCF interacts wit the SMF+PGW-C.\n1 - 2.\tStep 1 - 2 from clause 5.5.1.2.2 (S1-based handover, normal) in TS 23.401 [13].\n3.\tStep 3 from clause 5.5.1.2.2 (S1-based handover, normal) in TS 23.401 [13] with the following modifications:\nAn additional optional parameter Return preferred. Return preferred is an optional indication provided by the MME to indicate a preferred return of the UE to the last used EPS PLMN at a later access change to an EPS shared network. Based on the Return Preferred indication, the initial AMF may store the last used EPS PLMN ID in the UE Context.\nThe initial AMF converts the received EPS MM Context into the 5GS MM Context. This includes converting the EPS security context into a mapped 5G security context as described in TS 33.501 [15]. The MME UE context includes IMSI, ME Identity, UE security context, UE Network Capability and EPS Bearer context(s) and may also include LTE-M Indication. The MME EPS Bearer context(s) include for each EPS PDN connection the IP address and FQDN for the S5/S8 interface of the SMF+PGW-C and APN and for each EPS bearer the IP address and CN Tunnel Info at the UPF+PGW-U for uplink traffic. If the AMF received the LTE-M indication in the EPS MM Context, then it considers that the RAT Type is LTE-M.\nThe initial AMF queries the (PLMN level) NRF in serving PLMN by issuing the Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request including the FQDN for the S5/S8 interface of the SMF+PGW-C and the NRF provides the IP address or FQDN of the N11/N16 interface of the SMF+PGW-C.\nIf the initial AMF cannot retrieve the address of the corresponding SMF for a PDN connection, it will not move the PDN connection to 5GS.\nNOTE 1:\tIf the initial AMF holds a native 5G security context for the UE, the initial AMF may activate this native 5G security context by initiating a NAS SMC upon completing the handover procedure.\n4.\tThe initial AMF invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext service operation (UE EPS PDN Connection, initial AMF ID, data Forwarding information, Target ID) on the SMF identified by the SMF+PGW-C address and indicates HO Preparation Indication (to avoid switching the UP path). The initial AMF ID uniquely identifies the initial AMF serving the UE. This step is performed for each PDN Connection and the corresponding SMF+PGW-C address/ID in the UE context the initial AMF received in step 3. The SMF finds the corresponding PDU Session based on EPS Bearer Context(s).\nBased on configuration and the Direct Forwarding Flag received from the MME, the initial AMF determines the applicability of data forwarding and indicates to the SMF whether the direct data forwarding or indirect data forwarding is applicable.\nTarget ID corresponds to Target ID provided by the MME in step 3.\nFor home-routed roaming scenario, the initial AMF selects a default V-SMF per PDU Session and invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext service operation (UE PDN Connection Contexts, initial AMF ID, SMF + PGW-C address, S-NSSAI). The S-NSSAI is the S-NSSAI configured in initial AMF for interworking, which is associated with default V-SMF.\nThe default V-SMF selects the SMF+PGW-C using the received H-SMF address as received from the initial AMF and initiates a Nsmf_PDUSession_Create service operation with the SMF+PGW-C and indicates HO Preparation Indication. The V-SMF provides the QoS constraints of the VPLMN to the H-SMF.\nStep 5 and step 6 are skipped if the SMF+PGW-C (H-SMF+PGW-C in the case of home-routed scenario) determines that session continuity from EPS to 5GS is not supported for the PDU Session (e.g. PDU Session ID was not received for the PDN connection in EPS, or PDU Session ID was received but mapped 5GS parameters were not provided to the UE due to 5GC interworking restricted).\n5.\tIf dynamic PCC is deployed, the SMF+ PGW-C (H-SMF for home-routed scenario) may initiate SMF initiated SM Policy Modification towards the PCF.\n6.\tThe SMF+PGW-C requests the PGW-U+UPF to allocate the CN Tunnel Info for PDU Session. The SMF+PGW-C send N4 Session modification to PGW-U+UPF to establish the CN tunnel for PDU Session at PGW-U+UPF. The PGW-U+UPF is ready to receive the uplink packets from NG-RAN. The PGW-U+UPF allocates the PGW-U CN Tunnel Info for PDU Session and sends it to the SMF+PGW-C. This step is performed at all SMF+PGW-Cs allocated to the UE for each PDU Session of the UE.\n7.\tThe SMF+PGW-C (default V-SMF in the case of home-routed roaming scenario only) sends a Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Response (PDU Session ID, S-NSSAI, allocated EBIs, N2 SM Information (QoS Profile(s), EPS Bearer Setup List, Mapping between EBI(s) and QFI(s), CN Tunnel-Info, cause code)) to the initial AMF.\nFor home-routed roaming scenario the step 8 need be executed first. The CN Tunnel-Info provided to the initial AMF in N2 SM Information is the V-CN Tunnel-Info.\nThe SMF includes mapping between EBI(s) and QFI(s) as part of N2 SM Information container. If the P-GW-C+SMF (H-SMF in the case of home-routed scenario) determines that seamless session continuity from EPS to 5GS is not supported for the PDU Session (e.g. PDU Session ID was not received for the PDN connection in EPS), then it does not provide SM information for the corresponding PDU Session but includes the appropriate cause code for rejecting the PDU Session transfer within the N2 SM Information and release the PDN connection locally in the SMF+PGW-C. If neither indirect forwarding nor direct forwarding is applicable, the SMF shall further include a \"Data forwarding not possible\" indication in the N2 SM information container. If SMF is indicated that Direct Forwarding is applicable in step 4, the SMF shall further include a \"Direct Forwarding Path Availability\" indication in the N2 SM information container. In home routed roaming case, the S-NSSAI included in N2 SM Information container is the S-NSSAI received in step 4.\nThe initial AMF stores an association of the PDU Session ID, S-NSSAI and the SMF ID. The AMF stores also the allocated EBI(s) associated to the PDU Session ID.\nIf the PDN Type of a PDN Connection in EPS is non-IP and is locally associated in SMF to PDU Session Type Ethernet, the PDU Session Type in 5GS shall be set to Ethernet. If the PDN type of a PDN Connection in EPS is non-IP and is locally associated in UE and SMF to PDU Session Type Unstructured, the PDU Session Type in 5GS shall be set to Unstructured.\nNOTE 2:\tIf the non-IP PDN Type is locally associated in SMF to PDU Session Type Ethernet, it means that Ethernet PDN Type is not supported in EPS.\nIn the case of PDU Session Type Ethernet, that was using PDN type non-IP in EPS, the SMF creates QoS rules and QoS Flow level QoS parameters for the QoS Flow(s) associated with the QoS rule(s) based on the PCC Rules received from PCF.\nIn the case of home-routed roaming scenario, the V-SMF may apply VPLMN policies as described in TS 23.501 [2], clause 5.17.1.3.\nThe SMF includes the User Plane Security Policy as part of N2 SM Information container. The SMF determines the User Plane Security Policy as described in clause 5.10.3 of TS 23.501 [2].\n8.\tFor home-routed roaming scenario only: The default V-SMF selects a default v-UPF and initiates an N4 Session Establishment procedure with the selected default v-UPF. The default V-SMF provides the default v-UPF with packet detection, enforcement and reporting rules to be installed on the UPF for this PDU Session, including H-CN Tunnel Info.\nThe default v-UPF acknowledges by sending an N4 Session Establishment Response message. The V-CN Tunnel Info is allocated by the v-UPF and provided to the default V-SMF in this step.\n8a.\tBased on the received S-NSSAI from the SMF+PGW-C, the Initial AMF may reselect a target AMF as described in clause 5.15.5.2.1 of TS 23.501 [2] and invokes Namf_Communication_RelocateUEContext request (SUPI, Target 5GAN Node ID, PDU session ID and the S-NSSAI associated with N2 SM Information received in step 7, Source to Target Transparent Container, 5GS MM Context, MME Tunnel Endpoint Identifier for Control Plane, MME Address for Control plane, PDU Session ID and its associated S-NSSAI of the VPLMN value for each PDU Session, the corresponding S-NSSAI of HPLMN value for home routed PDU Session(s), SMF+PGW-C ID of each PDU Session, default V-SMF ID and SM Context ID of each PDU Session, allocated EBIs of each PDU Session, Allowed NSSAI received from NSSF) to the selected target AMF.\nNOTE 3:\tWhen there is no need of AMF reallocation, then the target AMF in following steps is the same as the initial AMF.\nNOTE 4:\tIn the case of Home routed PDU Session the S-NSSAI associated with N2 SM information used in steps 8, 8a and 9 is the S-NSSAI configured for interworking in the initial AMF. Otherwise the S-NSSAI received from the SMF in step 7 can be used in steps 8, 8a and 9 for the S-NSSAI associated with N2 SM information.\n9.\tThe target AMF sends a Handover Request (Source to Target Transparent Container, Allowed NSSAI, PDU session ID and the S-NSSAI received from Source AMF associated with the corresponding N2 SM Information (QFI(s), QoS Profile(s), EPS Bearer Setup List, V-CN Tunnel Info, Mapping between EBI(s) and QFI(s)), Mobility Restriction List, UE Radio Capability ID) message to the NG-RAN.\nIf available, the target AMF provides NG-RAN with a PLMN list in the Mobility Restriction List containing at least the serving PLMN, which may also include the last used EPS PLMN ID if it is the preferred PLMN for subsequent mobility to EPS. See TS 38.413 [10], clause 9.3.1.85 for details about the Mobility Restriction List.\nNG-RAN can use the source to target transparent container and N2 SM Information container to determine which QoS flows have been proposed for forwarding and decide for which of those QoS flows it accepts the data forwarding or not.\nThe target AMF provides the UE Radio Capability ID to NG-RAN if RACS is supported. If the UE Radio Capability ID is included in the Handover Request message, when there is no corresponding UE radio capabilities set for UE Radio Capability ID at NG-RAN and no UE radio access capabilities are provided in the Source to Target transparent container, NG-RAN shall request the T-AMF to provide the UE radio capabilities set corresponding to UE Radio Capability ID to the NG-RAN. If the Source to Target transparent container contains the UE radio access capabilities and the T-RAN did not receive the UE Radio Capability ID from the T-AMF, NG-RAN shall proceed with handover using the received UE access radio capabilities. If the T-RAN received both the UE radio access capabilities and the UE Radio Capability ID, then the T-RAN shall use any locally stored UE radio access capability information corresponding to the UE Radio Capability ID. If none are stored locally, the T-RAN may request the full UE radio access capability information from the core network. If the full UE radio access capability information is not promptly received from the core network, or the T-RAN chooses not to request them, then the T-RAN shall proceed with the UE radio access capabilities sent by the source RAN node. The T-RAN shall not use the UE radio access capability information received from the source RAN node for any other UE with the same the UE Radio Capability ID.\n10.\tThe NG-RAN sends a Handover Request Acknowledge (Target to Source Transparent Container, List of PDU Sessions to Hand-over with N2 SM response (PDU Session ID, list of accepted QFI(s), AN Tunnel Info, Data Forwarding Tunnel Info), List of PDU Sessions that failed to be established with the failure cause given in the N2 SM information element, PDU Set Based Handling Support Indication included in the N2 SM information) message to the target AMF.\nIf indirect data forwarding is applied, the NG-RAN includes one assigned TEID/TNL address per PDU Session (for which there is at least one QoS flow for which it has accepted the forwarding) within the SM Info container. It also includes the list of QoS flows for which it has accepted the forwarding. According to the mapping between EBI(s) and QFI(s), if one EPS bearer in EPS is mapped to multiple QoS flows in 5GS, all such QoS flows need to be accepted to support indirect data forwarding during EPS to 5GS mobility. Otherwise, the NG RAN rejects the indirect data forwarding for the QoS flows which are mapped to the EPS bearer.\nIf direct data forwarding is applied, the NG-RAN includes one assigned TEID/TNL per E-RAB accepted for direct data forwarding.\nWhen the target NG-RAN rejects the handover with a Handover Failure, steps 11-13 and step 16 are not executed.\nThe NG-RAN includes the PDU Set Based Handling Support Indication in N2 SM information as described in clause 5.37.5.3 of TS 23.501 [2].\n11.\tThe target AMF sends an Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request (PDU Session ID, N2 SM response received from NG-RAN in step 10) message to the SMF for updating N3 tunnel information. In home routed roaming case, the Data Forwarding Tunnel Info is handled by the default V-SMF and will not be sent to the SMF+PGW-C.\n12.\tSMF+PGW-C (default V-SMF in home-routed roaming scenario) performs preparations for N2 Handover by indicating N3 UP address and Tunnel ID of NG-RAN to the UPF if N2 Handover is accepted by NG-RAN. If indirect data forwarding is applied, SMF+PGW-C indicates the mapping between the TEID where the UPF receives data forwarded by the source SGW and the QFI(s) and N3 Tunnel Info for data forwarding where the UPF is selected to forward such data (e.g. an intermediate UPF). If the EPS bearer is mapped to multiple QoS flows and an intermediate UPF is selected for data forwarding, only one QFI is selected by the SMF+PGW-C from QFIs corresponding to the QoS flows.\nIf indirect data forwarding is applied in home routed roaming case, the default V-SMF sends a default V-UPF for data forwarding the mapping between the TEID where the UPF receives data forwarded by the source SGW and the QFI and N3 Tunnel Info for data forwarding. If the EPS bearer is mapped to multiple QoS flows and an intermediate UPF is selected for data forwarding, only one QFI is selected by the SMF+PGW-C from QFIs corresponding to the QoS flows.\nIf N2 Handover is not accepted by NG-RAN, SMF+PGW-C deallocates N3 UP address and Tunnel ID of the selected UPF.\nThe EPS Bearer Setup list is a list of EPS bearer Identifiers successfully handover to 5GC, which is generated based on the list of accepted QFI(s).\nIf a PDU Session is rejected by the Target NG-RAN with an indication that the PDU session was rejected because User Plane Security Enforcement is not supported in the Target NG-RAN and the User Plane Enforcement Policy indicates \"Required\" as described in clause 5.10.3 of TS 23.501 [2], the SMF triggers the release of this PDU Session. In all other cases of PDU Session rejection, the SMF can decide whether to release the PDU Session or to deactivate the UP connection of this PDU Session.\nIf some of the QoS Flows of a PDU Session are not accepted by the Target NG-RAN, the SMF shall initiate the PDU Session Modification procedure to remove the non-accepted QoS Flows from the PDU Session(s) after the handover procedure is completed.\n13.\tSMF+PGW-C (default V-SMF in home-routed roaming scenario) to target AMF: Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response (PDU Session ID, EPS Bearer Setup List). The data forwarding information is included in the EPS Bearer Setup List. In home routed roaming case, the default V-SMF provides the tunnel information for data forwarding.\nThis message is sent for each received Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext_Request message.\n14.\tThe target AMF sends the message Forward Relocation Response (Cause, Target to Source Transparent Container, Serving GW change indication, EPS Bearer Setup List, target AMF Tunnel Endpoint Identifier for Control Plane, Addresses and TEIDs) to MME. The EPS Bearer Setup list is the combination of EPS Bearer Setup list from different SMF+PGW-C(s).\nIn the case of Handover Failure in step 10, the target AMF provides to the MME the failure related information such as the Target RAN to Source RAN Failure Information.\n15.\tThe target AMF invokes Namf_Communication_RelocateUEContext response (Cause) to the initial AMF if step 8a had been performed. The target AMF indicates whether the Relocate UE Context (hand-Over) succeeded or failed.\nIf the target NG RAN has rejected the Handover Request in step 10, the Namf_Communication_RelocateUEContext response indicates a failure due to RAN rejection. Then the initial AMF invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext request towards the SMF+PGW-C(s) contacted at step 4 indicating . The Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext request contains an indication that this is due to a handover rejected by the target RAN.\n16.\tStep 8 from clause 5.5.1.2.2 (S1-based handover, normal) in TS 23.401 [13] is executed if the source MME determines that indirect data forwarding applies.\nUpon completion of the handover procedure, based on the PDU Set Based Handling Support Indication received in step 10 as described in clause 5.37.5.3 of TS 23.501 [2], the SMF may initiate the PDU Session modification procedure to provide PDU Set QoS parameters to NG-RAN and configure the PSA UPF to activate/deactivate the PDU Set identification and marking for DL.\n4.11.1.2.2.3\tExecution phase\nFigure 4.11.1.2.2.3-1 shows the Single Registration-based Interworking from EPS to 5GS procedure.\nFigure 4.11.1.2.2.3-1: EPS to 5GS handover using N26 interface, execution phase\nNOTE:\tStep 6 P-GW-C+SMF Registration in the UDM is not shown in the figure for simplicity.\n1 - 2.\tStep 9 - 11 from clause 5.5.1.2.2 (S1-based handover, normal) in TS 23.401 [13]. Different from step 9a of clause 5.5.1.2.2 (S1-based handover, normal) in TS 23.401 [13], upon reception of Handover Command, the UE will keep the QoS Flow context for which it did not receive the corresponding radio resources in the NG-RAN until the QoS Flow is released by the network using PDU Session Modification procedure in clause 4.3.3. If the QoS Flow with a default QoS Rule of a PDU Session does not have the corresponding radio resources in the NG-RAN, UE considers that the user plane of this PDU Session is deactivated.\n3.\tHandover Confirm: the UE confirms handover to the NG-RAN.\nThe UE moves from the E-UTRAN and synchronizes with the target NG-RAN. The UE may resume the uplink transmission of user plane data only for those QFIs and Session IDs for which there are radio resources allocated in the NG-RAN.\nThe E-UTRAN sends DL data to the Data Forwarding address received in step 1. If the indirect data forwarding is applied, the E-UTRAN forward the DL data to NG-RAN via the SGW and the v-UPF. The v-UPF forwards the data packets to the NG-RAN using the N3 Tunnel Info for data forwarding, adding the QFI information. The target NG-RAN prioritizes the forwarded packets over the fresh packets for those QoS flows for which it had accepted data forwarding.\nIf Direct data forwarding is applied, the E-UTRAN forwards the DL data packets to the NG-RAN via the direct data forwarding tunnel.\n4.\tHandover Notify: the NG-RAN notifies to the target AMF that the UE is handed over to the NG-RAN.\n5.\tThen the target AMF knows that the UE has arrived to the target side and informs the MME by sending a Forward Relocation Complete Notification message.\n6.\tStep 14 from clause 5.5.1.2.2 (S1-based handover, normal) in TS 23.401 [13].\n7.\tTarget AMF to SMF +PGW-C (V-SMF in the case of roaming and Home-routed case): Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request (Handover Complete Indication for PDU Session ID). In the Home-routed roaming case, the V-SMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request (V-CN Tunnel Info, Handover Complete Indication) to SMF+PGW-C.\nHandover Complete Indication is sent per each PDU Session to the corresponding SMF +PGW-C (sent by V-SMF in the roaming and Home-routed case) to indicate the success of the N2 Handover.\nIf indirect forwarding is used, a timer in SMF+PGW-C (V-SMF in the case of roaming and Home-routed case) is started to supervise when resources in UPF (for indirect data forwarding) shall be released.\n8.\tThe SMF + PGW-C updates the UPF + PGW-U with the V-CN Tunnel Info, indicating that downlink User Plane for the indicated PDU Session is switched to NG-RAN or V-UPF in the case of roaming in Home-routed case and the CN tunnels for EPS bearers corresponding to the PDU session can be released.\nFor each EPS Bearer one or more \"end marker\" is sent to Serving GW by the UPF+PGW-U immediately after switching the path. The UPF + PGW-U starts sending downlink packets to the V-UPF.\n9.\tIf PCC infrastructure is used, the SMF + PGW-C informs the PCF about the change of, for example, the RAT type and UE location.\n10.\tSMF +PGW-C to target AMF: Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response (PDU Session ID).\nSMF +PGW-C confirms reception of Handover Complete.\n-\tIf the SMF has not yet registered for this PDU Session ID, then the SMF registers with the UDM using Nudm_UECM_Registration (SUPI, DNN, PDU Session ID) for a given PDU Session as in step 4 of PDU Session Establishment Procedure in clause 4.3.2.\n11.\tFor home-routed roaming scenario: The V-SMF provides to the v-UPF with the N3 DL AN Tunnel Info. This step is executed after step 7.\n12.\tThe UE performs the EPS to 5GS Mobility Registration Procedure from step 2 in clause 4.11.1.3.3. The UE includes the UE Policy Container containing the list of PSIs, indication of UE support for ANDSP and OSId if available. If the UE holds a native 5G-GUTI it also includes the native 5G-GUTI as an additional GUTI in the Registration Request. The UE shall select the 5G-GUTI for the additional GUTI as follows, listed in decreasing order of preference:\n-\ta native 5G-GUTI assigned by the PLMN to which the UE is attempting to register, if available;\n-\ta native 5G-GUTI assigned by an equivalent PLMN to the PLMN to which the UE is attempting to register, if available;\n-\ta native 5G-GUTI assigned by any other PLMN, if available.\nThe additional GUTI enables the target AMF to find the UE's 5G security context (if available). The target AMF provides NG-RAN with a PLMN list in the Handover Restriction List containing at least the serving PLMN, taking into account of the last used EPS PLMN ID and Return preferred indication as part of the Registration procedure execution and target AMF signalling to NG-RAN. The Handover Restriction List contains a list of PLMN IDs as specified by TS 23.501 [2].\n13.\tStep 19 from clause 5.5.1.2.2 (S1-based handover, normal) in TS 23.401 [13]. Step 20a - 20b from clause 5.5.1.2.2 (S1-based handover, normal) in TS 23.401 [13], with the following modification:\nFor the PDN connections that are not possible to be transferred to 5GS (e.g. PDN connections are anchored in a standalone PGW), the MME initiates PDN connection release procedure as specified in TS 23.401 [13].\n14.\tIf indirect forwarding was used, then the expiry of the timer started at step 7 triggers the SMF+PGW-C (V-SMF in the case of roaming and Home-routed case) to release temporary resources used for indirect forwarding that were allocated at steps 11 to 13 in clause 4.11.1.2.2.2.",

UE performs Tracking Area Update procedure in E-UTRA/EPS when it moves from NG-RAN/5GS to E-UTRA/EPS coverage area.\nThe procedure involves a Tracking Area Update to EPC and setup of default EPS bearer and dedicated bearers in EPC in steps 1-11 and re-activation, if required.\nFigure 4.11.1.3.2-1: 5GS to EPS Idle mode mobility using N26 interface\nThe TAU procedure in TS 23.401 [13] is used with the following 5GS interaction:\n1.\tStep 1 from clause 5.3.3.1 (Tracking Area Update procedure with Serving GW change) in TS 23.401 [13].\n2.\tStep 2 from clause 5.3.3.1 (Tracking Area Update procedure with Serving GW change) in TS 23.401 [13] with the modification captured in clause 4.11.1.5.3.\n3-4.\tSteps 3-4 from clause 5.3.3.1 (Tracking Area Update procedure with Serving GW change) in TS 23.401 [13].\n5a.\tThe AMF verifies the integrity of the TAU request message:\nThe AMF determines for a PDU Session whether to retrieve context including mapped UE EPS connection from V-SMF (in the case of HR roaming) or from the SMF+PGW-C (in the case of non roaming or LBO roaming) as follows:\n-\tIf the AMF determines that one or more of the EBI(s) can be transferred, the AMF sends Nsmf_PDUSession_ContextRequest to the V-SMF or SMF+PGW-C and includes in the message EBI value(s) if any that cannot be transferred.\n-\tThe EBI values(s) that cannot be transferred is determined by the AMF if the target MME does not support 15 EPS bearers, i.e. the AMF determines the EBI values in range 1-4 as not to be transferred to EPS and if there are still more than 8 EBI values associated with PDU Sessions, the AMF then determines EBI value(s) not to be transferred to EPS based on S-NSSAI and ARP as specified in clause 5.17.2.2.1 of TS 23.501 [2].\n-\tThe AMF does not retrieve the context for a PDU Session that cannot be transferred to EPS due to no EBI allocated, or allocated EBIs not transferrable, or combination of the two.\nIn non-roaming or LBO roaming, the AMF retrieves context that includes the mapped EPS Bearer Contexts.\n-\tThe AMF provides in Nsmf_PDUSession_ContextRequest the target MME capability to the PGW C+SMF in the request to allow the SMF+PGW-C to determine whether to include EPS Bearer context for Ethernet PDN type or non-IP PDN Type or not.\n-\tIf the AMF includes in Nsmf_PDUSession_ContextRequest EBI list not to be transferred and if the EBI value of the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS Rule is included in that list, the SMF+PGW-C shall not return the PDN Connection context (which implies the whole PDU Session is not transferred to EPS), otherwise if the EBI value of the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS Rule is not included in the EBI list not to be transferred, the V-SMF or SMF+PGW-C shall not provide the EPS bearer context(s) mapped from QoS Flow(s) associated with that list.\n-\tWhen the AMF sends Nsmf_PDUSession_ContextRequest to the V-SMF or the SMF+PGW-C, the AMF indicates whether the target MME supports User Plane Integrity Protection with EPS.\nThe above steps are performed with all the SMF+PGW-Cs corresponding to PDU Sessions of the UE which are associated with 3GPP access and have EBI(s) allocated to them.\nIn Home Routed roaming, the AMF requests the V-SMF to provide SMF Context by using Nsmf_PDUSession_ContextRequest.\nNOTE 1:\tThe AMF knows the MME capability to support 15 EPS bearers, support User Plane Integrity Protection with EPS, Ethernet PDN Type and/or non-IP PDN type or not through local configuration.\n5b.\tFor Non-roaming or roaming with local breakout scenario, if the CN Tunnel Info for EPS bearer(s) have not been allocated before, the SMF sends N4 Session Modification Request to PGW-U+UPF to establish the tunnel for each EPS bearers and PGW-U+UPF provides the PGW-U Tunnel Info for each EPS bearers to SMF+PGW-C.\nNOTE 2:\tIn home routed roaming case, the CN Tunnel Info for each EPS bearer has been prepared by the SMF+PGW-C and provided to the V-SMF as specified in clause 4.11.1.4.1.\n5c.\tFor PDU Sessions that are anchored a UPF, in non-roaming or roaming with local breakout, the SMF+PGW-C returns mapped EPS bearer contexts, which includes PGW-C control plane tunnel information of the PDN connection corresponding to the PDU session, EBI for each EPS bearer, PGW-U tunnel information for each EPS bearer and EPS QoS parameters for each EPS bearer. For PDU Sessions with PDU Session Type Ethernet, if the UE and target MME supports Ethernet PDN type, the SMF+PGW-C provides SM Context for Ethernet PDN Type, otherwise if the UE or target MME does not support Ethernet Type but support non-IP Type, the SMF+PGW-C provides SM Context for non-IP PDN Type. For PDU Sessions with PDU Session Type Unstructured, the SMF provides SM Context for non-IP PDN Type. In home routed roaming, V-SMF provides the SM Context.\nIf the UP integrity protection policy for the EPS bearer context is set to \"Required\", the V-SMF or the PGW C+SMF shall not provide the EPS bearer context unless the MME supports User Plane Integrity Protection with EPS and the UE supports User Plane Integrity Protection with EPS.\nFor PDU Sessions that are anchored at an NEF, the SMF returns an SCEF+NEF ID and an EBI for each PDN connection corresponding to a PDU Session.\nIf the SMF+PGW-C has marked that the status of one or more QoS Flows are deleted in the 5GC but not synchronized with the UE yet according to clause 4.3.3.2, the SMF+PGW-C does not return to the AMF the EPS context(s) if all its associated QoS Flows are marked as deleted, that is, the SMF+PGW-C returns to the AMF the EPS bearer contexts mapped from QoS Flows where at least one of the QoS Flow for the EPS bearer is not marked as deleted.\n6.\tThe AMF responds with a Context Response message as in step 5 in clause 5.3.3.1 of TS 23.401 [13] carrying mapped MM context (including mapped security context), Return preferred and SM EPS UE Context (default and dedicated GBR bearers) to the MME. If the verification of the integrity protection fails, the AMF returns an appropriate error cause. Return preferred is an optional indication by the AMF of a preferred return of the UE to the 5GS PLMN at a later access change to a 5GS shared network. The AMF may start an implementation specific (guard) timer for the UE context.\nFrom the received context and the Tracking Area indicated by the RAN, the MME can determine whether the UE is performing Inter-RAT mobility to or from NB-IoT.\n7 - 14.\tSteps 6-12 from clause 5.3.3.1 (Tracking Area Update procedure with Serving GW change) in TS 23.401 [13] are performed with following addition and modification:\nIn the step 10, if the PDU Session (PDN connection) has QoS Flows that do not have EPS bearer ID(s) assigned, the SMF+PGW-C deletes the PCC rule(s) associated with those QoS Flows and informs the PCF about the removed PCC rule(s). If there are QoS Flow(s) with PCC rule(s) that do not have allocated TFT packet filters (due to number exceeding limit), the SMF+PGW-C deletes those PCC rule(s) and informs the PCF about the removed PCC rule(s).\nIn the step 10, if the MME does not indicate support of User Plane integrity protection, or the new eNB does not support User Plane integrity protection, or the UE does not support User Plane Integrity Protection with EPS and the UP integrity protection policy is set to \"Required\" then the SMF+PGW-C releases the bearers associated with the PDN CONNECTION.\nIn the step 11, the SMF+PGW-C requests the PGW-U+UPF to establish the tunnel for each EPS bearer by providing SGW-U Tunnel Info.\nIn step 10, the SMF+PGW-C may need to report some subscribed event to the PCF by performing an SMF initiated SM Policy Association Modification procedure as defined in clause 4.16.5. If the mapped EPS bearers are not included in Modify Bearer Request, the SMF+PGW-C deletes the PCC rule(s) associated with the QoS Flows corresponding to those mapped EPS bearers.\nStep 9a from clause 5.3.3.1 (Tracking Area Update procedure with Serving GW change) in TS 23.401 [13] with the modification captured in clause 4.11.1.5.3\nIf the SCEF connection is to be established, the steps 9-13 are replaced with the steps 2-3 from clause 5.13.1.2 of TS 23.682 [23]. The SCEF+NEF ID and the EBI received from the AMF are included in the Create SCEF Connection Request.\n15-15c.\tThe HSS+UDM invokes Nudm_UECM_DeregistrationNotification to notify the AMF associated with 3GPP access with reason as 5GS to EPS Mobility. If the timer started in step 6 is not running, the old AMF removes the UE context. Otherwise, the AMF may remove UE context when the timer expires.\nThe AMF requests the release of the PDU Session(s) which is associated with 3GPP access and not expected to be transferred to EPC, i.e. AMF requests the release of:\n-\tPDU Session(s) whose corresponding SMF+PGW-C(s) are not contacted by AMF for SM context because the AMF determines that none of EBI(s) for the PDU Session can be transferred to EPS at step 5a; and\n-\tPDU Session(s) for which the SM context retrieval failed at step 5c.\nThe AMF requests the release of the SM context in the V-SMF only and the V-SMF releases resource in the V-UPF, for Home Routed PDU Session with EBIs allocated. The 5GC may also keep UE context to allow the use of native security parameters when UE moves back from EPS to 5GS later.\nIf PCC is enabled, the AMF initiates AM Policy Association Termination procedure as defined in clause 4.16.3.2 and UE Policy Association Termination procedure as defined in clause 4.16.13.1.\nRegistration associated with the non-3GPP access in the AMF is not removed (i.e. an AMF that was serving the UE over both 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses does not consider the UE as deregistered over non 3GPP access and will remain registered and subscribed to subscription data updates in UDM).\nWhen the UE decides to deregister over non-3GPP access or the old AMF decides not to maintain a UE registration for non-3GPP access anymore, the old AMF then deregisters from UDM by sending a Nudm_UECM_Deregistration service operation, unsubscribes from Subscription Data updates by sending an Nudm_SDM_Unsubscribe service operation to UDM and releases all the AMF and AN resources related to the UE.\n16 - 18.\tSteps 17-21 from clause 5.3.3.1 (Tracking Area Update procedure with Serving GW change) in TS 23.401 [13] with the following modification:\n-\tThe MME may provide the eNodeB with a PLMN list in the Handover Restriction List taking into account the last used 5GS PLMN ID and the Return preferred indication. The Handover Restriction List contains a list of PLMN IDs as specified by clause 5.2a of TS 23.251 [35] for eNodeB functions.\n-\tThe MME may not release the signalling connection with the UE based on the indication received in the step 1 that the UE is moving from 5GC.\n19.\t[conditional] Step 19 from clause 4.11.1.2.1 applies.\nIf some of the QoS Flow(s) for an EPS bearer were marked as deleted, the SMF+PGW-C may initiate bearer modification as specified in clause 5.4.3 of TS 23.401 [13] to remove the TFT filter(s) corresponding to the Packet Filter Set(s) in the QoS rules.\n4.11.1.3.2A\t5GS to EPS Idle mode mobility using N26 interface with data forwarding\nFigure 4.11.1.3.2A-1 describes the idle mode mobility registration procedure from 5GS to EPS when N26 is supported with data forwarding.\nFigure 4.11.1.3.2A-1: 5GS to EPS Idle mode mobility using N26 interface with data forwarding\n1.\tSteps 1-7 from clause 4.11.1.3.2 with the following enhancements:\n-\tThe (V-)SMF includes the Buffered DL Data Waiting indication in the Nsmf_PDUSession_Response in step 5c of figure 4.11.1.3.2-1, if the Extended buffering timer is running in (V-)SMF.\n-\tThe AMF forwards the Buffered DL Data Waiting indication to MME in step 6 of figure 4.11.1.3.2-1, if it's received from SMF above.\n2.\tSteps 7-9 from clause 5.3.3.1A of TS 23.401 [13].\n3.\tSteps 14, 15, 15a and 16 from clause 4.11.1.3.2.\n4.\tSteps 10-14 from clause 5.3.3.1A of TS 23.401 [13].\n5.\tSteps 10a, b, c from clause 4.11.1.2.1 with the following enhancements:\n-\tIf data forwarding tunnel information (i.e. Forwarding F-TEID) is received from MME in step 14 of figure 5.3.3.1A-1 of TS 23.401 [13] in step 4 above, the AMF provides the data forwarding tunnel info to (V-)SMF in Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request. The (V-)SMF provides the data forwarding tunnel info to (V-)UPF if data is buffered in (V-)UPF.\n-\tThe (V-)SMF and (V-)UPF forwards data using the provided SGW forwarding tunnel above. The (V-)SMF also initiates a timer to release the SM context or data forwarding tunnel of the PDU session.\nThe data received by the Serving GW on the forwarding tunnel is forwarded on the (newly) established tunnel to eNB.\n6.\tStep 15b from clause 4.11.1.3.2 with following enhancements:\nThe (V-)SMF initiates the release of data forwarding tunnel after the timer in step 5 above is expired.",

      "content": "Figure 4.11.1.3.3-1 describes the mobility registration procedure from EPS to 5GS when N26 is supported for idle and connected states.\nFigure 4.11.1.3.3-1: EPS to 5GS mobility for single-registration mode with N26 interface\n1.\tThe Registration procedure is triggered, e.g. the UE moves into NG-RAN coverage. Step 2 to 9 except step 5, 6 and 8 follow the Registration procedure in clause 4.2.2 with following enhancement.\n2.\tThe UE sends Registration Request with registration type set to \"Mobility Registration Update\".\nThe UE includes 5G-GUTI mapped from EPS GUTI as the old GUTI, the native 5G-GUTI (if available) as additional GUTI and indicating that the UE is moving from EPC. The UE includes the UE Policy Container containing the list of PSIs, indication of UE support for ANDSP and OSId if available.\nWhen the Registration Request is triggered due to UE mobility from EPS to 5GS, if the UE has locally deleted the EPS bearer which has allocated 5GS parameters and the EPS bearer status has not been synchronized with the network, the UE shall include the EPS bearer status in the Registration Request. If the UE has not received mapped 5GS QoS parameters from the network for PDN connection(s), the UE locally releases those PDN connection(s).\nThe Additional GUTI is provided both in Idle state and Connected state, if available. The Additional 5G-GUTI enables the AMF to retrieve the UE's MM context from the old AMF (if available). The UE includes the S-NSSAIs associated with the established PDN connections in the Requested NSSAI in RRC and NAS (as described in clause 5.15.7 of TS 23.501 [2]). In the case of Configured NSSAI applicable to this PLMN or an Allowed NSSAI are not present in the UE, the associated HPLMN S-NSSAI(s) shall be provided in the mapping of Requested NSSAI in the NAS as described in clause 5.15.5.2.1 TS 23.501 [2].\nIn the case of idle mode mobility the UE additionally includes a TAU request message integrity protected using the EPS security context (for further security verification by the MME) in the Registration Request. If the UE holds a native 5G-GUTI for this PLMN then the UE also includes the GUAMI part of the native 5G-GUTI in RRC to enable the NG-RAN to route the Registration Request to the same AMF (if available) and otherwise the UE provides in RRC signalling a GUAMI mapped from the EPS GUTI and indicates it as \"Mapped from EPS\".\nThe UE integrity protects the Registration Request message using a 5G security context (if available).\n3-4.\tSteps 2-3 of clause 4.2.2.2.2 are performed.\nIn the case of idle mode mobility, the AMF derives S-NSSAIs values for the Serving PLMN based on the S-NSSAIs values for the HPLMN, received in NAS Registration Request, associated with the established PDN connections, the AMF may send the S-NSSAIs values for the HPLMN to NSSF by invoking Nnssf_NSSelection_Get service operation and NSSF provides corresponding S-NSSAIs values for VPLMN to AMF.\nNOTE 1:\tIn connected mode mobility, the AMF devices S-NSSAIs values during the handover procedure.\nSteps 5 and 8 are not performed when this procedure is part of EPS to 5GS handover.\n5a.\t[Conditional] This step is only performed for IDLE mode mobility. The AMF derives the MME address and 4G GUTI from the old 5G-GUTI and sends Context Request to MME including EPS GUTI mapped from 5G-GUTI and the TAU request message according to TS 23.401 [13]. The MME validates the TAU message.\n5b.\t[Conditional] If step 5a is performed, step 5 from clause 5.3.3.1 (Tracking Area Update procedure with Serving GW change) in TS 23.401 [13] is performed with the modification captured in clause 4.11.1.5.3.\nThe AMF converts the received EPS MM Context into the 5GS MM Context. The received EPS UE context includes IMSI, ME Identity, UE EPS security context, UE Network Capability and EPS Bearer context(s) and may also include LTE-M Indication. The MME EPS Bearer context includes for each EPS PDN connection the IP address and FQDN for the S5/S8 interface of the SMF+PGW-C and APN. If the SCEF connection is invoked, the MME EPS Bearer context includes the SCEF+NEF ID of the PDN connection, EBI, APN, User Identity. The AMF disregards any LTE-M Indication received in the EPS UE context and instead takes into account the LTE M Indication received from NG-RAN, at step 1.\nThe AMF can determine the whether the UE is performing Inter-RAT mobility to or from NB-IoT based on the received \"TAI of last TAU\" in the EPC MM Context and the RAT Type used for the Registration Request.\nIf the Context Response includes the FQDN for the S5/S8 interface of the SMF+PGW-C, the AMF queries the NRF in serving PLMN by issuing the Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request including the FQDN for the S5/S8 interface of the SMF+PGW-C and the NRF provides the IP address or FQDN of the N11/N16 interface of the SMF+PGW-C.\nIf the Context Response includes an SCEF+NEF ID, the AMF performs the SMF selection.\nThe Context Response may include new information Return Preferred. Return Preferred is an indication by the MME of a preferred return of the UE to the last used EPS PLMN at a later access change to an EPS shared network. Based on the Return Preferred indication, the AMF may store the last used EPS PLMN ID in UE Context.\nIf the AMF cannot retrieve the address of the corresponding SMF for a PDN connection, it will not move the PDN connection to 5GS.\nStep 6 is performed only if the AMF is different from the old AMF and the old AMF is in the same PLMN as the AMF.\n6a.\t[Conditional] If the UE includes the 5G-GUTI as Additional GUTI in the Registration Request message, the AMF sends message to the old AMF. The old AMF validates the Registration request message.\nThe AMF retrieves UE's SUPI and MM Context, event subscription information by each consumer NF and the list of SM PDU Session ID/associated SMF ID for the UE using one of the following three options:\n-\tAMF may invoke the Namf_Communication_UEContextTransfer to the old AMF identified by the additional 5G-GUTI; or\n-\tif the old AMF and the AMF are in the same AMF Set and UDSF is deployed, AMF may invoke Nudsf_UnstructuredDataManagement_Query service operation for the UE identified by the additional 5G-GUTI from the UDSF; or\n-\tif the old AMF and the AMF are in the same AMF Set, AMF may use implementation specific means to share UE context.\n6b.\t[Conditional] If step 6a is performed, the response is performed as described in step 5 in clause 4.2.2.2.2. If a native 5G security context for 3GPP access is available in the AMF (or has been retrieved in step 6a), the AMF may continue to use this security context. Otherwise, the AMF shall either derive a mapped security context from the EPS security context obtained from the MME or initiate an authentication procedure to the UE.\nIf the new AMF determines that the UE has emergency PDU Session and the AMF is configured to allow emergency services for unauthenticated UE, the new AMF behaves as follows:\n-\tIf the UE has only an emergency PDU Session, the AMF either skips the authentication and security procedure in step 7 or accepts that the authentication may fail and continues the Mobility Registration Update procedure; or\n-\tIf the UE has both emergency and non emergency PDU Sessions and authentication fails, the AMF continues the Mobility Registration Update procedure and deactivates all the non-emergency PDU Sessions as specified in clause 4.3.4.2.\nNOTE 2:\tThe new AMF can determine if a PDU Session is used for emergency service by checking whether the DNN matches the emergency DNN.\n7.\t[Conditional] If the AMF determines to initiate the authentication procedure to the UE in step 6b (e.g. the AMF can not obtain the UE MM context from AMF or other reasons), steps 8-9 of clause 4.2.2.2.2 are optionally performed.\n7a.\tIn the case of idle mode mobility, the AMF decide whether a new AMF needs to be selected. If a new AMF is to be selected, the AMF reroute the Registration request to the new AMF as described in clause 4.11.1.3.4, where the initial AMF refers to the AMF.\n8.\t[Conditional] If step 5b is performed and the AMF accepts to serve the UE, the AMF sends Context Acknowledge (Serving GW change indication) to MME according to TS 23.401 [13].\n9.\tSteps 11-12 of clause 4.2.2.2.2 are optionally performed.\n10.\tVoid.\n11.\tSteps 13-14e of clause 4.2.2.2.2 are performed: This includes that if an MM context is retrieved from the old AMF in step 6 (i.e. corresponding to an existing UE registration for non-3GPP access in 5GC), then the AMF indicates to the UDM that the AMF identity to be registered in the UDM applies to both 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses by sending separate/independent Nudm_UECM_Registration service operations for \"3GPP Access\" and \"non-3GPP Access\".\n12.\tVoid.\n13.\tVoid.\n14-14f.\tStep 16 of clause 4.2.2.2.2 (AM Policy Association Establishment) is optionally performed.\nIn the home-routed roaming case and connected state mobility, based on the S-NSSAI value for the Serving PLMN of the PDU Session(s), the AMF decides whether V-SMF change is needed or not.\n-\tIf the V-SMF reallocation is not needed and if the two values (i.e. the S-NSSAI value configured in AMF for interworking and S-NSSAI value for the Serving PLMN) are different, the AMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext (PDU Session ID, S-NSSAI value for the Serving PLMN).\n-\tIf V-UPF is not changed, the V-SMF updates 5G AN with the new S-NSSAI of VPLMN by sending a N2 SM message to 5G AN via AMF.\n-\tIf V-UPF is changed, the V-SMF performs procedure as specified in clause 4.23.4.2 with the difference that I-SMF/I-UPF in clause 4.23.4.2 is replaced by V-SMF/V-UPF and with the following modification:\n-\tIn step 11 of clause 4.2.3.2 referenced by clause 4.23.4.2, the V-SMF includes in N2 SM information with the new S-NSSAI of the VPLMN.\n-\tIf the V-SMF change is needed, the AMF performs as the case of I-SMF change defined in clause 4.23.4.3 with the difference that I-SMF in clause 4.23.4.3 is replaced by V-SMF and with following modifications:\n-\tIn step 3 of clause 4.23.4.3, the AMF sends indication of no NG-RAN change to the new V-SMF.\n-\tIn step 4a of clause 4.23.4.3, when the new V-SMF retrieves SM context from the old V-SMF, the new V-SMF sends indication of no NG-RAN change as it is received in step 3.\n-\tIn step 4b of clause 4.23.4.3, as the old V-SMF receives the indication of no NG-RAN change, the old V-SMF returns additional N3 tunnel information of NG-RAN.\n-\tIn step 6 of clause 4.23.4.3, the new I-SMF should reuse the N3 tunnel information of NG-RAN received from old I-SMF/SMF.\n-\tIn step 9 of clause 4.23.4.3, when the new V-SMF sends a Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Response, the new V-SMF includes PDU Session Resource Modify in N2 SM information.\nIn the home-routed roaming case and idle state mobility, the AMF selects a default V-SMF per PDU Session and invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext service operation of the V-SMF to create an association with the AMF. It includes UE EPS PDN Connection, MSISDN as a GPSI if received from MME, H-SMF ID, S-NSSAI and indicates all the PDU Session(s) to be re-activated as received in the Registration request message along with List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated. The S-NSSAI is the S-NSSAI configured in AMF for interworking, which is associated with default V-SMF. The V-SMF creates the association and based on the received SMF ID, the V-SMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_Create request service operation of the H-SMF and provides the information received from the AMF. Before invoking Nsmf_PDUSession_Create service operation, the V-SMF request the V-UPF to provide the CN tunnel info.\nIn the home-routed roaming case and idle state mobility, the V-SMF provides the QoS constraints of the VPLMN to the H-SMF.\nThe subsequent handling is performed as follows:\n-\tThe H-SMF finds the corresponding PDU Session based on the PDN Connection Context in the request. The H-SMF initiates N4 Session modification procedure to establish the CN tunnel for the PDU Session. The tunnel info for PDU Session is allocated by PGW-U+UPF and provided to the SMF+PGW-C. The H-SMF responds V-SMF with the PDU Session ID corresponding to the PDN Connection Context in the request, the allocated EBI(s) information, the S-NSSAI of the PDU Session, S-NSSAI of HPLMN, UE EPS PDN connection(s) and other PDU session parameters, such as PDU Session Type, Session AMBR in the Nsmf_PDUSession_Create response.\n-\tThe V-SMF updates its SM contexts and returns a Nsmf_PDU_Session_CreateSMContextResponse message including the information received from the H-SMF. The V-SMF updates the V-UPF of the CN tunnel info of SMF+PGW-C. The V-SMF also includes the N2 SM Context in the response message sent to the AMF if the corresponding PDU Session is in the received List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated. The V-SMF stores an association of the PDU Session ID and the H-SMF ID. The AMF stores the V-SMF ID and it also stores S-NSSAI and the allocated EBI(s) associated to the PDU Session ID. Based on the S-NSSAI value for the Serving PLMN of the PDU Session(s) the AMF decides whether V-SMF relocation is needed or not.\n-\tIf V-SMF relocation is not needed and if the two values (i.e. the S-NSSAI value configured in AMF for interworking and S-NSSAI value for the Serving PLMN) are different, the AMF sends the S-NSSAI value for the Serving PLMN to V-SMF by invoking Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext service operation. If V-UPF change is not needed, the V-SMF updates NG RAN with the S-NSSAI value for the Serving PLMN via N2 SM message. If V-UPF change is needed, the V-SMF performs procedure as specified in clause 4.23.4.2 with the difference that I-SMF/I-UPF is replaced with V-SMF/V-UPF and with the following modification:\n-\tIn step 11 of clause 4.2.3.2 referenced by clause 4.23.4.2, the V-SMF includes in N2 SM information with the new S-NSSAI of the VPLMN.\n-\tIf V-SMF relocation is needed, the AMF performs V-SMF relocation as defined in clause 4.23.4.3.\nIn the case of home-routed roaming scenario, the V-SMF may apply VPLMN policies as described in TS 23.501 [2], clause 5.17.1.3.\nIn non-roaming and LBO cases and idle state mobility, AMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request (UE EPS PDN Connection) service operation of the SMF+PGW-C and indicates all the PDU Session(s) to be re-activated as received in the Registration request message along with List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated. This step is performed for each PDN Connection and the corresponding SMF+PGW-C address/ID in the UE context the AMF received in Step 6.\nThe SMF+PGW-C finds the corresponding PDU Session based on the PDN Connection Context in the request.\nIf the P-GW-C+SMF (H-SMF in the case of home-routed roaming case) determines that seamless session continuity from EPS to 5GS is not supported for the PDU Session, (e.g. if PDU Session ID was not received by the SMF+PGW-C for the PDN connection or PDU Session ID was received but mapped 5GS parameters were not provided to the UE due to 5GS interworking not supported), then it does not provide SM information for the corresponding PDU Session but includes the appropriate cause code for rejecting the PDU Session transfer within the N2 SM Information. The PDN connection(s) not further transferred to 5GC are locally released at the SMF+PGW-C.\nOtherwise, if session continuity from EPS to 5GS is supported for the PDU Session, the SMF+PGW-C finds the corresponding PDU Session based on the PDN Connection Context in the request. The SMF+PGW-C initiates N4 Session modification procedure to establish the CN tunnel for the PDU Session. If the SMF+PGW-C has not yet registered for this PDU Session ID, the SMF+PGW-C registers with the UDM using Nudm_UECM_Registration (SUPI, DNN, PDU Session ID) for a given PDU Session as in step 4 of PDU Session Establishment Procedure in clause 4.3.2. The tunnel info for PDU Session is allocated by PGW-U+UPF and provided to the SMF+PGW-C. The SMF+PGW-C updates its SM contexts and returns the AMF a Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Response message including the PDU Session ID corresponding to the PDN Connection Context in the request, the allocated EBI(s) information, the S-NSSAI of the PDU Session and the N2 SM Context if the corresponding PDU Session is in the received List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated. The AMF stores an association of the PDU Session ID and the SMF ID, S-NSSAI and the allocated EBI(s) associated to the PDU Session ID. Based on the allocated EBI(s) information received from all the related SMF+PGW-C for this UE, an EPS bearer status, which reflects all existing EPS bearer, is generated by the AMF.\nNOTE 3:\tFor Connected State mobility registration, the release of CN tunnels for EPS bearers and UDM registration for the session corresponding to the PDU session is performed in the handover execution phase.\nIf the PDN Type of a PDN Connection in EPS is non-IP and it was originally established as Ethernet PDU Session when UE was camping in 5GS (known based on local context information that was set to PDU Session Type Ethernet in UE and SMF), the PDU Session Type in 5GS shall be set to Ethernet by the SMF and UE. If the PDN type of a PDN Connection in EPS is non-IP and is locally associated in UE and SMF to PDU Session Type Unstructured, the PDU Session Type in 5GS shall be set to Unstructured by the SMF and UE.\nNOTE 4:\tIf the non-IP PDN Type is originally established as Ethernet PDU Session, it means that Ethernet PDN Type is not supported in EPS.\nIf the AMF has received the EPS Bearer Status in the Registration Request from UE, the AMF shall send the EPS Bearer Status to all corresponding SMF+PGW-Cs. If the SMF+PGW-C receives the EPS Bearer Status from AMF, the SMF+PGW-C shall check whether the EPS bearer(s) has been deleted by UE but not notified to network. If yes, the SMF+PGW-C shall release those EPS bearer(s), the corresponding 5G QoS Rule(s) and the QoS Flow level QoS parameters locally.\nIf the SCEF+NEF ID is provided to the SMF, the SMF establishes the SMF-NEF connection as described in steps 2-3 from clause 4.25.2, the SMF provides the SCEF+NEF ID, EBI, APN, User Identity to the SCEF+NEF and the SCEF+NEF updates the SM contexts and returns the NEF ID, PDU Session ID, DNN and User Identity to the SMF.\nIf the UE is performing Inter-RAT mobility to or from NB-IoT, the (H-)SMF will maintain, reconnect, release or leave PDU Session handling to the local VPLMN policy in the case of roaming for each PDU session according to the \"PDU Session continuity at inter RAT mobility\" subscription information. If the (H-)SMF does not have \"PDU Session continuity at inter RAT mobility\" for a PDU session, the (H-)SMF retrieves it from the UDM before determining any action. The SMF may use local policy to determine the handling a PDU Session if \"PDU Session continuity at inter RAT mobility\" cannot be retrieved from the UDM.\nAfter the step 14a, the SMF+PGW-C receives the SM context create request from AMF and the SMF+PGW-C awares that the UE returns back from EPS. When the SMF+PGW-C notifies the PCF for the PDU session of changing RAT from EPS to 5GS, the PCF for the PDU session checks if there exists a UE policy association in EPS for the UE and in that case, request the termination of such UE Policy Association to the PCF for the UE.\n15 - 16a.\tHSS+UDM cancels the location of the UE in the MME as defined in steps 13 - 14 from clause 5.3.3.1 (Tracking Area Update procedure with Serving GW change) in TS 23.401 [13]. Subsequently, the steps 18 - 19 from clause 5.3.3.1 (Tracking Area Update procedure with Serving GW change) in TS 23.401 [13] are also executed with the following modification:\nAccording to configuration, for the PDN connections which are anchored in a standalone PGW, the MME initiates PDN connection release procedure as specified in TS 23.401 [13].\n17-18.\tThese steps follow the steps 21, 21b and 22 of Registration procedure in clause 4.2.2.2.2.\nThe Registration Accept message shall include the updated 5G-GUTI to be used by the UE in that PLMN over any access. If the active flag was included in the Registration request, The AMF may provide NG-RAN with a Mobility Restriction List taking into account the last used EPS PLMN ID and the Return preferred indication. The Mobility Restriction List contains a list of PLMN IDs as specified by TS 23.501 [2]. The Allowed NSSAI in the Registration Accept message shall contain at least the S-NSSAIs corresponding to the active PDN Connection(s) and the corresponding mapping to the HPLMN S-NSSAIs.\nThe AMF shall include the EPS bearer status, which is generated at step 14, in the Registration Accept message. Based on the received EPS bearer status information, the UE shall check whether there are QoS Flow(s) existing locally but no associated EPS bearer(s) in the received EPS bearer status. The UE shall locally delete the 5G QoS Rule(s) and QoS Flow level QoS parameters of the QoS Flow(s) if the associated EPS bearer(s) do not exist in the received EPS bearer status.\n4.11.1.3.3A\tEPS to 5GS Idle mode mobility using N26 interface with data forwarding\nFigure 4.11.1.3.3A-1 describes the idle mode mobility registration procedure from EPS to 5GS when N26 is supported with data forwarding.\nFigure 4.11.1.3.3A-1: EPS to 5GS Idle mode mobility using N26 interface with data forwarding\n1.\tStep 1-7 from clause 4.11.1.3.3 with the following enhancements:\n-\tIn step 5b of the figure 4.11.1.3.3-1, if the old MME indicates Buffered DL Data Waiting in the Context Response (as specified in step 5 of clause 5.3.3.1A in TS 23.401 [13]).\n-\tFor Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation, when the DL data is buffered in old MME and the DL Data Expiration Time has not expired, the old MME shall discard the buffered DL data (as specified in step of clause 5.3.3.1A in TS 23.401 [13]).\n2.\tSteps 9-18 from clause 4.11.1.3.3 with following enhancements:\nIn step 14a of the figure 4.11.1.3.3-1, the AMF forwards the Buffered DL Data Waiting indication from above to (V-)SMF in Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext service operation.\nIf the Buffered DL Data Waiting indication is provided by AMF, the (V-)SMF and (V-)UPF shall allocate the user plane resource and include the N2 SM information (i.e. the V-CN Tunnel-Info) in the Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Response towards the AMF in step 14d of the figure 4.11.1.3.3-1 to trigger the user plane setup in NG-RAN.\nNOTE:\tAMF may send NAS message Registration Accept in step 17 of figure 4.11-1.3.3-1 as part of the N2 message in step 3 below.\n3.\tAMF to NG-RAN: N2 message (N2 MM information, N2 SM information list).\nIf N2 SM information is received from SMF in step 2 above, the AMF sends a N2 request message to setup the user plane resource.\nNG-RAN performs RRC connection Reconfiguration with the UE to setup the user plane resource and response to AMF with N2 response message with N2 SM information.\n4.\tSteps 11-13 from clause 4.11.1.2.2.2 with the following enhancement:\nBased on Buffered DL Data Waiting indication received in step 2 above, the (V-)SMF and (V-)UPF allocate data forwarding tunnel resource and provide the CN tunnel information for data forwarding from EPS (i.e. Forwarding F TEID) in Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response to AMF in step 13 of figure 4.11.1.2.2.2-1. The (V-) SMF also starts a timer for release of resources for data forwarding.\nThe (V-) SMF may select a different UPF from the serving (V-)UPF for data forwarding.\nThe (V-)SMF shall not provide Charging Enforcement Rules and QoS Enforcement Rules to the (V-)UPF for DL packets that were received via the forwarding tunnel.\n5.\tSteps 14-18 from clause 5.3.3.1A in TS 23.401 [13] with following changes.\nThe AMF sends the Context Acknowledge message to MME as in step 14 of figure 5.3.3.1A-1 in TS 23.401 [13], including the CN tunnel information (i.e. Forwarding F TEID) for data forwarding from EPS received from (V-)SMF in step 4 above.\nThe Serving GW forwards the buffered DL data to the (V-)UPF based on the Forwarding F-TEID received from MME.

EBI allocation shall not apply to PDU Session via 3GPP access supporting EPS interworking without N26 and shall not apply to PDU Session via non-3GPP access supporting EPS interworking. EBI allocation shall also not apply to PDU Session using SSC mode 2 or SSC mode 3.\nFigure 4.11.1.4.1-1: Procedures for EPS bearer ID allocation\n1.\tProcedure as listed in this step is initiated as specified in the relevant clauses of this specification. The relevant steps of the procedure as specified in the figure above are executed.\n2.\tIf the SMF+PGW-C (or H-SMF in the case of home routed case), determines, based on the indication of EPS interworking support with N26 as defined in clauses 4.11.5.2, 4.11.5.3 and 4.11.5.4 and operator policies e.g. User Plane Security Enforcement information, Access Type, that EPS bearer ID(s) needs to be assigned to the QoS flow(s) in the PDU Session, SMF+PGW-C invokes Namf_Communication_EBIAssignment Request (PDU Session ID, ARP list) (via V-SMF Nsmf_PDUSession_Update in the case of home routed case). When V-SMF receives Nsmf_PDUSession_Update request from H-SMF for EPS bearer ID allocation request, V-SMF needs to invoke Namf_Communication_EBIAssignment Request (PDU Session ID, ARP list). If the SMF+PGW-C (or H-SMF in the case of home-routed roaming) serves multiple PDU sessions for the same DNN but different S-NSSAIs for a UE, then the SMF shall only request EBIs for PDU sessions served by a common UPF (PSA). If different UPF (PSA) are serving those PDU sessions, then the SMF chooses one of the UPF (PSA) for this determination based on operator policy. When the PDU session is established via non-3GPP access, the SMF+PGW-C shall not trigger EBI allocation procedure.\nSteps 3 to 6 apply only when AMF needs to revoke EBI previously allocated for an UE in order to serve a new SMF request of EBI for the same UE.\n3.\t[Conditional] If the AMF has no available EBIs, the AMF may revoke an EBI that was assigned to QoS flow(s) based on the ARP(s) and S-NSSAI stored during PDU Session establishment, EBIs information in the UE context and local policies. If an assigned EBI is to be revoked, the AMF takes the ARP pre-emption vulnerability and the ARP priority level into consideration and revokes EBIs with a higher value of the ARP priority level first. The AMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext (EBI(s) to be revoked) to request the related SMF (called \"SMF serving the released resources\") to release the mapped EPS QoS parameters corresponding to the EBI to be revoked. The AMF stores the association of the assigned EBI, ARP pair to the corresponding PDU Session ID and SMF address.\n4.\tThe \"SMF serving the released resources\" that receives the request in step 3 shall evaluate if any of the revoked EBI(s) corresponds to the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule. If the revoked EBI corresponds to the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule, the SMF shall release the EBI(s) corresponding to all other QoS Flows of the PDU Session and update the AMF of this release by sending Namf_Communication_EBIAssignment Request (PDU Session ID, Released EBI List). Next, the SMF shall invoke Namf_Communication_N1N2Message Transfer (N2 SM information (PDU Session ID, EBI(s) to be revoked), N1 SM container (PDU Session Modification Command (PDU Session ID, EBI(s) to be revoked))) to inform the (R)AN and the UE to remove the mapped EPS QoS parameters corresponding to the EBI(s) to be revoked. In home routed roaming scenario, the H-SMF includes EBI(s) to be revoked to V-SMF to inform V-SMF to remove the mapped EPS bearer context corresponding to the EBI(s) to be revoked.\nNOTE 1:\tThe SMF can also decide to remove the QoS flow if it is not acceptable to continue the service when no corresponding EPS QoS parameters can be assigned.\nFor home routed roaming scenario, the \"SMF serving the released resources\" sends an N4 Session Modification Request to request the PGW-U+UPF to release N4 Session corresponding to the revoked EBI(s).\nIn home routed roaming case, the V-SMF starts a VPLMN initiated QoS modification for the PDU Session and the Namf_Communication_N1N2Message Transfer is invoked by the V-SMF based on the corresponding QoS modification message received from H-SMF.\n5.\tIf the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state, the AMF sends N2 PDU Session Resource Modify Request (N2 SM information received from SMF, NAS message (PDU Session ID, N1 SM container (PDU Session Modification Command))) Message to the (R)AN.\nIf the UE is in CM-IDLE state and an ATC is activated, the AMF updates and stores the UE context based on the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer and step 5-6 are skipped. When the UE is reachable, e.g. when the UE enters CM-CONNECTED state, the AMF forwards the N1 message to synchronize the UE context with the UE.\n6.\tThe rest steps of the procedure are executed as specified in the figure above.\n7\tIf the AMF successfully assigns EBI(s), it responds with the assigned EBI(s). Otherwise, it responds with a cause indicating EBI assignment failure. If the PDU Session is associated to an S-NSSAI subject for Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization the AMF should indicate EBI assignment failure.\nIf a PDU Session from another SMF already exists towards the same DNN, the AMF either rejects the EBI assignment request, or revokes the EBI(s) from the existing PDU Session(s) to the same DNN but different SMFs if the AMF makes the decision based on the operator policy, that the existing PDU Session cannot support EPS interworking N26.\nThe AMF stores the DNN and SMF+PGW-C in which the PDU Session(s) support EPS interworking to UDM in clause 4.11.1.6.\nNOTE 2:\tThe above applies only when the S-NSSAI(s) for the PDU Sessions are different, otherwise the same SMF is selected for PDU Sessions to the same DNN.\n8.\tThe SMF+PGW-C sends an N4 Session Establishment/Modification Request to the PGW-U+UPF.\nFor home routed roaming scenario, if the EBI is assigned successfully, the SMF+PGW-C prepares the CN Tunnel Info for each EPS bearer. For non roaming and LBO scenario, if the EBI is assigned successfully, the SMF+PGW-C may prepare the CN Tunnel Info for each EPS bearer.\nThe PGW-U+UPF allocates the PGW-U tunnel info for the EPS bearer and sends it to the SMF+PGW-C. The PGW-U+UPF is ready to receive uplink packets from E-UTRAN.\nNOTE 3:\tIn the home routed roaming scenario the SMF+PGW-C prepares the CN Tunnel Info for each EPS bearer and provide it to V-SMF. Thus when the UE move to EPC network, the V-SMF does not need interact with the SMF+PGW-C to get the EPS bearer context(s).\n9.\tIf the SMF+PGW-C receives any EBI(s) from the AMF, it adds the received EBI(s) into the mapped EPS bearer context(s).\nIn home routed roaming scenario, the SMF+PGW-C generates EPS bearer context which includes per EPS bearer PGW-U tunnel information. In addition, if the default EPS bearer is generated for the corresponding PDN Connection of PDU Session (i.e. during the PDU Session establishment procedure), the SMF+PGW-C generates the PGW-C tunnel information of the PDN connection and include it in UE EPS PDN connection.\n9a.\t[Conditional] In non-roaming or LBO scenario, the SMF+PGW-C includes the mapped EPS bearer context(s) and the corresponding QoS Flow(s) to be sent to the UE in the N1 SM container. SMF+PGW-C also indicates the mapping between the QoS Flow(s) and mapped EPS bearer context(s) in the N1 SM container. SMF+PGW-C also includes the mapping between the received EBI(s) and QFI(s) into the N2 SM information to be sent to the NG-RAN. The SMF+PGW-C sends the N1 SM container and N2 SM information to AMF via the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response in the case of the PDU Session Modification procedure triggered by UE or AN, or UE Triggered Service Request procedure that results in session transfer from N3GPP to 3GPP, otherwise, via the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer.\n9b\t[Conditional] In home routed roaming scenario, the SMF+PGW-C sends mapped EPS bearer context(s), the mapping between the received EBI(s) and QFI(s), linked EBI and EPS bearer context(s) to V-SMF via Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Response in the case of PDU Session Establishment, or via Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request in the case of PDU Session Modification. The V-SMF stores the EPS bearer context(s) and generates N1 SM container and N2 SM information and forwards them to AMF via the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response in the case of the PDU Session Modification procedure triggered by UE or AN, or UE Triggered Service Request procedure that results in session transfer from N3GPP to 3GPP, otherwise, via the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer.\n10.\tThe N1 SM container and N2 SM information are sent to the UE and NG-RAN respectively.

UEs in dual-registration mode may perform this step any time after the completing of E-UTRAN Initial Attach procedure. Also, UEs in dual-registration mode may perform this step only for a subset of PDU Sessions.\nThe MME determines the SMF+PGW-C address for the Create Session Request based on the APN if received from the UE, local Emergency Configuration Data (as in clause 4.11.0a.4) and the subscription profile which may include the Emergency Information received from the HSS+UDM in Step 9 or when the HSS+UDM notifies the MME for the new SMF+PGW-C ID in the updated subscription profile.\nThe SMF+PGW-C uses the PDU Session ID to correlate the transferred PDN connection with the PDU Session in 5GC.\nAs a result of the procedure the PGW-U+UPF starts routing DL data packets to the Serving GW for the default and any dedicated EPS bearers established for this PDN connection.\n14.\tFor Non-Roaming case and Roaming with Local Breakout, the SMF+PGW-C initiates release of the PDU Session(s) in 5GS transferred to EPS as specified in clause 4.3.4.2 with the following clarification:\n-\tIn step 2, the SMF+PGW-C shall not release IP address/prefix(es) allocated for the PDU Session;\n-\tIf UP connection of the PDU Session is not active, step 3b is not executed, thus the steps triggered by step 3b are not executed;\nIf UP connection of the PDU Session is active, the SMF invokes the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation in step 3b without including N1 SM container (PDU Session Release Command);\n-\tIn step 11, Nsmf_PDUSession_SMContexStatusNotify service operation invoked by the SMF to notify AMF that the SM context for this PDU Session is released due to handover to EPS.\nFor Home Routed roaming, the SMF+PGW-C initiates release of the PDU Session(s) in 5GS transferred to EPS as specified in clause 4.3.4.3 with the following clarification:\n-\tIn step 3a, the H-SMF invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_Update service operation without including N1 SM container (PDU Session Release Command);\n-\tIn step 16a, Nsmf_PDUSession_StatusNotify operation invoked by H-SMF to notify the V-SMF that the PDU session context is released due to handover to EPS;\n-\tIn step 16b, Nsmf_PDUSession_SMContexStatusNotify service operation invoked by the V-SMF to notify AMF that the SM context for this PDU Session is released due to handover to EPS.",

The procedure is the General Registration procedure as captured in clause 4.2.2. Difference from that procedure are captured below.\nThe UE has one or more ongoing PDN connections including one or more EPS bearers. During the PDN connection establishment, the UE allocates the PDU Session ID and sends it to the SMF+PGW-C via PCO, as described in clause 4.11.1.1.\nFigure 4.11.2.3-1: Mobility procedure from EPS to 5GS without N26 interface\n0.\tThe UE is attached in EPC as specified in clause 4.11.2.4.1.\n1.\tStep 1 in clause 4.2.2.2.2 (General Registration) with the following clarifications:\nThe UE indicates that it is moving from EPC. The UE in single registration mode provides the Registration type set to \"mobility registration update\", a 5G-GUTI mapped from the 4G-GUTI and a native 5G-GUTI (if available) as an Additional GUTI. The UE includes the UE Policy Container containing the list of PSIs, indication of UE support for ANDSP and OSId if available. The UE shall select the 5G-GUTI for the additional GUTI as follows, listed in decreasing order of preference:\n-\ta native 5G-GUTI assigned by the PLMN to which the UE is attempting to register, if available;\n-\ta native 5G-GUTI assigned by an equivalent PLMN to the PLMN to which the UE is attempting to register, if available;\n-\ta native 5G-GUTI assigned by any other PLMN, if available.\nThe UE in dual registration mode provides the Registration type set to \"initial registration\" and a native 5G-GUTI or SUCI. In single registration mode, the UE also includes at least the S-NSSAIs (with values for the Serving PLMN) associated with the established PDN connections in the Requested NSSAI in RRC Connection Establishment.\n2.\tStep 2 as in clause 4.2.2.2.\n3.\tStep 3 as in clause 4.2.2.2.2 (General Registration), with the following modifications:\nIf the Registration type is \"mobility registration update\" and the UE indicates that it is moving from EPC in step 1 and the AMF is configured to support 5GS-EPS interworking procedure without N26 interface, the AMF treats this registration request as \"initial Registration\" and the AMF skips the PDU Session status synchronization.\nNOTE 1:\tThe UE operating in single registration mode includes the PDU Session IDs corresponding to the PDN connections to the PDU Session status.\nIf the UE has provided a 5G-GUTI mapped from 4G-GUTI in step 1 and the AMF is configured to support 5GS-EPS interworking procedure without N26 interface, the AMF does not perform steps 4 and 5 in clause 4.2.2.2 (UE context transfer from the MME).\n4.\tSteps 4-13 as in clause 4.2.2.2.2 (General Registration), with the following modifications:\nIf the UE has included an additional GUTI in the Registration Request, then the new AMF attempts to retrieve the UE's security context from the old AMF in steps 4 and 5.\nIf the UE's security context is not available in the old AMF or if the UE has not provided an additional GUTI then the AMF retrieves the SUCI from the UE in steps 6 and 7.\n5.\tStep 14 as in clause 4.2.2.2.2 (General Registration), with the following modifications:\nIf the UE indicates that it is moving from EPC and the Registration type is set to \"initial registration\" or \"mobility registration update\" in step 1 and AMF is configured to support 5GS-EPS interworking without N26 procedure, the AMF sends an Nudm_UECM_Registration Request message to the HSS+UDM indicating that registration of an MME at the HSS+UDM, if any, shall not be cancelled. The HSS+UDM does not send cancel location to the old MME.\nNOTE 2:\tIf the UE does not maintain registration in EPC, upon reachability time-out, the MME can implicitly detach the UE and release the possible remaining PDN connections in EPC.\nThe subscription profile the AMF receives from HSS+UDM includes the DNN/APN and SMF+PGW-C FQDN for S5/S8 interface for each PDN connection established in EPC. For emergency PDU Session, the AMF receives Emergency Information containing SMF+PGW-C FQDN from HSS+UDM.\n6.\tSteps 15-19c as in clause 4.2.2.2.2 (General Registration).\n7.\tStep 21 as in clause 4.2.2.2.2 (General Registration) with the following modifications:\nThe AMF includes an \"Interworking without N26\" indicator to the UE.\nIf the UE had provided PDU Session Status information in step 1, the AMF Sets the PDU Session Status to not synchronized.\n8.\tStep 22 as in clause 4.2.2.2.2 (General Registration)\n9.\tUE requested PDU Session Establishment procedure as in clause 4.3.2.2.1.\nIf the UE had setup PDN Connections in EPC which it wants to transfer to 5GS and maintain the same IP address/prefix and the UE received \"Interworking without N26\" indicator in step 7, the UE performs the UE requested PDU Session Establishment Procedure as in clause 4.3.2.2 and sets the Request Type to \"Existing PDU Session\" or \"Existing Emergency PDU Session\" in step 1 of the procedure. The UE provides a DNN for non-emergency PDU Session, the PDU Session ID and S-NSSAI corresponding to the existing PDN connection it wants to transfer from EPS to 5GS. The S-NSSAI is set as described in clause 5.15.7.2 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf the Request Type indicates \"Existing Emergency PDU Session\", the AMF shall use the Emergency Information received from the HSS+UDM which contains SMF+PGW-C FQDN for S5/S8 interface for the emergency PDN connection established in EPS and the AMF shall use the S-NSSAI locally configured in Emergency Configuration Data.\nUEs in single-registration mode performs this step for each PDN connection immediately after the step 8. UEs in dual-registration mode may perform this step any time after step 8. Also, UEs in dual-registration mode may perform this step only for a subset of PDU Sessions. The AMF determines the S5/S8 interface of the SMF+PGW-C for the PDU Session based on the DNN received from the UE and the SMF+PGW-C ID in the subscription profile received from the HSS+UDM in step 5 or when the HSS+UDM notifies the AMF for the new SMF+PGW-C ID in the updated subscription profile. The AMF queries the NRF in serving PLMN by issuing the Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request including the FQDN for the S5/S8 interface of the SMF+PGW-C and the NRF provides the IP address or FQDN of the N11/N16 interface of the SMF+PGW-C. The AMF invokes the Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext service with the SMF address provided by the NRF. The AMF includes the PDU Session ID to the request sent to the SMF+PGW-C.\nThe SMF+PGW-C uses the PDU Session ID to determine the correct PDU Session.\nAfter step 16a of Figure 4.3.2.2.1-1 in clause 4.3.2.2.1, user plane is switched from EPS to 5GS.\nAs specified clause 4.3.2.2, if the SMF has not yet registered for the PDU Session ID, then the SMF registers with the UDM using Nudm_UECM_Registration (SUPI, DNN, PDU Session ID) and if Session Management Subscription data for corresponding SUPI, DNN and S-NSSAI is not available, then SMF retrieves the Session Management Subscription data using Nudm_SDM_Get (SUPI, Session Management Subscription data, DNN, S-NSSAI) and subscribes to be notified when this subscription data is modified using Nudm_SDM_Subscribe (SUPI, Session Management Subscription data, DNN, S-NSSAI).\nNOTE 3:\tThe SMF can, instead of the Nudm_SDM_Get service operation, use the Nudm_SDM_Subscribe service operation with an Immediate Report Indication that triggers the UDM to immediately return the subscribed data if the corresponding feature is supported by both the SMF and the UDM.\n10.\tThe SMF+PGW-C performs release of the resources in EPC for the PDN connections(s) transferred to 5GS by performing the PDN GW initiated bearer deactivation procedure as defined in clause 5.4.4.1 of TS 23.401 [13], except the steps 4-7.",

The UE provides the PDU Session ID in PCO as described in clause 4.11.1.1. For PDU Session of Ethernet Type, if the UE and the network support Ethernet PDN Type in EPS which is negotiated during PDU Session Establishment as described in clause 4.11.5, the UE includes PDN Type Ethernet in PDN CONNECTIVITY Request message.\nIf the UE supports URSP provisioning in EPS, the UE also includes the \"Indication of URSP Provisioning Support in EPS\" in the PCO or in the ePCO in the first PDN CONNECTIVITY Request or during Initial Attach procedure. The PDN CONNECTIVITY Request is sent together with Initial Attach request as described in clause 5.17.8 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf the TAU was rejected in step 2 the IP address preservation is not provided. In this case the UE provides IMSI in the Attach Request and does not provide a Request Type \"Handover\" in the PDN CONNECTIVITY Request if included in the Attach Request.\nThe UE provides an EPS bearer ID for all mapped EPS bearers in the EPS bearer status. For the initial Attach Request the EPS bearer status is empty.\nNOTE 1:\tThe UE is aware the network is configured to support 5GS-EPS interworking without N26 procedure. The UE does not include the EPS bearer IDs corresponding to the 5G QoS flows to the EPS bearer status.\nIf the UE supports 5GC NAS procedures (see clause 5.17.2 of TS 23.501 [2]), then the UE shall indicate its support of 5G NAS in a NAS indicator.\n-\tStep 3:\nIf the UE provided a 4G-GUTI mapped from 5G-GUTI and the MME is configured to support 5GS-EPS interworking without N26 procedure, the MME does not perform step 3, Identification Request to old MME/SGSN/AMF in clause 5.3.2.1 of TS 23.401 [13].\nNOTE 2:\tAs the 4G-GUTI mapped from 5G-GUTI is unknown identity to the MME, the MME sends an Identity Request to the UE to request the IMSI. The UE responds with Identity Response (IMSI).\n-\tStep 8:\nIf the UE indicates that it is moving from 5GC (Attach Request) and the MME is configured to support 5GS-EPS interworking without N26 procedure, the MME sends an Update Location Request message to the HSS+UDM indicating that registration of an AMF at the HSS+UDM, if any, shall not be cancelled.

If the update flag parameter from the SMF+PGW-C indicates update value, i.e. during inter access mobility, the NSACF locates the existing entry with UE ID and NF ID and replaces the Access Type in the existing entry. The NSACF may take the Access Type into account for UE counting based on local policy. The followings applies:\n-\tIf the new Access Type is taken into account and if there was one UE ID entry in the new Access Type with same NF ID then NSACF shall not increase the count again.\n-\tIf the new Access Type is taken into account and if there was one UE ID entry in the new Access Type with different NF ID then NSACF may add this new NF ID in the UE entry and shall not increase the count.\n-\tIf the new Access Type is taken into account and if there are no entries for the UE, then the entry is added and the count for the new Access Type shall be increased.\n-\tIf the old Access Type is taken into account and if there was only one UE ID entry with same NF ID in the old Access Type then NSACF removes the UE ID entry and decrease the count if there was no other NF ID in this UE ID entry.

During this interaction procedure, for option 2, when the NSACF identifies that either the number of UEs or the number of PDUs for the S-NSSAI is exceeded then the NSACF may also provide the corresponding indication of NSAC for maximum number of UEs or NSAC for maximum number of PDUs in Nnsacf_NSAC_NumOfPDUsUpdate message to the Primary NSACF. Based on the received indication, the Primary NSACF either delegates the NSAC update request to the NSACF (i.e. adjusts the local maximum number related to corresponding indication) or reject the request. For more details on handling between the NSACF and Primary NSACF see clause 4.2.11.2a.\nNOTE 3:\tFor both options, given that the SMF+PGW-C can not provide the UE already registered indication to NSACF, hence when the NSACF interacts with Primary NSACF, the Primary NSACF either delegate the NSAC update request to the NSACF or reject the NSAC update request from the NSACF.\n-\tFor NSAC for number of PDU Sessions, when the local maximum number is reached, the NSACF may interact with the Primary NSACF before it returns the response back to the SMF+PGW-C.

All the details of a registration procedure, including interactions with UDM, etc. are specified in clause 4.2.2.2.2.\nFigure 4.12.2.2-1: Registration via untrusted non-3GPP access\n1.\tThe UE connects to an untrusted non-3GPP Access Network with any appropriate authentication procedure and it is assigned an IP address. For example, a non-3GPP authentication method can be used, e.g. no authentication (in the case of a free WLAN), EAP with pre-shared key, username/password, etc. When the UE decides to attach to 5GC network, the UE not operating in SNPN access mode for NWu interface selects an N3IWF in a 5G PLMN, as described in clause 6.3.6 of TS 23.501 [2]. When the UE decides to attach to 5GC network, the UE operating in SNPN access mode for NWu interface selects an N3IWF in an SNPN, as described in clause 6.3.6.2a of TS 23.501 [2].\nNOTE 1:\tThe UE Selection of a N3IWF that supports the S-NSSAIs needed by the UE is enabled based on ANDSP configuration defined in TS 23.501 [2]. The N3IWF selection based on this information is documented in TS 23.501 [2].\n2.\tThe UE proceeds with the establishment of an IPsec Security Association (SA) with the selected N3IWF by initiating an IKE initial exchange according to RFC 7296 [3]. After step 2, all subsequent IKE messages are encrypted and integrity protected by using the IKE SA established in this step.\n3.\tThe UE shall initiate an IKE_AUTH exchange by sending an IKE_AUTH request message. The AUTH payload is not included in the IKE_AUTH request message, which indicates that the IKE_AUTH exchange shall use EAP signalling (in this case EAP-5G signalling). If the UE supports MOBIKE, it shall include a Notify payload in the IKE_AUTH request, as specified in RFC 4555 [40], indicating that MOBIKE is supported. In addition, as specified in TS 33.501 [15], if the UE is provisioned with the N3IWF root certificate, it shall include the CERTREQ payload within the IKE_AUTH request message to request the N3IWF's certificate. In the case of WLAN access, if the UE has an MPS subscription, the UE shall include a Notify payload in the IKE_AUTH request indicating its MPS subscription.\nNOTE 2:\tBased on operator policy, the N3IWF can use the MPS subscription indication at this time to handle this UE with priority.\n4.\tThe N3IWF responds with an IKE_AUTH response message, which includes an EAP-Request/5G-Start packet. The EAP-Request/5G-Start packet informs the UE to initiate an EAP-5G session, i.e. to start sending NAS messages encapsulated within EAP-5G packets. If the N3IWF has received a CERTREQ payload from the UE, the N3IWF shall include the CERT payload in the IKE_AUTH response message containing the N3IWF's certificate. How the UE uses the N3IWF's certificate is specified in TS 33.501 [15].\n5.\tThe UE shall send an IKE_AUTH request, which includes an EAP-Response/5G-NAS packet that contains the Access Network parameters (AN parameters) and a Registration Request message. The AN parameters contain information that is used by the N3IWF for selecting an AMF in the 5G core network. This information includes e.g. the GUAMI, the Selected PLMN ID (or PLMN ID and NID, see clause 5.30 of TS 23.501 [2]), the Requested NSSAI and the Establishment cause. The Establishment cause provides the reason for requesting a signalling connection with 5GC and the N3IWF may use the Establishment cause to determine the DSCP value on N2.. Whether and how the UE includes the Requested NSSAI as part of the AN parameters is dependent on the value of the Access Stratum Connection Establishment NSSAI Inclusion Mode parameter, as specified in clause 5.15.9 of TS 23.501 [2]. The registration request may contain an indication that the UE supports N3IWF selection based on the slices the UE wishes to use over untrusted non-3GPP access (i.e. that the UE supports Extended Home N3IWF identifier configuration and Slice-specific N3IWF prefix configuration). If at step 1 the UE selects the N3IWF based on Tracking/Location Area of same PLMN as described in clause 6.3.6 of TS 23.501 [2], the UE may include this TA in the last visited TAI in registration request in order to help the AMF to determine the target N3IWF as described in step 17. If the UE in SNPN access mode for NWu interface performs the Registration procedure for UE onboarding, the UE shall include an indication in the AN parameters that the connection request is for onboarding. The Registration Type \"SNPN Onboarding\" indicates that the UE wants to perform SNPN Onboarding Registration.\nNOTE 3:\tThe N3IWF does not send an EAP-Identity request because the UE includes its identity in the first IKE_AUTH. This is in line with RFC 7296 [3] clause 3.16.\n6.\tThe N3IWF shall select an AMF based on the received AN parameters and local policy, as specified in clause 6.3.5 of TS 23.501 [2]. The N3IWF shall then forward the Registration Request received from the UE to the selected AMF within an N2 message. This message contains N2 parameters that include the Selected PLMN ID and optionally the Selected NID and the Establishment cause.\nNOTE 4:\tThe Selected NID is present when the UE connects to an SNPN via Untrusted non-3GPP access.\n7.\tThe selected AMF may decide to request the SUCI by sending a NAS Identity Request message to UE. This NAS message and all subsequent NAS messages are sent to UE encapsulated within EAP/5G-NAS packets. The AMF may use the Establishment cause to determine the Message Priority header and then the DSCP value for subsequent signalling according to TS 29.500 [17].\n8.\tThe AMF may decide to authenticate the UE by invoking an AUSF. In this case, the AMF shall select an AUSF as specified in clause 6.3.4 of TS 23.501 [2] based on SUPI or SUCI.\nThe AUSF executes the authentication of the UE as specified in TS 33.501 [15]. The AUSF selects a UDM as described in clause 6.3.8 of TS 23.501 [2] and gets the authentication data from UDM. The authentication packets are encapsulated within NAS authentication messages and the NAS authentication messages are encapsulated within EAP/5G-NAS packets. After the successful authentication:\n-\tIn step 8h, the AUSF shall send the anchor key (SEAF key) to AMF which is used by AMF to derive NAS security keys and a security key for N3IWF (N3IWF key). The UE also derives the anchor key (SEAF key) and from that key it derives the NAS security keys and the security key for N3IWF (N3IWF key). The N3IWF key is used by the UE and N3IWF for establishing the IPsec Security Association (in step 11).\n-\tIn step 8h, the AUSF shall also include the SUPI, if in step 8a the AMF provided to AUSF a SUCI.\nNOTE 5:\tEAP-AKA' or 5G-AKA are allowed for the authentication of UE via non-3GPP access, as specified in TS 33.501 [15]. Figure 4.12.2.2-1 only shows authentication flow using EAP-AKA'. Authentication methods other than EAP-AKA' or 5G-AKA are also allowed for UE accessing SNPN services via a PLMN, as specified in TS 33.501 [15], Annex I, as well as for UE accessing SNPN services directly via Untrusted non-3GPP access.\nIf the UE in SNPN access mode for NWu interface performs the Registration procedure for UE onboarding, the interaction between AMF and AUSF (step 8a, 8b, 8g and 8h in Figure 4.12.2.2-1) is replaced with step 9-1 or step 9-2 or step 9-3 in Figure 4.2.2.2.4-1, depending on the 5GC architecture that is used for UE onboarding.\n9a.\tThe AMF shall send a NAS Security Mode Command to UE in order to activate NAS security. If an EAP-AKA' authentication was successfully executed in step 8, the AMF shall encapsulate the EAP-Success received from AUSF within the NAS Security Mode Command message.\n9b.\tThe N3IWF shall forward the NAS Security Mode Command message to UE within an EAP/5G-NAS packet.\n9c.\tThe UE completes the EAP-AKA' authentication (if initiated in step 8), creates a NAS security context and an N3IWF key and sends the NAS Security Mode Complete message within an EAP/5G-NAS packet.\n9d.\tThe N3IWF relays the NAS Security Mode Complete message to the AMF.\n10a.\tUpon receiving NAS Security Mode Complete, the AMF shall send an NGAP Initial Context Setup Request message that includes the N3IWF key.\n10b.\tThis triggers the N3IWF to send an EAP-Success to UE, which completes the EAP-5G session. No further EAP-5G packets are exchanged.\n11.\tThe IPsec SA is established between the UE and N3IWF by using the common N3IWF key that was created in the UE in step 9c and received by the N3IWF in step 10a. This IPsec SA is referred to as the \"signalling IPsec SA\". After the establishment of the signalling IPsec SA, the N3IWF notifies the AMF that the UE context (including AN security) was created by sending a NGAP Initial Context Setup Response. The signalling IPsec SA shall be configured to operate in tunnel mode and the N3IWF shall assign to UE:\na)\tan \"inner\" IP address; and\nb)\ta NAS_IP_ADDRESS and a TCP port number.\nThe N3IWF may apply a DSCP value to this signalling IPsec SA, in which case all IP packets exchanged between the UE and N3IWF via the \"signalling IPsec SA\" shall be marked with this DSCP value. If the N3IWF has received an indication that the UE supports MOBIKE (see step 3), then the N3IWF shall include a Notify payload in the IKE_AUTH response message sent in step 11a, indicating that MOBIKE shall be supported, as specified in RFC 4555 [40].\nNOTE 6:\tThe DSCP value is determined by operator policy, and may e.g., be based on the DSCP value on N2.\nAll subsequent NAS messages exchanged between the UE and N3IWF shall be sent via the signalling IPsec SA and shall be carried over TCP/IP. The UE shall send NAS messages within TCP/IP packets with source address the \"inner\" IP address of the UE and destination address the NAS_IP_ADDRESS that is received in step 11a. The N3IWF shall send NAS messages within TCP/IP packets with source address the NAS_IP_ADDRESS and destination address the \"inner\" IP address of the UE. The TCP connection used for reliable NAS transport between the UE and N3IWF shall be initiated by the UE right after the signalling IPsec SA is established in step 11a. The UE shall send the TCP connection request to the NAS_IP_ADDRESS and to the TCP port number specified in TS 24.502 [41].\n12.\tThe AMF determines the allowed subset of the Requested NSSAI that is allowed by the Subscribed S-NSSAI(s); the AMF may detect that the N3IWF used by the UE is not compatible with this allowed subset and based on operator's policy configured in the AMF, the AMF determines whether a different N3IWF should be used. If the UE supports slice-based N3IWF selection and the AMF determines to use a different N3IWF, then the AMF proceeds with steps 15-19. Otherwise, i.e. if the AMF determines to use the selected N3IWF that supports part of the allowed subset, the AMF proceeds with steps 13 and 14. In this case, steps 15-19 are skipped.\nNOTE 7:\tThe AMF considers the subscribed S-NSSAI(s) before determining to trigger the UE PCF to avoid triggering the UE PCF to update the UE policies for Requested S-NSSAIs that the UE is not subscribed for.\n13.\tThe AMF sends the NAS Registration Accept message in an N2 message sent to the N3IWF. The N2 Message includes the Allowed NSSAI for the access type for the UE. The Allowed NSSAI is a subset of the slices supported by the selected N3IWF.\n14.\tThe N3IWF forwards the NAS Registration Accept message to UE via the established signalling IPsec SA. If the NAS Registration Accept message is received by the N3IWF before the IPsec SA is established, the N3IWF shall store it and forward it to the UE only after the establishment of the signalling IPsec SA.\n14b.\tThe AMF may trigger a UE policy association as described in clause 4.2.2.2.2 if a UE policy association does not exist yet. If the UE Registration Request contains an indication that the UE supports N3IWF selection based on the slices the UE wishes to use over untrusted non-3GPP access the AMF indicates to the PCF that the UE supports N3IWF selection based on the slices the UE wishes to use over untrusted non-3GPP access.\nSteps 15 to 19 correspond to the case where the AMF has detected that the N3IWF used by the UE is not compatible with the subset of the requested NSSAI that is allowed by the subscribed S-NSSAI(s).\n15.\tIf the AMF is able to select a UE PCF that supports UE policies for slice specific N3IWF selection, the AMF may trigger UE policy association establishment if a suitable UE policy association does not exist yet. The AMF indicates to the PCF that the UE supports N3IWF selection based on the slices the UE wishes to use over untrusted non-3GPP access.\nThe AMF triggers the UE PCF to update the UE policies for slice specific N3IWF selection.\nThe AMF requests the PCF to receive a notification when the PCF has completed the update of these UE policies.\n16.\tThe PCF updates the UE policies for slice specific N3IWF selection per the procedure defined in figure 4.2.4.3-1. When the update of these UE policies is completed, the PCF notifies the AMF by invoking Npcf_UEPolicyControl_UpdateNotify.\n17.\tThe AMF sends via the N3IWF a UE Registration Reject indicating that the UE selected N3IWF was not appropriate for the requested slices that the UE is allowed to access to. The AMF optionally may provide target N3IWF information (FQDN and/or IP address) to the UE within the Registration Reject message.\nNOTE 8:\tThe AMF uses locally configured N3IWF information to provide target N3IWF information.\nNOTE 9:\tThe AMF may determine a target N3IWF that supports the subset of the requested NSSAI that is allowed by the subscribed S-NSSAI(s) based on the list of supported TAs and the corresponding list of supported slices for each TA obtained in N2 interface management procedures as specified in TS 38.413 [10]. To determine the target N3IWF, the AMF may take into account UE location corresponding to last visited TAI included in Registration Request as described at step 5 when the UE selects N3IWF based on Tracking/Location Area of same PLMN.\n18.\tIf supported by the UE and if the UE received target N3IWF information in step 17, the UE connects to the target N3IWF, otherwise the UE may perform N3IWF selection again using the updated N3IWF selection information received in step 16. The UE uses the target N3IWF information in the Registration Reject only for the N3IWF selection directly following the rejected registration and UE shall not store for future use.\nThe AMF provides the Access Type set to \"Non-3GPP access\" to the UDM when it registers with the UDM and the RAT type determined as specified in clause 5.3.2.3 of TS 23.501 [2].\nNOTE 10:\tThe Access Type and the RAT type are is set to \"Untrusted Non-3GPP access\" even when the UE accesses SNPN services via PLMN over 3GPP access.",

During this procedure:\na\tAn AMF (source AMF) is selected by the N3IWF in step 6a, based on non-geographical criteria (e.g. because the UE has no 3GPP access coverage or because only non-geographically selectable N3IWF are deployed).\nb\tThe UE receives, within the Registration Accept message, a 5G-GUTI containing a GUAMI of the non-geographically selected AMF. The UE also receives an Allowed NSSAI and optionally Mapping Of Allowed NSSAI.\n2.\tThe UE may activate PDU Sessions over non-3GPP access, as described in clause 4.12.5.\n3.\tThe UE gets 3GPP access and issues a Registration Request over 3GPP access as defined in step 1 of Figure 4.2.2.2.2-1, providing its 5G-GUTI.\nIf the 5G-GUTI does not indicate an AMF of the same Region ID as that of the NG-RAN, the NG-RAN selects an AMF Set and an AMF in the AMF Set as described in clause 6.3.5 of TS 23.501 [2].\nSteps 3 to 22 of Figure 4.2.2.2.2-1 take place including following aspects:\n-\tstep 4 of Figure 4.2.2.2.2-1 takes place i.e. the new AMF invokes the Namf_Communication_UEContextTransfer service operation on the old AMF to request the UE's SUPI and MM Context.\n-\tin step 5 of Figure 4.2.2.2.2-1, the old AMF includes information about active NGAP association to N3IWF.\n-\tin step 18 of Figure 4.2.2.2.2-1, the new AMF modifies the NGAP association toward N3IWF.\n-\tin step 21 of Figure 4.2.2.2.2-1, the Registration Accept message shall include the updated 5G-GUTI that the UE will use to update its 3GPP and non-3GPP registration contexts.\n4.12a\tProcedures for Trusted non-3GPP access\n4.12a.1\tGeneral\nClause 4.12a defines the procedures to support trusted non-3GPP access by describing the differences compared to the defined procedures in other clauses.\n4.12a.2\tRegistration via Trusted non-3GPP Access\n4.12a.2.1\tGeneral\nClause 4.12a.2 specifies how a UE can register to 5GC via a trusted non-3GPP Access Network. The utilized procedure is very similar with the 5GC registration procedure over untrusted non-3GPP access in clause 4.12.2.2 and it is based on the Registration procedure specified in clause 4.2.2.2.2. It uses the same vendor-specific EAP method (called \"EAP-5G\") as the one specified in clause 4.12.2.1. In this case, the \"EAP-5G\" method is used between the UE and the TNGF and is utilized for encapsulating NAS messages.\nIn Registration and subsequent Registration procedures via trusted non-3GPP access, the NAS messages are always exchanged between the UE and the AMF. When possible, the UE can be authenticated by reusing the existing UE security context in AMF.\n4.12a.2.2\tRegistration procedure for trusted non-3GPP access\nThe UE connects to a trusted non-3GPP Access Network (TNAN) and it also registers to 5GC over via this TNAN, by using the EAP-based procedure shown in the figure 4.12a.2.2. This procedure is very similar with the 5GC registration procedure over untrusted non-3GPP access in clause 4.12.2.2. The link between the UE and the TNAN can be any data link (L2) that supports EAP encapsulation, e.g. PPP, PANA, Ethernet, IEEE 802.3, IEEE 802.11, etc. The interface between the TNAP and TNGF is an AAA interface.\nFigure 4.12a.2.2-1: Registration via trusted non-3GPP access\n0.\tThe UE which is not operating in SNPN access mode for Yt interface selects a PLMN and a TNAN for connecting to this PLMN by using the Trusted Non-3GPP Access Network selection procedure specified in clause 6.3.12 of TS 23.501 [2]. During this procedure, the UE discovers the PLMNs with which the TNAN supports trusted connectivity (e.g. \"5G connectivity\").\nThe UE operating in SNPN access mode for Yt interface selects an SNPN and a TNAN for connecting to this SNPN by using the Trusted Non-3GPP Access Network selection procedure specified in clause 5.30.2.13 of TS 23.501 [2]. During this procedure, the UE discovers the SNPNs with which the TNAN supports trusted connectivity (e.g. \"5G connectivity\").\nNOTE 1:\tIn this Release, it is assumed that when the trusted non-3GPP access is a trusted WLAN access, the UE is configured (e.g. with the WLANSP rules defined in TS 23.503 [20]) to select an TNAN(SSID and TNGF) associated with a non-3GPP Tracking Area, which supports one or more of the UE's subscribed S-NSSAIs.\n1.\tA layer-2 connection is established between the UE and the TNAP. In the case of IEEE Std 802.11 [48], this step corresponds to an 802.11 Association. In the case of PPP, this step corresponds to a PPP LCP negotiation. In other types of non-3GPP access (e.g. Ethernet), this step may not be required.\n2-3.\tAn EAP procedure is initiated. EAP messages are encapsulated into layer-2 packets, e.g. into IEEE 802.3/802.1x packets, into IEEE 802.11/802.1x packets, into PPP packets, etc. The NAI provided by the UE not operating in SNPN access mode for Yt interface indicates that the UE requests \"5G connectivity\" to a specific PLMN and is defined in clause 28.7.6 of TS 23.003 [33]. In the case of WLAN access, if the UE has an MPS subscription, the UE shall also include an indication of its MPS subscription in the username part of the NAI as per TS 23.003 [33]. The NAI provided by the UE operating in SNPN access mode for Yt interface indicates that the UE request \"5G connectivity\" to a specific SNPN and is defined in clause 28.7.6 of TS 23.003 [33]. If the WLANSP rule contains information including TNGF ID to use for specific slices and the UE supports such information, the UE builds the realm of NAI taking the TNGF ID into account. This NAI is defined in clause 28.7.6 of TS 23.003 [33] and triggers the TNAP to send an AAA request to a TNGF, which operates as an AAA proxy.\nBetween the TNAP and TNGF the EAP packets are encapsulated into AAA messages. The AAA request also include the TNAP identifier, which can be treated as the User Location Information defined in clause 5.6.2 of TS 23.501 [2]. In order to support usage of the TNAP identifier defined in TS 23.316 [53], when a 5G-RG acts as a TNAP , the W-5GAN may, as defined in clause 5.6.2 of TS 23.501 [2], provide the 5G RG civic address information in the TNAP identifier.\nNOTE 2:\tIn this Release, it is assumed that when the trusted non-3GPP access is a trusted WLAN access, the TNAP selects a TNGF based on the realm (e.g. MCC, MNC and TNGF ID) provided by the UE and also based on the SSID selected by the UE. In a deployment a TNGF may be reached over different SSID(s) where the TNGF supports a Tracking Area and be associated with a set of slices, or an SSID may provide access to one or more TNGF(s), where each of these TNGF(s) can support a different Tracking Area and a different set of slices.\nNOTE 3:\tBased on operator policy, after receiving the indication of MPS subscription from the UE, the TNAN can treat this UE with priority.\n4-10.\tAn EAP-5G procedure is executed as the one specified in clause 4.12.2.2 for the untrusted non-3GPP access with the following modifications:\n-\tThe registration request may contain an indication that the UE supports TNGF selection based on the slices the UE wishes to use over trusted non-3GPP access (i.e. that the UE supports Extended WLANSP rule).\n-\tA TNGF key (instead of an N3IWF key) is created in the UE and in the AMF after the successful authentication. The TNGF key is transferred from the AMF to TNGF in step 10a (within the N2 Initial Context Setup Request). The TNGF derives a TNAP key, which is provided to the TNAP. The TNAP key depends on the non-3GPP access technology (e.g. it is a Pairwise Master Key in the case of IEEE Std 802.11 [48]). How these security keys are created, it is specified in TS 33.501 [15].\n-\tIn step 5 the UE shall include the Requested NSSAI in the AN parameters only if allowed, according to the conditions defined in clause 5.15.9 of TS 23.501 [2], for the trusted non-3GPP access. The UE shall also include a UE Id in the AN parameters, e.g. a 5G-GUTI if available from a prior registration to the same PLMN or SNPN. If the UE in SNPN access mode for Yt interface performs the Registration procedure for UE onboarding, the UE shall include an indication in the AN parameters that the connection request is for onboarding.\n-\tIn the N2 message sent in step 6b, the TNGF includes a UE Location Information (ULI)including the TNAP ID and the UE IP address based on information received in step 3. If the ULI includes the IP address, this is set to a \"null\" IP address (e.g. 0.0.0.0) because the UE is not yet assigned an IP address. If the TNGF has received the TNAP ID in step 3 over Ta, the TNGF includes the TNAP ID within UE Location Information (ULI) sent to AMF. After the UE is assigned an IP address, the TNGF includes this address in subsequent N2 messages. This N2 message also includes the Selected PLMN ID and optionally the Selected NID and the Establishment cause.\nNOTE 4:\tThe Selected NID is present when the UE connects to an SNPN via Trusted non-3GPP access.\n-\tIf the UE in SNPN access mode for Yt interface performs the Registration procedure for UE onboarding, the interaction between AMF and AUSF (step 8a and step 8c in Figure 4.12a.2.2-1) is replaced with step 9-1 or step 9-2 or step 9-3 in Figure 4.2.2.2.4-1, depending on the 5GC architecture that is used for UE onboarding.\n-\tAfter receiving the TNGF key from AMF in step 10a, the TNGF shall send to UE an EAP-Request/5G-Notification packet containing the \"TNGF Contact Info\", which includes the IP address of TNGF. After receiving an EAP-Response/5G-Notification packet from the UE in step 10c, the TNGF shall send message 10d containing the EAP-Success packet.\n11.\tThe TNAP key is used to establish layer-2 security between the UE and TNAP. In the case of IEEE Std 802.11 [48], a 4-way handshake is executed, which establishes a security context between the WLAN AP and the UE that is used to protect unicast and multicast traffic over the air.\n12.\tThe UE receives IP configuration from the TNAN, e.g. with DHCP.\n13.\tAt this point, the UE has successfully connected to the TNAN and has obtained IP configuration. The UE sets up a secure NWt connection with the TNGF as follows:\nThe UE initiates an IKE_INIT exchange using the IP address of TNGF received during the EAP-5G signalling, in step 10b. Subsequently, the UE initiates an IKE_AUTH exchange and provides its identity. The identity provided by the UE in the IKEv2 signalling should be the same as the UE Id included in the AN parameters in step 5. This enables the TNGF to locate the TNGF key that was created before for this UE, during the authentication in step 8. The TNGF key is used for mutual authentication. NULL encryption is negotiated between the UE and the TNGF, as specified in RFC 2410 [49].\nIn step 13c, the TNGF provides to UE (a) an \"inner\" IP address, (b) a NAS_IP_ADDRESS and a TCP port number and (c) a DSCP value. After this step, an IPsec SA is established between the UE and TNGF. This is referred to as the \"signalling IPsec SA\" and operates in Tunnel mode. Operation in Tunnel mode enables the use of MOBIKE [40] for re-establishing the IPsec SAs when the IP address of the UE changes during mobility events. All IP packets exchanged between the UE and TNGF via the \"signalling IPsec SA\" shall be marked with the above DSCP value. The UE and the TNAP may map the DSCP value to a QoS level (e.g. to an EDCA Access Class [48]) supported by the underlying non-3GPP Access Network. The mapping of a DSCP value to a QoS level of the non-3GPP Access Network is outside the scope of 3GPP.\nRight after the establishment of the \"signalling IPsec SA\", the UE shall setup a TCP connection with the TNGF by using the NAS_IP_ADDRESS and the TCP port number received in step 13c. The UE shall send NAS messages within TCP/IP packets with source address the \"inner\" IP address of the UE and destination address the NAS_IP_ADDRESS. The TNGF shall send NAS messages within TCP/IP packets with source address the NAS_IP_ADDRESS and destination address the \"inner\" IP address of the UE.\nThis concludes the setup of the NWt connection between the UE and the TNGF. All subsequent NAS messages between UE and TNGF are carried over this NWt connection (i.e. encapsulated in TCP/IP/ESP).\n14.\tAfter the NWt connection is successfully established, the TNGF responds to AMF with an N2 Initial Context Setup Response message.\n15.\tThe AMF determines the allowed subset of the Requested NSSAI that is allowed by the Subscribed S-NSSAI(s); the AMF may detect that the TNGF used by the UE is not compatible with this allowed subset and based on operator's policy configured in the AMF, the AMF determines whether a different TNGF should be used. If the UE supports slice-based TNGF selection and the AMF determines to use a different TNGF, then the AMF proceeds with steps 17-21. Otherwise, i.e. if the AMF determines to use the selected TNGF that supports part of allowed the subset, the AMF proceeds with step 16. In this case, steps 17-21 are skipped.\nNOTE 5:\tThe criteria for the AMF to determine that the TNGF used by the UE is not compatible with the subset of the requested NSSAI that is allowed by the subscribed S-NSSAI(s) is based on local AMF policies. For example the AMF can determine that the TNGF used by the UE is compatible as soon as there is one supported slice in common.\n16a-16b.\tThe NAS Registration Accept message is sent by the AMF and is forwarded to UE via the established NWt connection. Now the UE can use the TNAN (a) to transfer non-seamless offload traffic and (b) to establish one or more PDU Sessions.\n16c.\tThe AMF may trigger a UE policy association as described in clause 4.2.2.2.2 if a UE policy association does not exist yet. If the UE Registration Request contains an indication that the UE supports TNGF selection based on the slices the UE wishes to use over untrusted non-3GPP access the AMF indicates to the PCF that the UE supports TNGF selection based on the slices the UE wishes to use over trusted non-3GPP access.\nSteps 17 to 21 correspond to the case where the AMF has detected that TNGF used by the UE is not compatible with the subset of the requested NSSAI that is allowed by the subscribed S-NSSAI(s).\n17.\tIf the AMF is able to select a UE PCF that supports UE policies for slice specific trusted access selection, the AMF may trigger UE policy association establishment if a suitable UE policy association does not exist yet. The AMF indicates to the PCF that the UE supports TNGF selection based on the slices the UE wishes to use over trusted non-3GPP access.\nThe AMF triggers the UE PCF to update the UE policies for slice specific trusted access selection.\nThe AMF requests the PCF to receive a notification when the PCF has completed the update of these UE policies.\n18.\tThe PCF updates the UE policies for slice specific trusted access selection according to the procedure defined in figure 4.2.4.3-1.\n19.\tWhen the update of these policies is completed, the PCF notifies the AMF by invoking Npcf_UEPolicyControl_UpdateNotify.\n20.\tThe AMF sends via the TNGF a UE Registration Reject indicating that the selected TNGF was not appropriate for the requested slices that the UE is allowed to access to. The AMF may provide target TNAN information (SSID, TNGF ID) to the UE within the Registration Reject message indicating the UE to build the NAI based on the TNGF ID.\nNOTE 6:\tThe AMF may determine a target TNGF that supports the subset of the requested NSSAI that is allowed by the subscribed S-NSSAI(s) based on the list of supported TAs and the corresponding list of supported slices for each TA obtained in N2 interface management procedures as specified in TS 38.413 [10] and considering UE location.\n21.\tIf supported by the UE and if the UE received target TNAN information in step 20, the UE connects to the target TNAN, otherwise the UE may perform TNAN selection again using the updated WLANSP rule received in step 18. If the target TNAN information includes TNGF ID, the UE shall build the NAI based on TNGF ID. The UE uses the target TNAN information in the Registration Reject only for the TNAN selection directly following the rejected registration and UE shall not store it for future use.\n4.12a.2.3\tEmergency Registration for trusted non-3GPP Access\nEmergency Registration procedure for trusted non-3GPP access shall be supported as specified in clause 4.12.2.3 for untrusted non-3GPP access with the following differences:\n-\tThe regular registration shall refer to clause 4.12a.2.\n-\tThe N3IWF is substituted by the TNGF.\n-\tThe N3IWF key is substituted by the TNGF key.\n4.12a.3\tDeregistration procedure for Trusted non-3GPP access\nThe Deregistration procedure via trusted non-3GPP access shall be supported as specified in clause 4.12.3 for the untrusted non-3GPP access with the following modifications:\n-\tThe untrusted non-3GPP access is substituted by a trusted non-3GPP access point (TNAP).\n-\tThe N3IWF is substituted by the TNGF.\n-\tIf the UE has reserved QoS resources over non-3GPP access by using the Additional QoS Information (specified in clause 4.12a.5), then the UE shall release these resources.\n4.12a.4\tN2 procedures via Trusted non-3GPP Access\n4.12a.4.1\tService Request procedures via Trusted non-3GPP Access\nThe Service Request procedure via trusted non-3GPP access shall be supported as specified in clause 4.12.4.1 for the untrusted non-3GPP access with the following modifications:\n-\tThe untrusted non-3GPP access is substituted by a trusted non-3GPP access.\n-\tThe N3IWF is substituted by the TNGF.\n-\tThe user plane between the UE and TNGF is established with IKEv2 signalling, as specified in clause 4.12a.5 (i.e. by using an IKEv2 Create_Child_SA exchange). The IKEv2 Create Child SA Request shall include the Additional QoS Information to reserve non-3GPP specific QoS resources as defined in clause 4.12a.5.\n4.12a.4.2\tProcedure for the UE context release in the TNGF\nThis procedure for releasing the N2 signalling connection and the N3 user plane connection for a UE connected to 5GC via trusted non-3GPP access, shall be the same as the procedure specified in clause 4.12.4.2 for the untrusted non-3GPP access with the following modifications:\n-\tThe untrusted non-3GPP access is substituted by a trusted non-3GPP access point (TNAP).\n-\tThe N3IWF is substituted by the TNGF.\n-\tIf the UE has reserved any non-3GPP specific QoS resources, the UE releases these resources when the IKEv2 Child SA is released.\n4.12a.4.3\tCN-initiated selective deactivation of UP connection of an existing PDU Session associated with Trusted non-3GPP Access\nThe procedure described in clause 4.3.7 (CN-initiated selective deactivation of UP connection of an existing PDU Session) is used for CN-initiated selective deactivation of UP connection for an established PDU Session associated with trusted non-3GPP Access for a UE in CM-CONNECTED state, with the following exceptions:\n-\tThe NG-RAN corresponds to a TNAN including a TNGF.\n-\tThe user plane between the UE and TNGF, i.e. Child SA(s) for the PDU Session, is released not with RRC signalling but with IKEv2 signalling, as specified in clause 4.12a.7.\n-\tIf the UE has reserved any non-3GPP specific QoS resources, the UE releases these resources when the IKEv2 Child SA is released.\n4.12a.5\tUE Requested PDU Session Establishment via Trusted non-3GPP Access\nAfter the UE registers to 5GC via trusted non-3GPP access, the UE may request a PDU Session establishment by using the same procedure as the one specified in clause 4.12.5 for untrusted non-3GPP access, with the following modifications:\n-\tThe N3IWF in Figure 4.12.5-1 should be substituted with a TNGF and the Untrusted non-3GPP access should be substituted with a Trusted non-3GPP Access Point (TNAP).\n-\tThe TNGF may send a TNGF Identities parameter to AMF inside an N2 Uplink NAS Transport message. The TNGF Identities parameter contains a list of identifiers (i.e. FQDNs or IP addresses) of N3 terminations supported by the TNGF. If received by the AMF, it shall forward it to the SMF, which may use it as input to UPF selection. The AMF provides ULI information received from TNGF to the SMF which then propagates it to the PCF.\n-\tThe IKEv2 Create Child SA Request message that is sent by the TNGF to UE (in steps 4a and 4c), in order to establish a child SA for one or more QoS flows, shall also include Additional QoS Information. The Additional QoS Information shall contain:\na)\tIf the IPsec child SA carries a GBR flow: QoS Characteristics and GBR QoS Flow Information:\n-\tThe QoS Characteristics are associated with the 5QI of the GBR flow and are defined in clause 5.7.3 of TS 23.501 [2]. The TNGF either receives the QoS Characteristics via the N2 interface (in the case of a dynamically assigned 5QI), or is pre-configured with the QoS Characteristics (in the case of a standardized 5QI).\n-\tThe GBR QoS Flow Information (defined in TS 38.413 [10]) is part of the QoS Profile received via the N2 interface and contains: MFBR, GFBR and optionally Maximum Packet Loss Rate. The Notification Control is not included in the QoS profile.\nb)\tIf the IPsec child SA carries a non-GBR flow: QoS Characteristics:\n-\tThe QoS Characteristics are defined in bullet a) above.\nThe TNGF may aggregate multiple GBR flows or multiple non-GBR flows into the same IPsec child SA. In this case, the TNGF derives, in an implementation specific way, the QoS Characteristics of the aggregated flow by considering the QoS Characteristics of the individual flows. Similarly, the TNGF derives, in an implementation specific way, the GBR QoS Flow Information of an aggregated GBR flow by considering the GBR QoS Flow Information of the individual GBR flows.\nNOTE:\tThe above behaviour of the TNGF does not create any impact on the N2 interface.\n-\tAfter receiving an IKEv2 Create Child SA Request message, the UE shall use the Additional QoS Information contained in this message to determine what QoS resources to reserve over the non-3GPP access, including e.g. guaranteed bit rates and delay bounds for UL/DL communication. How the UE determines what QoS resources to reserve over the non-3GPP access and how these QoS resources are reserved, is outside the scope of 3GPP specifications.\n-\tIf the UE fails to reserve QoS resources over non-3GPP access for the QoS flows associated with the child SA (e.g. because the non-3GPP Access Network rejects the allocation of the requested bit rates), the UE shall reject the IKEv2 Child SA Request. Based on operator policy, the network may reattempt to establish the Child SA without the Additional QoS Information.\n4.12a.6\tUE or network Requested PDU Session Modification via Trusted non-3GPP access\nThe UE or network requested PDU Session Modification procedure via trusted non-3GPP access is the same procedure as the one specified in clause 4.12.6 for untrusted non-3GPP access, with the following modifications:\n-\tThe N3IWF in Figure 4.12.6-1 should be substituted with a TNGF and the Untrusted non-3GPP access should be substituted with a Trusted non-3GPP Access Point (TNAP).\n-\tThe IKEv2 Create Child SA Request sent by the TNGF in step 4a, in order to create new QoS flow(s) for the PDU Session, shall include the Additional QoS Information defined in clause 4.12a.5. If the UE decides to reserve QoS resources over non-3GPP access for the QoS flows associated with the Child SA but fails to reserve these resources, the UE shall reject the IKEv2 Child SA Request. Based on operator policy, the network may reattempt to establish the Child SA without the Additional QoS Information.\n-\tThe IKEv2 Informational Request sent by the TNGF in step 4b shall include the Additional QoS Information defined in clause 4.12a.5, when the IKEv2 Informational Request is sent to modify one or more existing QoS flows. If the UE decides to reserve QoS resources over non-3GPP access for the QoS flows associated with the Child SA but fails to reserve these resources, the UE shall indicate the failure in the IKEv2 Informational Response. The TNGF includes the list of QoS flows which are failed to setup in step 5. Based on operator policy, the network may reattempt to modify the failed QoS Flows without the Additional QoS Information.\n-\tThe IKEv2 Informational Request sent by the TNGF in step 4c to release an existing IKEv2 Child SA shall trigger the UE to release the resources reserved over non-3GPP access for this IKEv2 Child SA.\n-\tIf, after the PDU Session establishment, the UE determines that the QoS resources reserved over non-3GPP access for the QoS flows associated with a Child SA are released, then the UE shall initiate an INFORMATIONAL exchange, as specified in RFC 7296 [3], to delete the Child SA. After the Child SA is deleted, the TNGF initiates PDU Session Modification procedure as described in step 1e, in clause 4.3.3.2, including the list of QoS flows, which are released.\n4.12a.7\tUE or network Requested PDU Session Release via Trusted non-3GPP access\nThe UE or the network can release a PDU Session via a trusted non-3GPP Access Network as specified in clause 4.12.7 for the untrusted non-3GPP access with the following modifications:\n-\tThe untrusted non-3GPP access is substituted by a trusted non-3GPP access point (TNAP).\n-\tThe N3IWF is substituted by the TNGF.\n-\tIf the UE reserved any non-3GPP specific QoS resources, the UE releases these resources when the IKEv2 Child SA is released.\n4.12a.8\tMobility from a non-geographically selected AMF to a geographically selected AMF\nThe procedure specified in clause 4.12.8 for untrusted non-3GPP access applies also to the trusted non-3GPP access with the following modifications:\n-\tThe untrusted non-3GPP access is substituted by a trusted non-3GPP access point (TNAP).\n-\tThe N3IWF is substituted by the TNGF.\n-\tThe PDU Session is activated in step 2 as specified in clause 4.12a.5.\n4.12a.9\tSupport of mobility from source to target TNAP\nIn this Release, if the UE moves from a source TNAP to a target TNAP, the UE shall perform a full authentication via the target TNAP to re-connect to the 5G system.\n4.12b\tProcedures for devices that do not support 5GC NAS over WLAN access\n4.12b.1\tGeneral\nAs specified in clause 4.2.8.5 of TS 23.501 [2], devices that do not support 5GC NAS signalling over WLAN access (referred to as \"Non-5G-Capable over WLAN\" devices, or N5CW devices for short), may access 5GC in a PLMN or an SNPN via a trusted WLAN Access Network that supports a Trusted WLAN Interworking Function (TWIF). The following clause specifies how a N5CW device can be registered to 5GC and how it can send data via a PDU Session.\nA N5CW device may be 5G-capable over 3GPP access, in which case it is also a 5G UE over 3GPP access.\n4.12b.2\tInitial Registration & PDU Session Establishment\nFigure 4.12b.2-1 illustrates how the N5CW device can connect to a trusted WLAN Access Network and simultaneously register to a 5G core network. A single EAP-based authentication procedure is executed for connecting the N5CW device to the trusted WLAN Access Network and for registering the N5CW device to the 5G core network.\nFigure 4.12b.2-1: Initial registration and PDU session establishment\n0.\tThe N5CW device selects a PLMN (or SNPN) and a trusted WLAN that supports \"5G connectivity-without-NAS\" to this PLMN (or SNPN) by using the procedure specified in clause 6.3.12a and clause 5.30.2.15 of TS 23.501 [2] for access to PLMN and SNPN, respectively.\nSteps 1-10:\tInitial registration to 5GC.\n1.\tThe N5CW device associates with the selected trusted WLAN and the EAP authentication procedure is initiated.\n2.\tThe N5CW device provides its Network Access Identity (NAI). The Trusted WLAN Access Point (TWAP) selects a Trusted WLAN Interworking Function (TWIF), e.g. based on the received realm and sends an AAA request to the selected TWIF.\nIf the N5CW device has not registered over 3GPP access to 5GC of the selected PLMN or SNPN when the above procedure is initiated, then the NAI includes the SUCI as specified in clause 28.7.7 of TS 23.003 [33]. For example, when accessing a PLMN the NAI can have the following format: NAI=type1.rid678.schid0.useriduser17@nai.5gc-nn.mnc<MNC>.mcc<MCC>.3gppnetwork.org. If the selected PLMN is VPLMN, the N5CW device should use the decorated NAI format as specified in clause 28.7.9 of TS 23.003 [33] to indicate to TWAN which is the selected VPLMN, for example, NAI=nai.5gc-nn.mnc<MNC_Home>.mcc<MCC_Home>.3gppnetwork.org!type1.rid678.schid0.useriduser17@nai.5gc-nn.mnc<MNC_visited>.mcc<MCC_visited>.3gppnetwork.org.\nIf the N5CW device has registered to 5GC over 3GPP access to 5GC of the selected PLMN or SNPN (i.e. it is also a 5G UE) when the above procedure is initiated, then the NAI includes the 5G-GUTI assigned to N5CW device over 3GPP access. This enables the TWIF in step 4a below to select the same AMF as the one serving the N5CW device over 3GPP access.\nIf the N5CW device accesses to SNPN with the credentials owned by Credentials Holder, the decorated NAI as specified in clause 28.7.9 of TS 23.003 [33] should be provided. For example, NAI=nai.5gc-nn.nid<NID_Home>.mnc<MNC_Home>.mcc<MCC_Home>.3gppnetwork.org!type1.rid678.schid0.useriduser17@nai.5gc-nn.nid<NID_visited>.mnc<MNC_visited>.mcc<MCC_visited>.3gppnetwork.org.\nThe NAI provided by the N5CW device in step 2b indicates that the N5CW device wants \"5G connectivity-without-NAS\" towards a specific PLMN or SNPN (i.e. the PLMN or SNPN selected in step 0). For example, when accessing a PLMN, the NAI can have the following format: NAI=<5G-GUTI>@nai.5gc-nn.mnc<MNC>.mcc<MCC>.3gppnetwork.org or NAI=nai.5gc-nn.mnc<MNC_Home>.mcc<MCC_Home>.3gppnetwork.org!type1.rid678.schid0.useriduser17@nai.5gc-nn.mnc<MNC_visited>.mcc<MCC_visited>.3gppnetwork.org, the N5CW device indicating that it wants \"5G connectivity-without-NAS\" (5gc-nn) to the PLMN with MCC=<MCC> and MNC=<MNC> and to the PLMN with MCC=<MCC_visited> and MNC=<MNC_visited>.\n3.\tThe TWIF creates a 5GC Registration Request message on behalf of the N5CW device. The TWIF uses default values to populate the parameters in the Registration Request message, which are the same for all N5CW devices. The Registration type indicates \"Initial Registration\".\nIf the TWIF receives a Decorated NAI, in Registration Request message the TWIF send the NAI which corresponds to the HPLMN by removing the decoration, for example NAI=type1.rid678.schid0.useriduser17@ nai.5gc-nn.mnc<MNC_Home>.mcc<MCC_Home>.3gppnetwork.org.\n4.\tThe TWIF selects an AMF by using the 5G-GUTI in the NAI, or selects the AMF of the VPLMN indicates by the realm of the decoration in the Decorated NAI, for example \"mnc<MNC_visited>.mcc<MCC_visited>.3gppnetwork.org\" or selects the AMF by using the local configuration. TWIF sends an N2 message to the AMF including the Registration Request, the User Location and an AN Type.\nIf the N5CW device provides a Decorated NAI to the TWIF, the TWIF shall select the AMF in the visited PLMN/SNPN as per decoration part and remove the decoration part from the Decorated NAI (i.e. change the format to NAI format of SUCI as defined in clause 28.7.7 of TS 23.003 [33]) and provides it to AMF in the Registration Request. For example, if the NAI is \"nai.5gc-nn.nid<NID_Home>.mnc<MNC_Home>.mcc<MCC_Home>.3gppnetwork.org!type1.rid678.schid0.useriduser17@nai.5gc-nn.nid<NID_visited>.mnc<MNC_visited>.mcc<MCC_visited>.3gppnetwork.org.\", the TWIF selects the AMF in the SNPN corresponding to \"nai.5gc-nn.nid<NID_visited>.mnc<MNC_visited>.mcc<MCC_visited>.3gppnetwork.org.\" and provides the AMF in the Registration Request with the NAI of \"type1.rid678.schid0.useriduser17@ nai.5gc-nn.nid<NID_Home>.mnc<MNC_Home>.mcc<MCC_Home>.3gppnetwork.org\".\n5.\tThe AMF triggers an authentication procedure by sending a request to AUSF indicating the AN type.\n6.\tAn EAP authentication procedure takes place between the N5CW device and AUSF. Over the N2 interface, the EAP messages are encapsulated within NAS Authentication messages. The type of EAP authentication procedure is specified in TS 33.501 [15].\nNOTE:\tThe SUPI used for authentication does not take the format of Decorated NAI.\n7.\tAfter a successful authentication, the AUSF sends to AMF the EAP-Success message and the created SEAF key. The AMF derives an AN key from the received SEAF key.\n8.\tThe NAS Security Mode Command (SMC) is sent from the AMF to the TWIF. The selected NAS security algorithms of integrity protection and ciphering are set to NULL.\n9.\tThe AMF sends an N2 Initial Context Setup Request and provides the AN key to TWIF. In turn, the TWIF derives a Pairwise Master Key (PMK) from the AN key and sends the PMK key and the EAP-Success message to the Trusted WLAN Access Point, which forwards the EAP-Success to the N5CW device. The PMK is the key used to secure the WLAN air-interface communication according to IEEE Std 802.11 [48]. A layer-2 or layer-3 connection is established between the Trusted WLAN Access Point and the TWIF for transporting all user-plane traffic of the N5CW device to TWIF. This connection is later bound to an N3 connection that is created for this N5CW device.\n10.\tFinally, the AMF sends a Registration Accept message to TWIF. At this point, the N5CW device is connected to the WLAN Access Network and is registered to 5GC.\nSteps 20-21:\tPDU Session Establishment.\n20.\tThe TWIF creates a PDU Session Establishment Request message on behalf of the N5CW device and sends this message to AMF. This may be triggered by receiving an IP configuration request (e.g. DHCP Offer/Request) from the N5CW device. The TWIF may use default values to populate the parameters in the PDU Session Establishment Request message, but may also skip some PDU session parameters and let the AMF or the SMF determine these parameters based on the N5CW device subscription information received during the registration procedure. This way, default PDU session parameters can be used per N5CW device.\nThe value of the PDU Session id provided by TWIF in step 20c shall always be the same. It will be a value reserved for the PDU sessions requested by the TWIF and it will be different from the values that can be used by the N5CW device when requesting a PDU session over 3GPP access. This way, the PDU session id provided by the TWIF cannot be the same with the PDU Session ID of any PDU session established by the N5CW device over 3GPP access.\n21.\tThe AMF sends upon request of the SMF an N2 PDU Session Request message to TWIF in order to reserve the appropriate Access Network resources. This N2 message includes the PDU Session Establishment Accept message. In step 21b, the TWIF may reserve WLAN access resources for the user-plane communication between the N5CW device and TWIF. If and how this resource reservation is performed is outside the scope of 3GPP.\nAfter the establishment of the PDU session, the TWIF assigns IP configuration data to N5CW device (e.g. with DHCP). The IP address assigned to N5CW device is the IP address allocated to the PDU session.\nStep 25:\tUser plane communication.\nThe TWIF binds the N5CW device-specific L2/L3 connection created in step 9g with the N3 connection created in step 21. All user-plane traffic sent by the N5CW device is forwarded to TWIF via the L2/L3 connection and then to UPF via the N3 connection. The TWIF operates as a Layer-2 relay.\nThe TWIF may receive URSP rules (see TS 23.503 [20]), which indicate the traffic that should be offloaded locally by TWIF (sent outside the PDU session) and the traffic that should be sent inside the PDU session.\nThe above procedure supports only one PDU session per N5CW device whose parameters are either configured for all N5CW devices in the TWIF or are derived from default values in the N5CW device subscription.\nIf the TWIF is co-located with one or more local UPFs then:\n-\tIn step 20c (N2 Uplink NAS Transport), the TWIF may send a TWIF Identities parameter to AMF. The TWIF Identities parameter contains a list of identifiers (i.e. FQDNs or IP addresses) of N3 terminations supported by the TWIF.\n-\tIf received by the AMF, it shall forward it to the SMF when invoking Nsmf_PDUSessionCreateSMContext i.e. at the establishment of the PDU Session. The SMF may use this information to select a local UPF for the PDU Session.\n4.12b.3\tDeregistration procedure\nThe Deregistration procedure for devices (N5CW devices) that do not support 5G NAS signalling over WLAN access shall be supported as specified in clause 4.12a.3 for the trusted non-3GPP access with the following modifications:\n-\tThe TNAP is substituted by a trusted WLAN access point (TWAP).\n-\tThe TNGF is substituted by the Trusted WLAN Interworking Function (TWIF).\n-\tThe TWIF sends and receives NAS deregistration request/accept messages on behalf of N5CW device.\n-\tFor both UE/Network-initiated deregistration procedures, the TWIF may initiate the release of Yt' connection between the N5CW device and TWIF.\n-\tUE-initiated deregistration procedure can be initiated by the TWIF, when it has lost connectivity to the N5CW device.\n4.12b.4\tN2 procedures\n4.12b.4.1\tService Request procedures\nThe Service Request procedure for devices that do not support 5G NAS signalling over WLAN access shall be used by a TWIF when the CM state in TWIF for a N5CW device is CM-IDLE over Trusted WLAN to request the re-establishment of the NAS signalling connection and the re-establishment of the user plane for all or some of the PDU Sessions which are associated to non-3GPP access.\nThe Service Request procedure for N5CW devices shall be used by a TWIF when the CM state in TWIF for a N5CW device is CM-CONNECTED over trusted WLAN to request the re-establishment of the user plane for one or more PDU Sessions which are associated to non-3GPP access.\nThis Service Request procedure shall be supported as specified in clause 4.12a.4.1 for the trusted non-3GPP access with the following modifications:\n-\tThe trusted non-3GPP access is substituted by a trusted WLAN access point (TWAP).\n-\tThe TNGF is substituted by the TWIF.\n-\tThe TWIF sends and receives NAS messages on behalf of N5CW device.\n-\tThe user plane between the N5CW device and TWIF is established with Yt' connection instead of IKEv2 signalling.\n4.12b.4.2\tProcedure for the UE context release in the TWIF\nThis procedure for releasing the N2 signalling connection and the N3 user plane connection for a N5CW device connected to 5GC via trusted WLAN access, shall be the same as the procedure specified in clause 4.12a.4.2 for the trusted non-3GPP access with the following modifications:\n-\tThe trusted non-3GPP access is substituted by a TWAP.\n-\tThe TNGF is substituted by the TWIF.\n-\tThe TWIF may initiate the release of Yt' connection between the N5CW device and TWIF.\n4.12b.4.3\tCN-initiated selective deactivation of UP connection of an existing PDU Session\nThe procedure described in clause 4.3.7 (CN-initiated selective deactivation of UP connection of an existing PDU Session) is used for CN-initiated selective deactivation of UP connection for an established PDU Session associated with Trusted WLAN access for a N5CW device in CM-CONNECTED state, with the following exceptions:\n-\tThe NG-RAN corresponds to a TNAN including a TWIF.\n-\tThe user plane between the N5CW device and TWIF is released without neither RRC signalling nor IKEv2 signalling.",

If this check fails, the NEF sends an Nnef_Trigger_Delivery response with a cause value indicating the reason for the failure condition and the flow stops at this step. Otherwise, the flow continues with step 4.\n4.\tThe NEF invokes Nudm_SDM_Get (Identifier Translation, GPSI and AF Identifier) to resolve the GPSI to SUPI when the AF is authorized to trigger the UE.\nNOTE 1:\tOptionally, mapping from GPSI (External Id) to GPSI (MSISDN) is also provided for legacy SMS infrastructure not supporting MSISDN-less SMS.\n5.\tThe UDM may invoke the Nudr_DM_Query service to retrieve a list of AF's that are allowed to trigger the UE and determines, based on UDM policy, which identifier (SUPI or MSISDN) should be used to trigger the UE. The UDM provides a Nudm_SDM_Get response (SUPI, optionally MSISDN.

The UDM provides a Nudm_UECM_Get response with the corresponding UE SMSF identities. UDM policy (possibly dependent on the VPLMN ID) may influence which serving node identities are returned.\nNOTE 3:\tThe NEF can cache serving node information for the UE. However, this can increase the probability of trigger delivery attempt failures when the cached serving node information is stale.\n8.\tThe NEF selects a suitable SMS-SC based on configured information. The NEF acts as an MTC-IWF and sends a Submit Trigger (GPSI, SUPI, AF Identifier, trigger reference number, validity period, priority, SMSF serving node ID(s) (if available, are obtained from UDM in step 7), SMS Application port ID, trigger payload, Trigger Indication) message to the SMS-SC.\nIf the NEF indicates that \"Absent subscriber\" was received from the UDM, the SMS-SC should not submit the message, but store it directly and send Routing Information for SM to request the UDM to add the SMS-SC address to the Message Waiting List.\n9.\tThe SMS-SC sends a Submit Trigger Confirm message to the NEF to confirm that the submission of the SMS has been accepted by the SMS-SC.\n10.\tThe NEF sends a Nnef_Trigger_Delivery response to the AF to indicate if the Device Trigger Request has been accepted for delivery to the UE.\n11.\tThe SMS_SC performs MT SMS delivery as defined in clause 4.13.3. The SMS-SC may provide the routing information that it received in step 6 to SMS-GMSC to avoid UDM interrogation. The SMS-SC generates the necessary CDR information and includes the AF Identifier. The SMS Application port ID, which is included in the SM User Data Header and the Trigger Indication are included in the CDRs in order to enable differentiated charging. The SMS-SC stores the trigger payload, without routing information. If the message delivery fails and is attempted to be delivered again, UDM interrogation will be performed. If the message delivery fails and the validity period of this trigger message is not set to zero, the SMS-SC shall send a SM Message Delivery Status Report to request the UDM to add the SMS-SC address to the Message Waiting list. When the message delivery is later re-attempted, a new UDM interrogation will be performed by the SMS-GMSC using SUPI or MSISDN. UDM interrogations using SUPI shall not be forwarded or relayed to SMS-Router or IP-SM-GWs. The UDM may include up to four serving node identities (MSC or MME, SGSN, IP-SM-GW, AMF) in the response to SMS-GMSC.\n12.\tIf the message delivery fails (either directly or when validity period of the trigger message expires) or when the message delivery succeeds, the SMS-SC shall send a Message Delivery Report (cause code, trigger reference number, AF Identifier) to the NEF.\n13.\tThe NEF provides a Nnef_Trigger_DeliveryNotify message to the AF with a Delivery Report indicating the trigger delivery outcome (e.g. succeeded, unknown or failed and the reason for the failure).

The \"SMS supported\" indication indicates whether the UE supports SMS delivery over NAS.\n2.\tStep 4 to step 14 of the Registration procedure in Figure 4.2.2.2.2-1 are performed. The AMF may retrieve the SMS Subscription data and UE Context in SMSF data using Nudm_SDM_Get. This requires that UDM may retrieve this information from UDR by Nudr_DM_Query. The UDM includes the SMSF information in the Nudm_SDM_Get response message if the stored SMSF belongs to the same PLMN of the AMF. After a successful response is received and if SMS service is allowed, the AMF subscribes to be notified using Nudm_SDM_Subscribe when the SMS Subscription data is modified and UDM may subscribe to UDR by Nudr_DM_Subscribe.\nThe AMF can also receive UE context information containing SMSF Information from old AMF. When AMF re-allocation happens during the Registration procedure, the old AMF transfers SMSF Information to the new AMF as part of UE context in step 5 of Figure 4.2.2.2.2-1.\nNOTE 1:\tThe AMF can, instead of the Nudm_SDM_Get service operation, use the Nudm_SDM_Subscribe service operation with an Immediate Report Indication that triggers the UDM to immediately return the subscribed data if the corresponding feature is supported by both the AMF and the UDM.\n3.\tIf the \"SMS supported\" indication is included in the Registration Request, the AMF checks in the SMS Subscription data that was received in step 2 whether the SMS service is allowed to the UE. If SMS service is allowed and the UE context received in step 2 includes an available SMSF of the serving PLMN, the AMF activates this SMSF Address and continues the registration procedure. If SMS service is allowed but an SMSF of the serving PLMN was not received in step 2, the AMF discovers and selects an SMSF to serve the UE as described in clause 6.3.10 of TS 23.501 [2].\n4.\tStep 15 to step 20 of the Registration procedure in Figure 4.2.2.2.2-1 are performed.\n5.\tThe AMF invokes Nsmsf_SMService_Activate service operation from the SMSF. The invocation includes AMF address, Access Type, RAT Type, Trace Requirements, GPSI (if available) and SUPI. AMF uses the SMSF Information derived from step 3. Trace Requirements is provided if it has been received by AMF as part of subscription data.\n6.\tThe SMSF discovers a UDM as described in clause 6.3.8 of TS 23.501 [2].\n7a.\tIf the UE context for the current Access Type already exists in the SMSF, the SMSF shall replace the old AMF address with the new AMF address.\nOtherwise, the SMSF considers this a Registration request from a new Access Type and the SMSF registers with the UDM using Nudm_UECM_Registration with Access Type. As a result, the UDM stores the following information: SUPI, SMSF identity, SMSF address, Access Type(s) in UE Context in SMSF data. The UDM may further store SMSF Information in UDR by Nudr_DM_Update (SUPI, Subscription Data, UE Context in SMSF data).\nIf the Nsmsf_SMService_Activate request contains two Access Types and one of them is already registered in the SMSF, the SMSF shall replace the old AMF address with the new AMF address for that Access Type. The SMSF shall then register the other Access Type with the UDM using Nudm_UECM_Registration request.\n7b-7c\tSMSF retrieves SMS Management Subscription data (e.g. SMS teleservice, SMS barring list) using Nudm_SDM_Get and this requires that UDM may get this information from UDR by Nudr_DM_Query (SUPI, Subscription Data, SMS Management Subscription data). After a successful response is received, the SMSF subscribes to be notified using Nudm_SDM_Subscribe when the SMS Management Subscription data is modified and UDM may subscribe to notifications from UDR by Nudr_DM_Subscribe.\nSMSF also creates a UE context to store the SMS subscription information and the AMF address that is serving this UE.\nNOTE 2:\tThe SMSF can, instead of the Nudm_SDM_Get service operation, use the Nudm_SDM_Subscribe service operation with an Immediate Report Indication that triggers the UDM to immediately return the subscribed data if the corresponding feature is supported by both the SMSF and the UDM.\n8.\tThe SMSF responds back to the AMF with Nsmsf_SMService_Activate service operation response message. The AMF stores the SMSF Information received as part of the UE context.\n9.\tThe AMF includes the \"SMS allowed\" indication to the UE in the Registration Accept message of step 21 of Figure 4.2.2.2.2-1 only after step 8 in which the AMF has received a positive indication from the selected SMSF.\nThe \"SMS allowed\" indication in the Registration Accept message indicates to the UE whether the network allows the SMS message delivery over NAS.",

      "content": "The call flow in Figure 4.13.4.2-1 describes the procedure for emergency services fallback.\nFigure 4.13.4.2-1: Emergency Services Fallback\n1.\tUE camps on E-UTRA or NR cell in the 5GS (in either CM-IDLE or CM-CONNECTED state).\n2.\tUE has a pending IMS emergency session request (e.g. voice) from the upper layers.\n3.\tIf the AMF has indicated support for emergency services using fallback via the Registration Accept message for the current RAT, the UE sends a Service Request message indicating that it requires emergency services fallback. The UE is not required to include the PDU Sessions that are not relevant for the emergency service in the List Of PDU Sessions to be Activated in the Service Request for the emergency service.\nNOTE 1:\tIf the UE includes PDU Sessions to be Activated in the Service Request for the emergency service, it will delay the Emergency Services Fallback procedure.\n4.\t5GC triggers a request for Emergency Services Fallback by executing an NG-AP procedure in which it indicates to NG-RAN that this is a fallback for emergency services. The AMF based on the support of Emergency Services in EPC or 5GC may indicate the target CN for the RAN node to know whether inter-RAT fallback or inter-system fallback is to be performed. When AMF initiates Redirection for UE(s) that have been successfully authenticated, AMF includes the security context in the request to trigger fallback towards NG-RAN.\n5.\tBased on the target CN if indicated in message 4 or otherwise based on the RAN configuration, one of the following procedures is executed by NG-RAN:\n5a.\tNG-RAN initiates handover (see clause 4.9.1.3) or redirection to a 5GC-connected E-UTRAN cell, if UE is currently camped on NR.\n5b. NG-RAN initiates handover (see clause 4.11.1.2.1) or redirection to E-UTRAN connected to EPS. NG-RAN uses the security context provided by the AMF to secure the redirection procedure.\nIf the redirection procedure is used either in 5a or 5b the target CN type (EPC or 5GC) is also conveyed to the UE in order to be able to perform the appropriate NAS procedures (S1 or N1 Mode). The UE uses the emergency indication in the RRC message as specified in clause 6.2.2 of TS 36.331 [16] and E-UTRAN provides the emergency indication to AMF (during Registration triggered by step 5a) and MME (during Tracking Area Update triggered by step 5b). Both the Registration and the Tracking Area Update requests should contain Follow-on request and active flag respectively to indicate that the UE has \"user data pending\". For the handover procedure used in step 5b see clause 4.11.1.2.1, step 1.\nIn step 5b, if the MME does not support emergency services for that UE, the MME should act such that the call for emergency service is likely to succeed promptly, e.g. if the UE successfully completed a combined TA/LA Update with the network, by using the CSFB procedures specified in TS 23.272 [61].\nNOTE 2:\tIf such a combined TA/LA Update is not successful, or the UE did not request a combined update, then, as specified in TS 23.167 [28], the UE autonomously selects a RAT that may (but which might not) support the CS domain.\n6.\tAfter handover or redirection to the target cell the UE establishes a PDU Session / PDN connection for IMS emergency services and performs the IMS procedures for establishment of an IMS emergency session (e.g. voice) as defined in TS 23.167 [28].\nAt least for the duration of the emergency voice call, the E-UTRAN connected to EPC is configured to not trigger any handover to 5GS and the target NG-RAN is configured to not trigger inter NG-RAN handover back to source NG-RAN.",

The Event Filter Information is provided per Event ID(s) being subscribed to: within a subscription different Event ID(s) may be associated with different Event Filter Information.\n-\tEvent Reporting Information described in the Table 4.15.1-1 below. Within a subscription all Event ID(s) are associated with a unique Event Reporting Information.\n-\tTarget of Event Reporting: this may indicate a specific UE or PDU Session, a group of UE(s) or any UE (i.e. all UEs), Within a subscription all Event ID (s) are associated with the same Target of Event Reporting (possibly corresponding to multiple UE or multiple PDU Sessions).\n-\tA Notification Target Address (+ Notification Correlation ID) allowing the Event Receiving NF to correlate notifications received from the Event provider with this subscription. A subscription is associated with an unique Notification Target Address (+ Notification Correlation ID). In the case that the NF consumer subscribes to the NF producer on behalf of other NF, the NF consumer includes the Notification Target Address(+Notification Correlation ID) of other NF for the Event ID which is to be notified to other NF directly and the Notification Target Address(+Notification Correlation ID) of itself for the Subscription change related event notification. Each Notification Target Address(+ Notification Correlation ID) is associated with related (set of) Event ID(s).\n-\tAn Expiry time represents the time upto which the subscription is desired to be kept as active. The NF service consumer may suggest an Expiry time and provide to the NF service producer. Based on the operator's policy, the NF service producer decides whether the subscription can be expired. If the subscription can be expired, the NF service producer determines the Expiry time and provide it in the response to the NF service consumer. If the event subscription is about to expire based on the received Expiry time and the NF service consumer wants to keep receiving notifications, the NF service consumer update the subscription with the NF service producer in order to extend the Expiry time. Once the Expiry time associated with the subscription is reached, the subscription becomes invalid at the NF service producer. If the NF service consumer wants to keep receiving notifications, it shall create a new subscription with the NF service producer.\nWhen the subscription is accepted by the Event provider NF, the consumer NF receives from the event provider NF an identifier (Subscription Correlation ID) allowing to further manage (modify, delete) this subscription.\nNOTE 1:\tThe Notification Correlation ID is allocated by the consumer NF that subscribes to event reporting and the Subscription Correlation ID is allocated by the NF that notifies when the event is met. Both correlation identifiers can be assigned the same value, although in principle they are supposed to be different, as they are optimized for finding the subscription related context within each NF.\nThe consumer NF may use an operation dedicated to subscription modification to add or remove Event ID(s) to this subscription or to modify Event Filter Information.\nEvents are subscribed by the consumer NF(s) by providing Event Filters. The contents of the Event Reporting Information along with the presence requirement of each information element is described in Table 4.15.1-1.\nTable 4.15.1-1: Event Reporting Information\nEvent Reporting Information Parameter\nDescription\nPresence requirement\nEvent reporting mode\nMode of reporting - e.g. reporting up to a maximum number of reports, periodic reporting along with periodicity, variable reporting periodicity, reporting up to a maximum duration, reporting when threshold is reached.\nmandatory\n(see NOTE 7)\nMaximum number of reports\nMaximum number of reports after which the event subscription ceases to exist.\n(see NOTE 1)\nMaximum duration of reporting\nMaximum duration after which the event subscription ceases to exist.\n(see NOTE 1)\nImmediate reporting flag\nThe Event provider NF notifies the current status of the subscribed event, if available, immediately to the consumer NF.\nVariable reporting periodicity information (0..N)\nList of variable measurement information.\n(see NOTE 7)\n> Reporting periodicity\nReporting periodicity.\n(see NOTE 7)\n>Condition\nThe corresponding condition related to Reporting periodicity e.g. load of NF service producer.\n(see NOTE 7)\nSampling ratio\nPercentage of sampling (1%..100%) among impacted UEs.\noptional\n(see NOTE 2)\nPartitioning criteria\nCriteria for partitioning UEs before applying sampling ratio.\noptional\n(see NOTE 2)\nGroup Reporting Guard Time\nParameter for group-based monitoring configuration to indicate the time for which the Monitoring Event Reporting(s) related with the UEs in a group can be aggregated before sending them to the consumer NF.\nOptional\nDeactivate notification flag\nIndicates to the Event provider NF that the notification of the available events shall be muted until the Event consumer NF provides the retrieval notification flag to retrieve the events stored.\nOptional (see NOTE 8)\nRetrieval notification flag\nIndicates to the Event provider NF to send the notification to the Event consumer NF with the stored events and mutes again the notification of future events.\nOptional (see NOTE 8)\nMuting Exception Instructions\nIndicates to an Event provider NF instructions for the subscription and stored events when an exception (e.g. full buffer) occurs at the Event provider.\nOptional\n(see NOTE 6 and NOTE 8)\nGranularity of dynamics\nThe maximum amount of dynamics in the event which allows to skip an event notification.\noptional\n(see NOTE 3)\nReporting type\nEvent provider NF reports only when the events differs from the previously notified event.\noptional\n(see NOTE 4)\nReporting Threshold\nThreshold values indicate conditions on the level to be reached for the reporting.\nOptional\n(see NOTE 5)\nNOTE 1:\tThe requester shall include 2) Maximum number of reports or 3) Maximum duration of reporting, or both, depending on 1) Event reporting mode.\nNOTE 2:\tParameter only applicable to certain event IDs reporting metrics (e.g. Number of UEs present in a geographical area) used and used e.g. by the NWDAF for data collection.\nNOTE 3:\tThe Granularity of dynamics includes 1) the range of scalar value, 2) the list of events identification, or 3) the previous notification. The range of scalar value is only applicable to the event depicted as number (e.g. the number of UE), the others is applicable to the event depicted as identification (e.g. UE location, UE identification).\nNOTE 4:\tThe differences in event includes the events have been newly appeared, disappeared and changed from the previous notification.\nNOTE 5:\tThis parameter is included only if the Event reporting mode indicates reporting when threshold is reached.\nNOTE 6:\tThis parameter is included only if the \"Deactivate notification flag\" is set.\nNOTE 7:\tIf the requester includes \"variable reporting periodicity\", then reporting periodicity changes depending on e.g. load of NF service producer; otherwise the reporting periodicity is fixed.\nNOTE 8:\tThe support of this parameter is only required for services where NWDAF and/or DCCF are among the example consumers. It is expected that this parameter is used only if the Event Consumer NF is NWDAF or DCCF.\nNOTE 2:\tExplicit unsubscribe by the NF consumer is still possible.\nMaximum number of reports is applicable to the subscription to one UE or a group of UE(s). When the subscription is applied to a group of UE(s), the initial value of the parameter is applied to each individual member UE. The count of number of reports is per UE and per Event Type granularity also for group member UE.\nMaximum duration of reporting is applicable to the subscription to one UE, a group of UE(s) or any UE. When the subscription is applied to a group of UE(s), this parameter applies to each group member UE. When the subscription is applied to any UE, this parameter applies to all the impacted UEs.\nIf for a given subscription Maximum duration of reporting is included then the subscription is cancelled locally in the NF as soon as Maximum duration of reporting is reached. If the Maximum number of reports is reached for a given subscription, the NEF cancels the subscription in the affected NFs. If both Maximum Number of reports and Maximum duration of reporting are included then the subscription expires or is cancelled as soon as one of the conditions is met.\nSampling ratio is applicable to subscription targeting a group of UEs or any UE. When a sampling ratio is provided, a random subset is selected among the target UEs according to the sampling ratio and only the events related to this subset are reported. A UE remains selected until it is no longer managed by the event provider NF. A UE newly managed by the NF may be selected.\nPartitioning criteria are applicable to subscription targeting a group of UEs or any UE and may be used when sampling ratio is used. These criteria are used to instruct the NF on how to group the UEs before applying the sampling ratio. When partitioning criteria are provided, the NF groups the targeted UEs (i.e. creates sub-populations/strata) based on the partition criteria parameter. Then, from each sub-population/stratum, the NF selects a subset of UEs by sampling randomly from each sub-population according to the sampling ratio. For a given type of partitioning criteria, the UE belongs to a single sub-population/stratum as long as it is served by the NF. The types of Partitioning Criteria are described in Table 4.15.1-2:\nTable 4.15.1-2: Types of Partitioning Criteria\nTypes of Partitioning Criteria\nType Allocation Code\nSubscriber PLMN ID\nGeographical area, i.e. list(s) of TAI(s)\nS-NSSAI\nDNN\nGroup Reporting Guard Time is an optional parameter for group-based monitoring configuration to indicate the time for which the Monitoring Event Reporting(s) related with the UEs in a group can be aggregated before sending them to the consumer NF. The value of the Group Reporting Guard time should be set less than the Maximum duration of reporting. For the continuous monitoring reporting, unless the Maximum duration of reporting has been reached, the Group Reporting Guard timer is restarted when it expires. If the time left until the Maximum duration of reporting is less than the Group Reporting Guard Time, then the Group Reporting Guard timer shall be set to expire when the Maximum duration of reporting expires. If the Maximum duration of reporting is expired, the Group Reporting Guard Time, if running, shall be considered to expire and aggregated Monitoring Event Reporting(s) is sent to destination immediately.\nDeactivation notification flag and retrieval notification flag enable the mute storage of events for a limited size of events at the Event provider NF, thus reducing the number of notifications and the overall signalling between the Event provider NF and the Event consumer NF. Usage of these parameters is further specified in clause 6.2.7 of TS 23.288 [50].\nMuting Exception Instructions specify actions to be taken by the Event provider NF if the Deactivation notification flag is set and an exception occurs at the Event Producer NF (e.g. the Event provider can no longer buffer notifications because storage space is no longer available). The actions are specified in clause 6.2.7 of TS 23.288 [50].\nGranularity of dynamics indicates negligible changes in the target event of the subscription for which notification is not required. The changes in the Granularity of dynamics are depicted as the range of scalar value (x, y) where it means [the previously notified scalar value - x, the previously notified scalar value + y), the list of event identification(s) (e.g. list of SUPI(s)), or the previous notification. If the Granularity of dynamics is provided, the provider NF shall send the notification only when the changes in the target event are not described in the Granularity of dynamics, except for the first notification.\nReporting type is a parameter to reduce the data volume of notification. If the Reporting type is provided, the provider NF shall notify the events that have been newly appeared, disappeared and changed compared to the previous notification, except for the first notification.\nTable 4.15.1-1 indicates the presence requirements for the Event Reporting Information.\nCorresponding notifications contain at least the Notification Correlation ID together with the Event ID and the individual target (e.g. UE or PDU Session ID) associated with the notification.\nIf the NF service consumer decides to terminate the event subscription, it unsubscribes the event subscription by sending an unsubscribe request to the event provider NF. After receiving an unsubscribe request from the NF service consumer, the event provider NF terminates the event subscription.\nIf the NF service consumer has subscribed to group-based monitoring, then the NF service consumer may subsequently unsubscribe to the whole group or one or more identified group member UEs. Such partial cancellation of group-based monitoring does not affect the other group member UEs, but it only cancels the monitoring event subscription for the identified group member UEs. Partial cancellation of group-based monitoring can be caused by the following reasons:\n-\tUE's subscription is discontinued in the UDM;\n-\tUE's authorisation to the subscribed event type is revoked;\n-\tThe subscribing NF explicitly unsubscribes to monitoring of selected UE(s); or\n-\tUE is removed from the monitoring target group that was identified in monitoring subscription.\nIf the NF service consumer has subscribed to group-based monitoring and later new group member UEs are added to the group, then the NF service consumer may also subsequently add monitoring event subscription for the new group member UEs.\nThe following clauses describe the external exposure of network capabilities and core network internal event and capability exposure.\nWhen the immediate reporting flag is set, the first corresponding event report is included in the subscription response message, if corresponding information is available at the reception of the subscription request of the event.\nDuring Monitoring Event Subscription as in clause 4.15.3, Parameter Provisioning as in clause 4.15.6, NIDD configuration as in clause 4.25.3 and Enhanced Coverage Restriction Control as in clause 4.27.1, the optional parameter MTC Provider Information is a reference parameter that may be provided by AF or determined by NEF based on which AF it communicates with. The MTC Provider Information identifies the MTC Service Provider and/or MTC Application.\nNOTE 3:\tThe MTC Provider Information can be used by Service Providers for, e.g. to distinguish their different customers.\nNOTE 4:\tThe MTC Provider Information is an optional parameter. The NEF can validate the provided MTC Provider Information and override it to a NEF selected MTC Provider Information based on configuration. How the NEF determines the MTC Provider Information, if not present, is left to implementation (e.g. based on the requesting AF).",

      "content": "The Monitoring Events feature is intended for monitoring of specific events in 3GPP system and making such monitoring events information reported via the NEF. It is comprised of means that allow NFs in 5GS for configuring the specific events, the event detection and the event reporting to the requested party.\nTo support monitoring features in roaming scenarios, a roaming agreement needs to be made between the HPLMN and the VPLMN. If the AMF/SMF in the VPLMN determine that normalisation of an event report is required, the AMF/SMF normalises the event report before sending it to the NEF.\nThe set of capabilities required for monitoring shall be accessible via NEF to NFs in 5GS. Monitoring Events via the UDM, the AMF, the SMF, the NSACF and the GMLC enables NEF to configure a given Monitor Event at UDM, AMF, SMF, NSACF or GMLC and reporting of the event via UDM and/or AMF, SMF, NSACF or GMLC. Depending on the specific monitoring event or information, it is the AMF, GMLC, NSACF or the UDM that is aware of the monitoring event or information and makes it reported via the NEF.\nThe following table enumerates the monitoring events and their detection criteria:\nTable 4.15.3.1-1: List of events for monitoring capability\nEvent\nDetection criteria\nWhich NF detects the event\nLoss of Connectivity\nNetwork detects that the UE is no longer reachable for either signalling or user plane communication (see NOTE 4).\nThe AF may provide a Maximum Detection Time, which indicates the maximum period of time without any communication with the UE after which the AF is to be informed that the UE is considered to be unreachable (see NOTE 7).\nIf Unavailability Period Duration has been provided by the UE, the AMF uses the remaining value of it to determine the foreseen Loss of Connectivity time as described in clause 5.4.1.4 of TS 23.501 [2].\nAMF\nUE reachability\nDetected when the UE transitions to CM-CONNECTED state or when the UE will become reachable for paging, e.g. Periodic Registration Update timer. It indicates when the UE becomes reachable for sending downlink data to the UE.\nThe AF may provide the following parameters:\n1)\tMaximum Latency;\n2)\tMaximum Response Time;\n3)\tSuggested number of downlink packets. (see NOTE 5 and NOTE 7).\nThis event requires the Reachability Filter set to UE reachable for DL traffic\" (see clause 5.2.2.3.1-1). For the usage of this event, see clauses 4.2.5.2 and 4.2.5.3.\nWhen requesting UE reachability monitoring, the AF may in addition request Idle Status Indication to be included in the UE reachability event reporting.\nAMF, UDM\nLocation Reporting\nThis event is detected based on the Event Reporting Information Parameters that were received in the Monitoring Request (one-time reporting, maximum number of reports, maximum duration of reporting, periodicity, etc. as specified in clause 4.15.1).\nIt reports either the Current Location or the Last Known Location of a UE.\nWhen AMF is the detecting NF:\nOne-time and Continuous Location Reporting are supported. For Continuous Location Reporting the serving node(s) sends a notification every time it becomes aware of a location change, with the granularity depending on the accepted accuracy of location (see NOTE 1).\nFor One-time Reporting with immediate reporting flag set, AMF reports the Last Known Location immediately.\nWhen AMF is the detecting NF:\nIf the immediate reporting flag is not set, the AMF reports the UE Current Location (In case the AMF does not have the UE current location in the granularity as requested by the location report, the AMF retrieves the information via NG-RAN Location reporting procedure as defined in clause 4.10).\nWhen GMLC is the detecting NF:\nImmediate and Deferred Location Reporting is supported. For Deferred Location Reporting the event types UE availability, Area, Periodic Location and Motion are supported.\nAMF, GMLC\nChange of SUPI-PEI association\nThis event is detected when the association between PEI and subscription (SUPI) changes (USIM change).\nUDM\nRoaming status\nThis event is detected based on the UE's current roaming status (the serving PLMN and/or whether the UE is in its HPLMN) and notification is sent when that status changes. (see NOTE 2).\nIf the UE is registered via both 3GPP and N3GPP Access Type, then both instances of Roaming status are included.\nUDM\nCommunication failure\nThis event is detected when RAN or NAS level failure is detected based on connection release and it identifies RAN/NAS release code.\nAMF\nAvailability after Downlink Data Notification failure\nThis event is detected when the UE becomes reachable again after downlink data delivery failure.\nWhen requesting Availability after Downlink Data Notification failure monitoring, the AF may in addition request Idle Status Indication to be included in the UE reachability event reporting.\nAMF\nPDU Session Status\nThis event is detected when PDU session is established or released. (see NOTE 6)\nSMF\nNumber of UEs present in a geographical area\nThis event is detected based on the Event Reporting Information Parameters that were received in the Monitoring Request (Level of aggregation, Sampling ratio, see clause 4.15.1).\nIt indicates the number of UEs that are in the geographical area described by the AF. The AF may ask for the UEs that the system knows by its normal operation to be within the area (Last Known Location) or the AF may request the system to also actively look for the UEs within the area (Current Location).\nAMF\nCN Type change\nThe event is detected when the UE moves between EPC and 5GC. It indicates the current CN type for a UE or a group of UEs when detecting that the UE switches between being served by a MME and an AMF or when accepting the event subscription. (see NOTE 3)\nUDM\nDownlink data delivery status\nIt indicates the downlink data delivery status in the core network. Events are reported at the first occurrence of packets being buffered, transmitted or discarded, including:\n-\tDownlink data in extended buffering, including:\n-\tFirst data packet buffered event\n-\tEstimated buffering time, as per clause 4.2.3.3\n-\tFirst downlink data transmitted event\n-\tFirst downlink data discarded event\nSMF\nUE reachability for SMS delivery\nFor SMS over NAS, this event is detected when an SMSF is registered for a UE and the UE is reachable as determined by the AMF and the UDM.\nFor SMS over IP, the event is detected when the UE is reachable as determined by the AMF and the UDM regardless of an SMSF being registered.\nThis enables the UE to receive an SMS. See clauses 4.2.5.2 and 4.2.5.3 (see NOTE 8).\nUDM\nUE memory available for SMS\nThis event is detected when the UDM receives UE memory available for SMS indication from the SMSF as part of Alert procedure as specified in clause 5.1.8 of TS 23.540 [84]\nUDM\nNumber of registered UEs or established PDU Sessions\nIt indicates the current number of registered UEs or established PDU Sessions for a network slice that is subject to NSAC.\nFor One-time Reporting with Immediate Reporting Flag set, NSACF reports the number of registered UEs or established PDU Sessions immediately.\nNSACF\nArea Of Interest\nIt indicates change of the UE presence in the Area Of Interest.\nAMF, GMLC\nGroup Member List Change\nIt indicates the changes on the members of the group.\nThis event apply to a group of UEs (identified by an External Group ID), such as 5G VN group (see NOTE 9) or other groups.\nUDM\nSession inactivity time\nThis event is detected by the SMF when the PDU Session has no data transfer for a period specified by the Inactivity Timer. via the User plane status information event, see clause 5.2.8.3.1.\nSMF\nTraffic volume\nThis event measures the traffic volume (UL and DL) aggregated for the PDU Session (NOTE 10).\nUPF\nUL/DL data rate\nThis event measures the data rate (UL and DL) aggregated for the PDU Session (NOTE 10).\nUPF\nApplication Detection\nDetection of application start or stop\n(See NOTE 11), as described in clause 6.1.3.18 of TS 23.503 [20].\nPCF\nNOTE 1:\tLocation granularity for event request, or event report, or both could be at cell level (Cell ID) or TA level.

The procedure handles the case when there is a single NSACF in the PLMN responsible for the S-NSSAI (single Service Area) or when there are multiple NSACFs responsible for the S-NSSAI in the PLMN (multiple Service Areas).\nFigure 4.15.3.2.10.1-1: Reported value(s) aggregated at NEF per network slice notification procedure\n1.\tTo subscribe or unsubscribe for the number of UEs or the number of PDU Sessions per network slice notification with the NEF, the AF sends Nnef_EventExposure Subscribe/Unsubscribe Request (Event ID, Event Filter, Event Reporting information, S-NSSAI) message to the NEF. The Event ID parameter defines the subscribed event ID, i.e. Number of Registered UEs or Number of Established PDU Sessions. The Event Filter parameter defines the S-NSSAI, in case of a trusted AF or AF-Service-Identifier as defined in TS 29.522 [87] for an untrusted AF, for which reporting is required. The Event Reporting information parameter defines the mode of reporting, which includes threshold reporting with a threshold value or periodic reporting with included periodicity time interval. The S-NSSAI is the slice for which the subscription is requested\nThe AF may request one-time reporting or immediate reporting.\nNOTE 1:\tWhen immediate reporting but not for one-time reporting is requested, the subscription is maintained after returning the report to the AF. When one-time reporting is requested, the subscription is terminated right after returning the report to the AF.\nNotifications related to the threshold based subscriptions behave as follows:\n-\tA single notification is sent only when the number of registered UEs or the number of established PDU Sessions reaches the threshold. A single notification is sent every time there is a change from being below the threshold to reach the threshold.\n-\tA single notification is sent only once when the number of registered UEs or the number of established PDU Sessions go below the threshold after reaching it. A single notification is sent every time there is a change from reaching the threshold to coming down below the threshold.\n2.\tThe NEF confirms with Nnef_EventExposure_Subscribe/Unsubscribe Response message to the AF. This message may include the event reporting, if available in the NEF and immediate reporting or one-time reporting was requested by the AF. In the case of Untrusted AF, the NEF includes the AF-Service-Identifier corresponding to the S-NSSAI in the returned notification.\nIf immediate reporting or one-time reporting is requested, step 2 occurs after step 5 and the subscription response contains the immediate or one-time report. For the case of one-time reporting, no subscription is created at the NEF/NSACF.\n3.\tThe NEF may query the NRF to find the NSACF(s) responsible for the requested S-NSSAI. If needed, the NEF translates the AF-Service-Identifier to the corresponding S-NSSAI prior to performing the query.\n4.\tIf the NEF has not already subscribed to the event from the NSACF for the requested S-NSSAI, the NEF initiates the request Nnsacf_SliceEventExposure_Subscribe/Unsubscribe Request (Event ID, Event Filter, Event Reporting information, immediate reporting, S-NSSAI) to all the NSACFs supporting the requested S-NSSAI. The NEF stores the AF requested Event Reporting Information. If multiple NSACFs are selected for the requested S-NSSAI, the NEF may set the Event Reporting Information to periodic in its request to the NSACFs. If single NSACF is selected, the NEF sets the Event Reporting Information identical to the received request from the AF. The NEF also sets the Event ID and Event Filter identical to the received request from the AF\nNOTE 2:\tThe period chosen is selected by the NEF based on its internal logic.\n5.\tThe NSACF(s) confirms with Nnsacf_SliceEventExposure_Subscribe/Unsubscribe Response message to the NEF. This message may include the event reporting if available at NSACF and immediate reporting or one-time reporting was requested by the NEF.\n6.\tWhen the reporting condition for a subscribed event is fulfilled, the NSACF triggers a notification towards the NEF.\n7.\tThe NSACF sends the Nnsacf_SliceEventExposure_Notify (Event ID, Event Reporting information) message to the NEF. If the subscription is for event based notification (e.g. based on the monitored event reaching a threshold value), the Event Reporting information parameter contains confirmation for the event fulfilment. If the subscription is for periodic notification or for immediate reporting, the Event Reporting information parameter provides information for the current number of UEs registered with a network slice (e.g. represented in percentage of the maximum number of the UEs registered with the network slice) or information for the current number of PDU Sessions on a network slice (e.g. represented in percentage of the maximum number of the UEs established on the network slice).\n8.\tWhen a single NSACF is returned from the discovery procedure, the NEF sends the Nnef_EventExposure_Notify (Event ID, Event Reporting information) message since the reporting condition is fulfilled. In the case of Untrusted AF, the NEF includes the AF-Service-Identifier corresponding to the S-NSSAI in the returned notification.\n9.\tWhen multiple NSACFs are selected for the requested NSSAI the NEF performs the aggregation from reporting NSACF(s) and maintain the overall usage of the S-NSSAI for the selected NSACFs as long as the subscription is active.\nNOTE 3:\tIf multiple NSACFs are selected for the requested S-NSSAI, the NEF continuously updates the aggregated information to be able to fulfil the incoming subscription request from the AF.\n10.\tWhen multiple NSACFs are selected for the requested S-NSSAI and when the reporting condition for a subscribed event by the AF is fulfilled, the NEF sends Nnef_EventExposure_Notify (Event ID, Event Reporting information) message towards the AF. In case of untrusted AF; the NEF includes the AF-Service-Identifier corresponding to the S-NSSAI in the returned notification.\nIf the hierarchical NSAC architecture is deployed in the PLMN for the NSAC of an S-NSSAI and the number of UEs, number of UE with at least one PDU session/PDN connection, or number of PDU Sessions are aggregated at NEF, the same procedure as above can be reused. In this case Primary NSACF behaves as a normal NSACF.\n4.15.3.2.10.2\tReported value(s) aggregated at Primary NSACF\nIf the hierarchical NSAC architecture is deployed in the PLMN for the NSAC of an S-NSSAI, the Primary NSACF needs to be aware of the current status of registered UEs, UE with at least one PDU session/PDN connection, or established PDU sessions at all NSACFs with whom it is interacting, so it can dynamically adapt and adjust the local Maximum number of UEs, local Maximum number of UE with at least one PDU session/PDN connection, or PDU sessions configured at the NSACFs. In this case, it is possible to leverage this capability and provide subscribing AFs to receive the registered number of UEs, number of UE with at least one PDU session/PDN connection, or the number of PDU sessions for the requested S-NSSAI without NEF aggregation. Such a procedure is depicted below.\nFigure 4.15.3.2.10.2-1: Reported value(s) aggregated at Primary NSACF per network slice notification procedure\n1.\tThe AF subscribes (or unsubscribe) to the number of UEs, or the number of PDU Sessions per network slice notification to the NEF. The NEF finds the primary NSACF responsible for the requested S-NSSAI. Based on the network configuration, the NEF does not to do the aggregation. The procedure is same as steps 1-5 of clause 4.15.3.2.10.1 with the following differences:\n-\tBased on the network configuration the NEF is aware that one NSACF can serve entire PLMN for the requested S-NSSAI, i.e. existence of the Primary NSACF. The NEF queries the NRF to find the corresponding primary NSACF responsible for the requested S-NSSAI. Besides the requested S-NSSAI, the Serving Area information of \"Entire PLMN\" is included as querying parameter. In the case of Trusted AF, the AF can discover and subscribe (or unsubscribe) directly with the Primary NSACF.\n-\tThe NEF sets the Event Reporting Information identical to the received request from the AF. The NEF also sets the Event ID and Event Filter identical to the received request from the AF. The Primary NSACF responsible for the requested S-NSSAI performs the aggregation per network configuration.\n2-6.\tThe Primary NSACF subscribes (or unsubscribes) to the number of UEs, or the number of PDU Sessions per network slice notification to all the NSACFs supporting the requested S-NSSAI(s). The procedure is same as steps 4-7 of clause 4.15.3.2.10.1 for multiple NSACFs case with the Primary NSACF replacing the NEF and the following differences:\n-\tStep 2, based on the received event subscription from NEF, the Primary NSACF triggers the slice event subscription to NSACF(s) if it does not exist before.\n-\tStep 6, the Primary NSACF performs the aggregated values from reporting NSACF(s) including itself (if available) and maintain the overall usage of the S-NSSAI(s) for the indicated Event ID parameter, i.e. the number of UEs registered with a network slice, number of UE with at least one PDU session/PDN connection, or the number of PDU Sessions established on a network slice, from the selected NSACFs as long as the subscription is active. When the reporting condition for a subscribed event is fulfilled, the Primary NSACF triggers a notification for the event towards the NEF. As values from the NSACF(s) has been aggregated at the Primary NSACF, there is no aggregation to be performed further at the NEF. NEF forwards the received values to AF.\nNOTE:\tFor the number of registered UEs per network slice or number of UE with at least one PDU session/PDN connection, the aggregated value includes both the number of registered UE at NSACF(s) and the number of registered UE at Primary NASCF as described in the clause 5.15.11.1.2 of TS 23.501 [2]. For the number of established PDU sessions per network slice, the aggregated value only includes the number of established PDU Sessions at the NSACF(s).",

When the Subscription request for QoS monitoring event indicates that it is for the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule, based on local configuration the subscription request may trigger SMF to enable QoS monitoring.\nNOTE 1:\tPackets from multiple applications may share the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS Rule which may diminish the relevance of some measurements like data rate.\nThe subscription to QoS monitoring event can target the QoS flows bound to an application by including an Application Identifier. In this case, at subscription request and/or when the PCC rules change, SMF identifies the active PCC Rule that includes a DataCollection_ApplicationIdentifier matching that Application Identifier. SMF enables this consumer (e.g. NWDAF) to receive the QoS Monitoring reports enabled by that PCC Rule. The consumer may indicate that it can receive QoS Flow Performance information for the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule if there are no measurements available for the Application Identifier (that is, if no PCC rule is identified). In this case the SMF may instruct the UPF to perform QoS monitoring for the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule and include the Indication of QoS Flow associated with the default QoS Rule (see clause 5.8.2.18 of TS 23.501 [2]). The UPF will then include the Indication of QoS Flow associated with the default QoS Rule in the Nupf_EventExposure_Notify service operation when sending reports. Otherwise, the SMF may accept the request and indicate in the response that reporting will be activated when the measurements are enabled by a PCC rule or the SMF may reject the subscription request for that Application Identifier.\nNOTE 2:\tExtensive usage of QoS Monitoring has significant impact on load and signalling.\nA consumer of UPF event exposure such as NWDAF may subscribe to User Data Usage events (i.e. User Data Usage Measures and User Data Usage Trends) directly to UPF (under the conditions defined in clause 5.8.2.17 of TS 23.501 [2]) or via SMF, and UPF sends the event notifications directly to this consumer. For these events, the interaction between SMF and UPF is over SBI. For User Data Usage events, the subscription request targets the traffic matching Event Filter Information (details are described in clause 5.2.26.2.1) for a user's PDU Session or for each PDU Session served by the UPF. The subscription request may indicate the granularity requested, that is whether the measurement reports should be provided per data flow, per application, or per PDU Session.\nIf the event notification can be delayed, i.e. delay tolerant, Reporting suggestion information is included. The Reporting suggestion information includes Report urgency and Reporting time information. Reporting urgency information indicates whether this event report can be delay tolerant, i.e. the event report can be delayed. If the Reporting urgency information indicates \"delay tolerant\", the Reporting time is also provided, which defines the last valid reporting time and UPF shall report the detected event before the last valid time.\nIf a consumer subscribes to an UPF event via the SMF including an AoI (\"Area of Interest\"), the SMF starts the subscription to the UPF only when the UE is located in the requested AoI. When the UE leaves the AoI, the SMF stops the subscription on the UPF. The SMF may subscribe to AMF about UE moving in or out of an AoI for this purpose. Clause 4.15.4.5.4 describes an alternative procedure for subscription via SMF to UPF event exposure service related with AOI.\nTable 4.15.4.5.1-1: Input parameters in subscription to UPF event Exposure events\nInformation\nTo SMF\nTo UPF\n(NOTE 4)\nUE identification (NOTE 5)\nY\nY\nAny UE\nY\nY\nDNN\nY\nY (NOTE 6)\nS-NSSAI\nY\nY (NOTE 6)\nAOI\nY\nN\nBSSID/SSID\nY\nN\nDNAI (NOTE 3)\nY\nN\nUPF Id (NOTE 3)\nY\nnot applicable\nType of Measurement\nY\nY\nGranularity of Measurement (NOTE 2)\nY\nY\nApplication ID (NOTE 1)\nY\nY\nTraffic Filtering Information (NOTE 1), (NOTE 2)\nY\nY\nReporting suggestion information\nY\nY\nNOTE 1:\tApplication ID and Traffic Filtering Information are exclusive.\nNOTE 2:\tThis parameter does not apply to QoS monitoring event.\nNOTE 3:\tThis parameter is used to indicate a UP Path as defined in Table 6.4.1-1 of TS 23.288 [50].\nNOTE 4:\tThis column is not applicable to events where SMF-UPF interactions are using PFCP (e.g. QoS Monitoring event).

The AMF may determine a Registration area based on parameters Stationary indication or Expected UE Moving Trajectory.\nIf the AMF obtains service area for a group or SUPI, the AMF configures the DNN for the group as LADN DNN and applies the LADN per DNN and S-NSSAI taking into account the service area for the group as described in clause 5.6.5a of TS 23.501 [2].\nb)\tIf the subscribed NF is SMF, the UDM performs Nudm_SDM_Notification (SUPI or Internal Group Identifier, SMF-Associated Expected UE Behaviour parameter set, DNN/S-NSSAI, Suggested Number of Downlink Packets, 5G VN group data, etc.) service operation.\nThe SMF stores the received parameters and associates them with a PDU Session based on the DNN and S-NSSAI included in the message from UDM.\nIf the SMF receives confidence and/or accuracy levels along the Expected UE behaviour parameter(s), the SMF may use the associated confidence level and/or accuracy level when handling the expected UE behaviour parameter(s). The SMF may use the parameters as follows:\n-\tSMF configures the UPF accordingly. The SMF can use the Scheduled Communication Type parameter or Suggested Number of Downlink Packets parameter to configure the UPF with how many downlink packets to buffer. The SMF may use Communication duration time parameter and/or Expected Inactivity Time parameter and/or Battery Indication parameter combined with their confidence and/or accuracy levels to set the inactivity timer for a PDU Session. The SMF then waits for a UP inactivity report to be received from UPF. Based on the received UP inactivity report, the SMF may determine to deactivate the corresponding UP connection associated to the PDU Session of a single UE or determine a collective pattern of deactivating UP connections for multiple UEs (e.g. for a group of UEs receiving application AI/ML traffic during FL operation) and perform CN-initiated selective deactivation of UP connection of an existing PDU Session.\n-\tThe SMF may derive SMF derived CN assisted RAN information for the PDU Session. The SMF provides the SMF derived CN assisted RAN information to the AMF as described in PDU Session establishment procedure or PDU Session modification procedure.\nNOTE 8:\tThe NEF (in NOTE 1) or the UDM (in step 3) can also update the corresponding UDR data via Nudr_DM_Create/Delete as appropriate.\nNOTE 9:\tThe change of AF provided ECS configuration information is not meant to apply immediately: the UDM interface to the SMF can refer to Shared Data for the Subscription provided ECS configuration information.\nNOTE 10:\tSpecification details of confidence and accuracy levels are left to Stage 3 work.",

      "content": "These Expected UE Behaviour parameters characterise the foreseen behaviour of a UE or a group of UEs. Sets of these parameters may be provided via the NEF to be stored as part of the subscriber data. Each parameter within the Expected UE Behaviour shall have an associated validity time. The validity time indicates when the Expected UE Behaviour parameter expires and shall be deleted by the related NFs. The validity time may be set to indicate that the particular Expected UE Behaviour parameter has no expiration time. When the validity time expires, the related NFs delete their local copy of the associated Expected UE Behaviour parameter(s). In addition, each parameter within the Expected UE Behaviour may have a confidence and/or accuracy level associated with it. The confidence level indicates a probability assertion for the associated Expected UE Behaviour parameter and the accuracy level indicates the performance of the estimator (e.g. AI/ML model) used for the prediction. The provision procedure of the Expected UE Behaviour is realized by external parameter provision procedure defined in clause 4.15.6.2.\nThe Expected UE Behaviour parameters stored as AMF-Associated Expected UE Behaviour parameters which is per UE level and SMF-Associated Expected UE Behaviour parameters which is per PDU session level in UDM. AMF retrieves the AMF-Associated Expected UE Behaviour parameters from UDM which may related to both PDU session(s) and SMS transmission. SMF retrieves the SMF-Associated Expected UE Behaviour parameters from UDM for the specific PDU session. AMF and SMF uses the Expected UE Behaviour parameters as described in clause 5.4.6.2 of TS 23.501 [2].\nTable 4.15.6.3-1: Description of Expected UE Behaviour parameters\nExpected UE Behaviour parameter\nDescription\nExpected UE Moving Trajectory\nIdentifies the UE's expected geographical movement\nExample: A planned path of movement\nStationary Indication\nIdentifies whether the UE is stationary or mobile [optional]\nCommunication Duration Time\nIndicates for how long the UE will normally stay in CM-CONNECTED for data transmission.\nExample: 5 minutes.\n[optional]\nPeriodic Time\nInterval Time of periodic communication\nExample: every hour.\n[optional]\nScheduled Communication Time\nTime and day of the week when the UE is available for communication.\nExample: Time: 13:00-20:00, Day: Monday.\n[optional]\nBattery Indication\nIdentifies power consumption criticality for the UE: if the UE is battery powered with not rechargeable/not replaceable battery, battery powered with rechargeable/replaceable battery, or not battery powered.\n[optional]\nTraffic Profile\nIdentifies the type of data transmission: single packet transmission (UL or DL), dual packet transmission (UL with subsequent DL or DL with subsequent UL), multiple packets transmission\n[optional]\nScheduled Communication Type\nIndicates that the Scheduled Communication Type is Downlink only or Uplink only or Bi-directional [To be used together with Scheduled Communication Time]\nExample: <Scheduled Communication Time>, DL only.\n[optional]\nExpected Time and Day of Week in Trajectory\nIdentifies the time and day of week when the UE is expected to be at each location included in the Expected UE Moving Trajectory.\n[optional]\nThe Expected UE Moving Trajectory and the Expected Time and Day of Week in Trajectory may be used by the AMF.

The UDM shall use the minimum value of Maximum Latency(s) to derive the subscribed periodic registration timer and use the maximum value of Maximum Response Time(s) to derive the subscribed Active Time as specified in step 2 of clause 4.15.3.2.3b. If the newly derived value is changed comparing to the one last time sent to the AMF, the UDM notify the AMF of the updated value via Nudm_SDM_Notification message. If there is a deletion of Network Configuration request, the UDM re-calculates the values (see step 2 in clause 4.15.3.2.3b) and notify the AMF if needed.\nThe Suggested Number of Downlink Packets is classified as SMF associated subscription data. If the NEF is providing DNN and S-NSSAI as specified in clause 4.15.3.2.3, then the UDM is able to associate the parameters with subscribed DNN and S-NSSAI and provides the Suggested Number of Downlink Packets consolidated as specified in 4.15.3.2.3b to the SMF for the PDU Session associated with the specific DNN and S-NSSAI as specified in clause 4.15.6.2. The SMF may use the Suggested Number of Downlink Packets parameter to configure the number of packets to buffer in the SMF/UPF (in the case of UPF anchored PDU sessions) or in the NEF (in the case of NEF anchored PDU session) when the UE is not reachable and extended buffering of downlink data is activated.\nA Validity Time may be associated with any of the Network Configuration parameters. When the validity time expires, the related NFs delete their local copy of the associated Network Configuration parameter(s).

Optionally, QoS monitoring requirements, Indication of ECN marking for L4S, PDU Set QoS Parameters (as described in clause 5.7.7 of TS 23.501 [2]) and Protocol Description (as described in clause 5.37.5 or 5.37.8.3 of TS 23.501 [2]) can be included in the AF request. For a Multi-modal service, the AF may provide a Multi-modal Service ID together with Multi-modal Service Requirements information for each data flow, as described in clause 6.1.3.27.3 of TS 23.503 [20]. Optionally, a period of time or a traffic volume for the requested QoS can be included in the AF request. The AF may, instead of a QoS Reference, provide one or more of the following individual QoS parameters: Requested 5GS Delay (optional), Requested Priority (optional), Requested Guaranteed Bitrate, Requested Maximum Bitrate, Maximum Burst Size and Requested Packet Error Rate. The AF may also provide an Averaging Window value for deriving such parameters for GBR QoS Flows. Regardless of whether the AF request is formulated using a QoS Reference or individual QoS parameters, the AF may also provide one or more of the following parameters that describe the traffic characteristics: flow direction, Burst Arrival Time at UE (uplink) or UPF (downlink), Periodicity, Time domain, Survival Time, Capability for BAT adaptation or BAT Window, Periodicity Range. The AF may also provide an RT Latency Indication. The optional Alternative Service Requirements provided by the AF shall either contain QoS References or Requested Alternative QoS Parameter Set(s) in a prioritized order as described in clause 6.1.3.22 of TS 23.503 [20]. Optionally, Packet Delay Variation requirements can be included in the AF request as described in clause 6.1.3.26 of TS 23.503 [20]. Optionally, the AF may provide QoS duration and QoS inactivity interval in order to indicate PCF the time period when the QoS should be applied.\nNOTE 1:\tFor multi-modal flows related to multiple UEs, multiple UE-specific AF requests are used and the AF provided information to NEF is the same as single UE case (as defined in clause 5.37.2 of TS 23.501 [2]).\n2.\tThe NEF authorizes the AF request that contains a single UE address and may apply policies to control the overall amount of QoS authorized for the AF. If the authorisation is not granted, all steps (except step 5) are skipped and the NEF replies to the AF with a Result value indicating that the authorisation failed. The NEF assigns a Transaction Reference ID to the Nnef_AFsessionWithQoS_Create request.\nThe NEF determines whether to invoke the TSCTSF or to directly contact the PCF based on operator configuration. This determination may use the presence of a QoS Reference or individual QoS parameters in the AF request. The determination may also use the AF identifier or the presence of AF provided parameters that describe the traffic characteristics in the AF request.\nNOTE 2:\tThe determination can also be based on an SLA between operator and application provider, e.g. using the DNN/S-NSSAI for the AF session according to the SLA.\nIf the NEF determines not to invoke the TSCTSF, then steps 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 are executed, otherwise, steps 3a, 3b, 4a, 4b, 5, 6a, 7a, 7b, 8 are executed.\n3.\tIf the NEF determines to contact the PCF directly without invoking the TSCTSF, the NEF uses the UE address to discover the PCF from the BSF. The NEF forwards received parameters to the PCF in the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create request. Any optionally received period of time or traffic volume mapped and forwarded as sponsored data connectivity information (as defined in TS 23.503 [20]).\nIf the AF is considered to be trusted by the operator, the AF uses the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create request message to interact directly with PCF to request reserving resources for an AF session.\n3a.\tIf the NEF determines to invoke the TSCTSF, the NEF forwards received parameters in the Ntsctsf_QoSandTSCAssistance_Create request message to the TSCTSF. Any optionally received period of time or traffic volume is mapped and forwarded as sponsored data connectivity information (as defined in TS 23.503 [20]).\nIf the AF is considered to be trusted by the operator, the AF uses the Ntsctsf_QoSandTSCAssistance_Create request message to interact directly with TSCTSF to request reserving resources for an AF session.\nA TSCTSF address may be locally configured (a single TSCTSF per DNN/S-NSSAI) in the NEF, PCF and trusted AF. Alternatively, the NEF uses the AF Identifier to determine the DNN/S-NSSAI and uses the DNN/S-NSSAI to discover the TSCTSF from the NRF.\n3b.\tThe TSCTSF determines whether it has an AF session with a PCF for the given UE address. In this case the TSCTSF sends a Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update request message to the PCF and forwards the received parameters after executing the adjustment and mapping actions described below.\nIf the TSCTSF does not have an AF-session for a given UE address, the TSCTSF discovers the PCF and a Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create request message to the PCF.\nIf the TSCTSF receives a Requested 5GS Delay, the TSCTSF calculates a Requested PDB by subtracting the UE-DS-TT Residence Time (either provided by the PCF or pre-configured at TSCTSF) from the Requested 5GS Delay and sends the Requested PDB to the PCF instead of the Requested 5GS Delay. If the TSCTSF receives any of the following parameters: flow direction, Burst Arrival Time, Periodicity, Time domain, Survival Time, Capability for BAT adaptation or BAT Window, Periodicity Range from the NEF, the TSCTSF determines the TSC Assistance Container and sends it to the PCF instead of these parameters.\n4.\tFor requests received from the NEF in step 3, the PCF determines whether the request is authorized and notifies the NEF if the request is not authorized.\nIf the request is authorized, the PCF derives the required QoS parameters of the PCC rule based on the information provided by the NEF and determines whether this QoS is allowed (according to the PCF configuration) and notifies the result to the NEF. If the AF is considered to be trusted by the operator, the PCF sends the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create response message directly to AF.\nIf the PCF receives the individual QoS parameters instead of QoS Reference, the PCF determines a 5QI that matches the individual QoS parameters as described in clause 6.1.3.22 of TS 23.503 [20]. It also sets the GBR and MBR for the PCC rule according to the requested values. The PCF may use the Requested Priority from the AF to determine Priority Level as defined in clause 5.7.3.3 of TS 23.501 [2]. Requested individual QoS parameter values supersede default values for the 5QI.\nIf the PCF receives the RT Latency Indication described in clause 6.1.3.22 of TS 23.503 [20], the PCF executes Uplink-Downlink Transmission Coordination as described in clause 5.37.7 of TS 23.501 [2] and the associated QoS monitoring for the two correlated QoS Flows as described in clause 6.1.3.27.2 of TS 23.503 [20].\nIf the PCF receives PDU Set QoS parameters described in clause 5.7.7 of TS 23.501 [2], the PDU Set QoS parameters are applied as described in clause 6.1.3.22 of TS 23.503 [20].\nIf the PCF receives an explicit indication (i.e. Indication of ECN marking for L4S) as described in clause 6.1.3.22 of TS 23.503 [20], PCF decides that the service data flow supports ECN marking for L4S. PCF then indicates to the SMF to enable ECN marking for L4S for that QoS flow.\nIn addition, if the Alternative Service Requirements are provided, the PCF derives the Alternative QoS parameter set(s) in the same way from the one or more QoS Reference parameters or the Requested Alternative QoS Parameter Set(s) contained in the Alternative Service Requirements keeping the same prioritized order (as defined in clause 6.1.3.22 of TS 23.503 [20]).\nNOTE 3:\tThe PCF derived Alternative QoS parameter set(s) for the PCC rule are subsequently used to establish Alternative QoS Profile(s). The Alternative QoS Profile parameters provided to the NG-RAN are specified in clause 5.7.1.2a of TS 23.501 [2].\nFor multi-modal flows, the PCF derives the required QoS parameters in the PCC rules and generates the QoS monitoring requirements policy for each media flow, based on the information provided by the NEF.\nIf the PCF determines that the SMF needs updated policy information, the PCF issues a Npcf_SMPolicyControl_UpdateNotify request with updated policy information about the PDU Session as described in the PCF initiated SM Policy Association Modification procedure in clause 4.16.5.2.\n4a.\tFor requests received from the TSCTSF in step 3b, the PCF determines whether the request is authorized and notifies the TSCTSF if the request is not authorized.\nIf the request is authorized, the PCF derives the required QoS parameters of the PCC rule in the same way it is described in step 4 based on the information provided by the TSCTSF and determines whether this QoS is allowed (according to the PCF configuration) and notifies the result to the TSCTSF.\nIf the PCF determines that the SMF needs updated policy information, the PCF issues a Npcf_SMPolicyControl_UpdateNotify request with updated policy information about the PDU Session as described in the PCF initiated SM Policy Association Modification procedure in clause 4.16.5.2.\nIf the PCF receives a subscription for the 5GS Bridge/Router information from the TSCTSF, if the PCF does not have the 5GS Bridge/Router information for the PDU Session, the PCF uses the PCF initiated SM Policy Association Modification procedure as described in clause 4.16.5.2 to subscribe for 5GS Bridge/Router information event from the SMF. Once the PCF has the 5GS Bridge/Router information, the PCF notifies the TSCTSF for the 5GS Bridge/Router information (including the UE-DS-TT Residence Time).\n4b.\tThe TSCTSF sends a Ntsctsf_QoSandTSCAssistance_Create response message (Transaction Reference ID, Result) to the NEF. Result indicates whether the request is granted or not.\nIf the AF is considered to be trusted by the operator, the TSCTSF sends the Ntsctsf_QoSandTSCAssistance_Create response message directly to AF.\n5.\tThe NEF sends a Nnef_AFsessionWithQoS_Create response message (Transaction Reference ID, Result) to the AF. Result indicates whether the request is granted or not.\n6.\tThe NEF shall send a Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Subscribe message to the PCF to subscribe to notifications of Resource allocation status and may subscribe to other events described in clause 6.1.3.18 of TS 23.503 [20].\n6a.\tThe TSCTSF shall send a Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Subscribe message to the PCF to subscribe to notifications of Resource allocation status and may subscribe to other events described in clause 6.1.3.18 of TS 23.503 [20].\nThe TSCTSF that receives Capability for BAT adaptation or BAT Window in step 3a shall subscribe to notification on BAT offset via sending a Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Subscribe request message to the PCF.\n7.\tWhen the event condition is met, e.g. that the establishment of the transmission resources corresponding to the QoS update succeeded or failed, the PCF sends Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Notify message to the NEF notifying about the event.\nIf the AF is considered to be trusted by the operator, the PCF sends the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Notify message directly to AF.\n7a.\tWhen the event condition is met, e.g. that the establishment of the transmission resources corresponding to the QoS update succeeded or failed, the PCF sends Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Notify message to the TSCTSF notifying about the event.\n7b.\tThe TSCTSF sends Ntsctsf_QoSandTSCAssistance_Notify message with the event reported by the PCF to the NEF.\nIf the AF is considered to be trusted by the operator, the TSCTSF sends the Ntsctsf_QoSandTSCAssistance_Notify message directly to AF.\n8.\tThe NEF sends Nnef_AFsessionWithQoS_Notify message with the event reported by the PCF to the AF.\nThe AF may send Nnef_AFsessionWithQoS_Revoke request to NEF in order to revoke the AF request. The NEF authorizes the revoke request and triggers the Ntsctsf_QoSandTSCAssistance_Delete and/or Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Delete service operations for the AF request.\n4.15.6.6a\tAF session with required QoS update procedure\nFigure 4.15.6.6a-1: AF session with required QoS update procedure\n1.\tFor an established AF session with required QoS, the AF may send a Nnef_AFsessionWithQoS_Update request message (AF Identifier, Transaction Reference ID, [Flow description information], [QoS Reference or individual QoS parameters], [Alternative Service Requirements (as described in clause 6.1.3.22 of TS 23.503 [20])]) to NEF for updating the reserved resources. Optionally, Indication of ECN marking for L4S, PDU Set QoS Parameters (as described in clause 5.7.7 of TS 23.501 [2]) and Protocol Description (as described in clause 5.37.5 or 5.37.8.3 of TS 23.501 [2]) can be included in the AF request. For a Multi-modal service, the AF may provide/update Multi-modal Service Requirements information of the existing data flows as described in clause 6.1.3.27.3 of TS 23.503 [20]. Optionally, a period of time or a traffic volume for the requested QoS can be included in the AF request. The Transaction Reference ID provided in the AF session with required QoS update request message is set to the Transaction Reference ID that was assigned, by the NEF, to the Nnef_AFsessionWithQoS_Create request message. The AF may, instead of a QoS Reference, provide one or more of the following individual QoS parameters: Requested 5GS Delay (optional), Requested Priority (optional), Requested Guaranteed Bitrate, Requested Maximum Bitrate, Maximum Burst Size and Requested Packet Error Rate. The AF may also provide an Averaging Window. Regardless whether the AF request is formulated using a QoS Reference or individual QoS parameters, the AF may also provide one or more of the following parameters that describe the traffic characteristics: flow direction, Burst Arrival Time at UE (uplink) or UPF (downlink), Periodicity, Time domain, Survival Time, Capability for BAT adaptation or BAT Window, Periodicity Range. The optional Alternative Service Requirements provided by the AF shall either contain QoS References or Requested Alternative QoS Parameter Set(s) in a prioritized order as specified in clause 6.1.3.22 of TS 23.503 [20]. Optionally, Packet Delay Variation requirements can be included in the AF request as described in clause 6.1.3.26 of TS 23.503 [20].\n2.\tThe NEF authorizes the AF request of updating AF session with required QoS and may apply policies to control the overall amount of QoS authorized for the AF. If the authorisation is not granted, all steps (except step 5) are skipped and the NEF replies to the AF with a Result value indicating that the authorisation failed.\n3.\tThe NEF shall contact the same NF type (i.e. TSCTSF or PCF) as with the initial Nnef_AFsessionWithQoS_Create request during the establishment procedure in clause 4.15.6.6. If the NEF determined not to invoke the TSCTSF, then steps 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 are executed, otherwise, steps 3a, 3b, 4a, 4b, 5, 6a, 6b, 7 are executed. If the Nnef_AfsessionWithQoS_Update adds any parameters that would require the NEF to invoke TSCTSF while the NEF determined not to invoke the TSCTSF for the initial Nnef_AFsessionWithQoS_Create request, the NEF shall reject the Nnef_AFsessionWithQoS_Update request with a cause value indicating the reason of failure.\nIf the NEF does not invoke the TSCTSF, the NEF interacts with the PCF by triggering a Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update request and forwards received parameters to the PCF. Any optionally received period of time or traffic volume is mapped and forwarded as sponsored data connectivity information (as defined in TS 23.503 [20]).\nIf the AF is considered to be trusted by the operator, the AF uses the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update request message to interact directly with PCF to update the reserving resources for an AF session.\n3a.\tIf the NEF decided to contact the TSCTSF when the session was established, the NEF forwards received parameters in the Ntsctsf_QoSandTSCAssistance_Update request message to the TSCTSF. Any optionally received period of time or traffic volume is mapped and forwarded as sponsored data connectivity information (as defined in TS 23.503 [20]).\nIf the AF is considered to be trusted by the operator, the AF uses the Ntsctsf_QoSandTSCAssistance_Update request message to interact directly with TSCTSF to update the reserving resources for an AF session.\n3b.\tThe TSCTSF interacts with the PCF by triggering a Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update request and forwards the received parameters after executing the adjustment and mapping actions described in step 3b of clause 4.15.6.6.\n4.\tThe PCF processes the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update request according to the actions described in step 4 of clause 4.15.6.6.\n4a.\tThe PCF processes the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update request according to the actions described in step 4a of clause 4.15.6.6. If the PCF has received a request to unsubscribe for 5GS Bridge/Router information Notification, the PCF uses the PCF initiated SM Policy Association Modification procedure as described in clause 4.16.5.2 to unsubscribe for 5GS Bridge/Router information event from the SMF.\n4b.\tThe TSCTSF sends a Ntsctsf_QoSandTSCAssistance_Update response message (Transaction Reference ID, Result) to the NEF. Result indicates whether the request is granted or not.\nIf the AF is considered to be trusted by the operator, the TSCTSF sends the Ntsctsf_QoSandTSCAssistance_Update response message directly to AF.\n5.\tThe NEF sends a Nnef_AFsessionWithQoS_Update response message (Transaction Reference ID, Result) to the AF.

The PCF may be in the Home PLMN, as it is the PCF that determines the URSP for the UE, or in the VPLMN and then the Application guidance for URSP determination is provided to the PCF in the HPLMN via the PCF of the VPLMN. The PCF in the VPLMN translates the Service Parameters values provided by the AF for inbound roamer to values applicable to the HPLMN, e.g. S-NSSAI as described in TS 23.503 [20].\nNOTE 1:\tThe operator can negotiate with external party (typically a Corporate represented by an AF) dedicated DNN(s) and/or S-NSSAI(s) for the traffic of UE(s) of this external party. UE(s) of the external party can be identified by a group identifier.\nThe guidance for URSP determination may be used to provide 5GC with guidance for the URSPs depending on the UE location. This is further described in TS 23.548 [74].\nFor providing guidance for URSP determination, the procedure defined in clause 4.15.6.7 is performed with the following considerations:\n1)\tService Description indicates an AF Identifier.\n2)\tService Parameters.\nInformation on the AF guidance for URSP determination which consists of a list of URSP rules that associate an application traffic descriptor with requested features for the candidate PDU sessions the application traffic may use:\n-\tAn application traffic descriptor, whose definition corresponds to that of the URSP Traffic Descriptors (as defined for the URSP rule in TS 23.503 [20] Table 6.6.2.1-2). When AF provides application guidance for URSP determination for PIN, the application traffic descriptor shall include PIN ID.\n-\tone or more sets of Route selection parameters, each parameter may correspond to:\n-\t(DNN, S-NSSAI). This may be provided by the AF or determined by the NEF based on the AF Identifier when it is not provided by the AF and the AF provides only one instance of AF guidance for URSP determination.

This may correspond to a geographical area (e.g. a civic address or shapes).\nNOTE 2:\tThe different sets of Route selection parameters indicate different sets of PDU Session information (DNN, S-NSSAI) that can be associated with applications matching the application traffic descriptor. Each set is meant to apply for a specific (set of) spatial validity condition. Each set is associated with a Route selection precedence to cope with the case where multiple spatial validity conditions overlap.\n-\tVPLMN ID(s) that indicates the PLMN(s) where the AF guidance on URSP determination and all its RSD(s), applies.\nIf the AF provides a geographical area as spatial validity condition, it is up to the NEF to transform this information into 3GPP identifiers (e.g. TAI(s)).\nAn AF sets the Requested PDU session type if the AF requests to change the PDU session type of the URSP rules.\nNEF may, based on local configuration, complement missing service parameters. Additionally, based on operator's local policy, NEF may request UDM for service specific authorization for the service parameters for an individual UE (e.g. to authorize the Corporate or MTC provider represented by the AF and the requested DNN, S-NSSAI for the related UE) before storing the service parameters into the UDR. If the request is targeting a group of UEs, NEF may also request UDM for service specific authorization for the group related data (see table 4.15.6.3b-1), i.e. the DNN, S-NSSAI associated to the group. If the request is targeting any UE (all UEs), NEF authorizes the request based on local policy (e.g. based on AF Id) without requesting for any service specific authorization from UDM. NEF requests UDM for service specific authorization for the service parameters provisioned via the Nudm_ServiceSpecificAuthorisation_Create service operation as defined in clause 4.15.6.7a.\nIf a group of UEs or any UE is requested, each individual UE authorization is performed at a later stage by PCF.\nNOTE 3:\tThe operator needs to ensure the consistency between the group related data and the UE group members subscription data, i.e. if a group is authorized for a given DNN/S-NSSAI as defined in the group related data, it needs to be ensured that all UE members of the group are provisioned with such DNN/S-NSSAI, since no individual UE check is required to be done by NEF against UDM.\nNOTE 4:\tAF guidance for application traffic is not related with 5G VN group.\n3)\tThe Target UE identifier(s) that may be a specific UE, identified by a GPSI, or a group of UE(s), identified by an External-Group-ID, or any UE of the PLMN of the NEF, or the PLMN ID(s) of inbound roamers that the AF request may be associated with.\nThe information on the AF guidance for URSP determination provided by the AF may be associated to:\na)\tUEs of the PLMN (of the NEF) when roaming in other PLMNs. In this case, the AF guidance for URSP determination targets to a specific UE, a group of UEs or any UE of the PLMN. In this case, the AF guidance for URSP determination associated to a specific UE, a group of UEs or any UE of the PLMN shall be also associated with the corresponding VPLMN(s) where the AF guidance for URSP determination shall be applied if the UE roams to that VPLMN(s). The list of VPLMN ID(s) is included in the Service Parameters.\nb)\tAn inbound roamer from one or more PLMN(s). In this case, the AF targets the AF guidance for URSP determination only with the inbound roamers of corresponding PLMN(s). The PLMN ID is included in the Service Parameters.\nNOTE 5:\tWildcarding of \"PLMN ID of inbound roamers\" will be handled by stage 3.\n4)\tSubscription to events.\nThe AF may subscribe to notifications about the outcome of the UE Policies delivery due to application guidance for URSP determination.\nThe usage of the AF guidance for application traffic is described in clause 6.6 of TS 23.548 [74].",

For every UE in the set, this list contains the IP address and the port number that are used by the UE for the communication with the AF.\nThe NEF receives the request for a Multi-member AF session with required QoS for a set of UEs identified by their addresses. The NEF then maps the request for Multi-member AF session with required QoS to individual requests for AF session with required QoS (i.e., one request for individual AF session with required QoS per UE address) and interacts with each of the UE's serving PCFs on a per AF session basis. The interaction follows the AF session with required QoS procedure as described in clauses 4.15.6.6 and 4.15.6.6a, except that the involvement of the TSCTSF and the provisioning of TSCTSF related information are not supported.\nThe NEF receives the outcome of the individual requests for AF session with required QoS corresponding to each UE's IP address and consolidates them into a single response before forwarding it to the AF based on a locally configured timer (which could be set to zero).\nNOTE 1:\tThe consolidation of the outcome of the individual requests and the locally configured timer allow the optimization of the NEF to AF signalling according to the specific Multi-member AF session with required QoS. Multiple responses could be sent by an NEF (as RAN nodes may responds late or signalling messages may get lost) and the details of the NEF behaviour (e.g. handling of UE addresses for which no response has been received within the locally configured timer) are to be defined by stage 3.\nThe AF can subscribe to QoS Monitoring (as described in clause 5.45 of TS 23.501 [2]) for the Multi-member AF session with required QoS. If so, QoS monitoring will be activated by the NEF for the whole set of UEs by interacting with each of the UE's serving PCFs on a per AF session basis. The NEF shall always set the NEF ID as the Target of Reporting and include the indication of direct event notification in the request to PCFs regardless of whether AF included the indication of direct event notification or not to ensure that QoS Monitoring reports shall be sent by the UPF directly to the NEF. The NEF forwards the QoS Monitoring reports to the AF together with the respective UE address individually or, optionally, in an aggregated manner based on a locally configured timer.\nWhen the AF subscribes to QoS Monitoring of UL and/or DL data rate (as described in clause 5.45 of TS 23.501 [2]) for the set of UEs, the AF may provide a Consolidated Data Rate threshold that is to be stored in the NEF. The Consolidated Data Rate threshold defines the upper bound of the aggregated data rate across all traffic flows corresponding to the list of UE addresses of the Multi-member AF session with required QoS. The AF may provide in addition a specific list of UE addresses subject to Consolidated Data Rate monitoring (which has to be the subset of the list of UE addresses for the Multi-member AF session), if only a part of the UEs participate in the current communication with the AF and the NEF maintains this list as well. The NEF aggregates the QoS Monitoring reports for data rate for those UEs identified by the specific list of UE addresses subject to Consolidated Data Rate monitoring (if available) or otherwise by the list of UE addresses for the Multi-member AF session with required QoS. The QoS Monitoring reports for data rate will then be sent to the AF by NEF, only if the aggregated data rate exceeds the Consolidated Data Rate threshold.\nThe following Table 4.15.6.13.1-1 describes the 4 types of requests for the Multi-member AF session with required QoS by the NEF and the corresponding requests to/from PCF using Npcf_PolicyAuthorization service. There may be different PCFs serving the PDU Sessions associated with the UE addresses in the Nnef_AFSessionWithQoS Request.\nTable 4.15.6.13.1-1: Mapping of requests for Multi-member AF session with required QoS service to the corresponding Npcf_PolicyAuthorization service operations\nNnef_AFSessionWithQoS Request\nNpcf_PolicyAuthorization request\nCreate\nNpcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create request for each UE address received in the Nnef_AFSessionWithQoS Request.\nNpcf_PolicyAuthorization_Subscribe to subscribe to QoS Monitoring reports for each UE address targeted for QoS monitoring received in the Nnef_AFSessionWithQoS Request.\nUpdate\nNpcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update request to update the QoS and/or QoS monitoring according to the Nnef_AFSessionWithQoS_Update Request.\nNpcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create request for each added UE address received in the Nnef_AFSessionWithQoS Request.\nNpcf_PolicyAuthorization_Delete request for each removed UE address received in the Nnef_AFSessionWithQoS Request.\nNpcf_PolicyAuthorization_Subscribe to subscribe to QoS Monitoring reports for each new UE address targeted for QoS monitoring received in the Nnef_AFSessionWithQoS Request.\nMore than one of the above operations can be requested at the same time.\nRevoke\nNpcf_PolicyAuthorization_Delete request for each UE address received in the Nnef_AFSessionWithQoS Request.\nNotify\nNpcf_PolicyAuthorization_Notify to report the events that NEF subscribed to.\nNOTE 2:\tIt is expected that the AF requests QoS and QoS monitoring for a specific traffic flow (used for the communication between a UE address and the AF) with either the procedure for Multi-member AF session with required QoS (described in this clause) or the procedure for AF session with required QoS as described in clause 4.15.6.6 and 4.15.6.6a.",

The optional Alternative Service Requirements provided by the AF shall either contain QoS References or Requested Alternative QoS Parameter Set(s) in a prioritized order as described in clause 6.1.3.22 of TS 23.503 [20]. The AF may provide QoS parameter(s) to be measured as defined in clause 5.45 of TS 23.501 [2], Reporting frequency, Target of reporting, optional an indication of direct event notification as described in clause 6.1.3.21 of TS 23.503 [20].\nThe AF may also provide the Consolidated Data Rate threshold and optionally, a list of UE addresses subject to Consolidated Data Rate monitoring. If so, the AF shall also subscribe to QoS Monitoring of UL and/or DL data rate described in clause 5.45 of TS 23.501 [2] .\nNOTE 1:\tWhen the Consolidated Data Rate threshold is provided, it, by default, applies to the list of UE addresses associated with the Multi-member AF session with required QoS. However, if the specific list of UE addresses subject to Consolidated Data Rate monitoring is also provided together with the Consolidate Data Rate threshold, then such list has to be the subset of the list of UE addresses.\n2.\tThe NEF authorizes the AF request that contains a list of UE addresses and may apply policies to control the overall amount of QoS authorized for the AF. If the authorisation is not granted, all steps (except step 8) are skipped and the NEF replies to the AF with a Result value indicating that the authorisation failed. The NEF assigns a Transaction Reference ID to the Nnef_AFsessionWithQoS_Create request. The NEF activates Consolidated Data Rate monitoring only when both the Consolidated Data Rate threshold and a request to do QoS Monitoring of data rate are provided by the AF.\n2a.\tIf the NEF recognizes, based on configuration, that the IP address(es) received in the list of UE addresses are different from the IP address(es) assigned by 5GC (i.e. the UE(s) are behind a NAT in UPFs), the NEF performs steps 3 to 6 of the AF specific UE ID retrieval procedure defined in clause 4.15.10 for each UE IP address with port number in order to identify the corresponding IP address (and IP domain, if necessary) that has been assigned by the 5GC. The NEF then uses the respective corresponding IP address (and IP domain, if necessary) in the following steps instead of the UE IP address provided by the AF.\n3-4.\tThe NEF finds BSF serving the UE IP address(es) using NRF and then for each UE IP address, the NEF uses Nbsf_Management_Discovery service operation, providing the UE IP address, to discover the responsible PCF for each of the PDU Sessions.\nSteps 5-7 apply for each UE address in the list of UE addresses.\n5.\tThe NEF provides the UE address and the received parameters in step 1 to the PCF in the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create request. NEF shall include the Target of reporting and indication of direct event notification to PCF as described in clause 4.15.6.13.1.\n6.\tStep 4 in Figure 4.15.6.6-1 applies. The PCF generates authorized QoS Monitoring policy according to the QoS Monitoring information if received from the NEF in step 5 and provides PCC rules with the policy to the SMF as described in clause 6.1.3.21 of TS 23.503 [20]. The SMF configures the UPF to perform QoS Monitoring as described in clause 5.8.2.18 of TS 23.501 [2].\n7.\tThe PCF sends the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create response message to the NEF.\n8.\tThe NEF aggregates the authorization responses from the PCFs and sends a Nnef_AFsessionWithQoS_Create response message (Transaction Reference ID, Result for list of UE addresses) with the aggregated authorization responses to the AF. Result for list of UE addresses includes whether the authorization was successful or has failed for every UE address in the list. The NEF stores the list of UE addresses for which the authorization was successful together with the Transaction Reference ID, the QoS and the QoS monitoring information.\nSteps 9-10 apply for each UE address in the list of UE addresses.\n9.\tStep 6 in Figure 4.15.6.6-1 applies.\n10.\tStep 7 in Figure 4.15.6.6-1 applies.\n11.\tThe NEF aggregates the notifications from the PCFs and sends a Nnef_AFsessionWithQoS_Notify message (Transaction Reference ID, Result for list of UE addresses) with the aggregated resource allocation status events to the AF. Result for list of UE addresses includes, for every UE address in the list, the information whether resources are allocated, resources are not allocated or resources are allocated while the currently fulfilled QoS matches an Alternative Service Requirement. The NEF updates the locally stored list of UE addresses by removing any UEs for which resources could not be allocated.\nNOTE 2:\tFor those UE address(es) that did not get any resources, the AF may request resource reservation again, by adding them to the list of UE address(es) as described in clause 4.15.6.13.3.\n12.\tAs direct event notification is requested based on the parameters received in step 5, the QoS Monitoring events are reported by the UPF(s) to the NEF using Nupf_EventExposure service as described in clause 5.2.26.2.\n13.\tWhen the NEF receives QoS Monitoring events, the NEF sends Nnef_AFsessionWithQoS_Notify message with the individual or aggregated QoS Monitoring events to the AF as described for the QoS Monitoring and the Consolidated Data Rate monitoring in clause 4.15.6.13.1.",

Then, the NEF continues by invoking one of the following Npcf_PolicyAuthorization procedures for every affected UE address:\na)\tIf the NEF determines that a new UE is to be added to the list, the NEF performs steps 2a to 7 of clause 4.15.6.13.2 for the corresponding UE. The NEF uses the latest information on QoS and QoS monitoring for the interaction with the PCF. The NEF adds the address of the new UE to the locally stored list of UE addresses if the authorization was successful.\nb)\tIf the NEF determines that an existing UE is to be removed from the list, the NEF initiates the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Delete as described in clause 5.2.5.3.4 excluding TSCTSF related info towards the PCF for the corresponding UE. The NEF removes the UE address from the locally stored list of UE addresses.\nc)\tIf the NEF determines that an update of the QoS or the QoS monitoring or both for existing UE addresses is necessary, the NEF initiates the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update to the respective UE's serving PCF(s) on a per AF session basis and step 4 in Figure 4.15.6.6a-1 applies. The NEF removes any UE addresses for which the authorization of the update request has failed from the list of UE addresses. The NEF stores any change to the QoS or the QoS monitoring information.\n6.\tWhen an interaction with PCF(s) has occurred during step 5, the NEF aggregates the authorization responses from the PCF(s) and sends the Nnef_AFSessionWithQoS Update response (Transaction Reference ID, Result for list of UE addresses) with the aggregated authorization results to the AF.

The calculation and the reporting of the NSR to the AF depends on operator configuration (e.g. SLAs, usage etc.).\nWhen an AF requests one-time Network Status from the NEF, the NEF can optionally provide a time interval at which the AF is allowed to re-issue the same request for network status.\nNOTE 2:\tThe time interval provided by NEF can be ignored by the AF if the subsequent request on network status is considerably different with regards to the geographical area or the UE.",

Cancelling is done by sending Nnef_TimeSynchronization_CapsUnsubscribe request identifying the subscription to cancel with Subscription Correlation ID.\nFigure 4.15.9.2-1: Procedure for exposing 5GS and/or UE availability and capabilities for Time Synchronization services\n1.\tUpon PDU Session establishment, the PCF determines if the PDU Session is potentially impacted by time synchronization service (based on local configuration or 5GS Bridge/Router information event from SMF as described in SM Policy Association Establishment procedure in clause 4.16.4). In this case the PCF invokes Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Notify service operation to the TSCTSF discovered and selected as described in clause 6.3.24 of TS 23.501 [2]. The Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Notify service operation includes the UE address of the PDU Session and DNN/S-NSSAI.\nNOTE:\tIn the case of private IPv4 address being used for the UE, the DNN and S-NSSAI are required for session binding in the PCF.\nThe PCF registers to BSF as described in TS 23.503 [20]. TSCTSF invokes a Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create request message to the PCF and stores the DNN, S-NSSAI and IP address as received from PCF and SUPI as received from BSF and associates them with the AF-session.\nIf PMIC/UMIC information from the DS-TT or NW-TT is available at the PCF, the PCF reports it to the TSCTSF invoking Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Notify.\n2.\tThe AF subscribes to the UE availability for time synchronization service and provides the associated Notification Target Address of the AF by sending Nnef_TimeSynchronization_CapsSubscribe request.\nReport Type defines the type of reporting requested (e.g. one-time reporting, periodic reporting or event based reporting).\nThe request may include DNN and slicing information (S-NSSAI) and shall include an AF-Service-Identifier. If the DNN and S-NSSAI are omitted in the request, the NEF uses the AF-Service-Identifier to determine the target DNN and slicing information (S-NSSAI).\nThe Event Filter may include a list of UE identities (GPSIs) or Groups of UEs identified by an External Group Identifier that further define the subset of the target UEs. If the request does not include UE identities nor External Group Identifier, the request is targeted to any UE with a PDU Session using the DNN and S-NSSAI. The NEF forwards the GPSIs or the External Group Identifier to the TSCTSF by including them/it inside the Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_CapsSubscribe request.\nAdditionally, the Event Filter may include one or more of the requested PTP instance type, requested transport protocol for PTP, or requested PTP Profile as described in Table 5.2.6.25.6-1.\nWhen the NEF processes the AF request the AF-Service-Identifier may be used to authorize the AF request.\nDepending on the AF-Service-Identifier and/or DNN/S-NSSAI, the NEF may reject the request if the list of UE identities or External Group Identifier is not included in the request.\nTo unsubscribe to the UE availability for time synchronization for a list of UE(s), the AF invokes Nnef_TimeSynchronization_CapsUnsubscribe service operation and provides the Subscription Correlation ID.\n3.\t(In the case of Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_CapsSubscribe): The NEF discovers the TSCTSF as described in clause 6.3.24 of TS 23.501 [2]. The NEF invokes the Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_CapsSubscribe request service operation to the selected TSCTSF.\n(In the case of Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_CapsUnsubscribe): The NEF uses the Subscription Correlation ID to determine the TSCTSF and interacts with the TSCTSF by triggering a Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_CapsUnsubscribe request message.\nThe AF that is part of operator's trust domain may invoke the services directly with TSCTSF.\n4.\tIf the Event Filter includes GPSI(s), an External Group Identifier or an Internal Group Identifier, the TSCTSF uses the Nudm_SDM_Get request to retrieve the subscription information (SUPI(s)) from the UDM using each GPSI or the External Group Identifier as received from the NEF or an Internal Group Identifier as provided directly by the AF (in the case when the AF is within the operator's domain).\nThe TSCTSF requests the Time Synchronization Subscription data from the UDM. The TSCTSF may also use stored Time Synchronization Subscription data which it retrieved from the UDM when the UE established PDU session, see clause 4.28.3.1.\n5.\tThe UDM provides the Nudm_SDM_Get response containing SUPI that are mapped from each received GPSI or a list of SUPIs mapped from the External/Internal Group Identifier and identify UEs targeted by the AF request.\n6.\t(in the case of Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_CapsSubscribe): The TSCTSF uses the parameters received in step 3 and step 5 (i.e. DNN, S-NSSAI and the list of SUPIs if present) to find matching AF-session(s).\nIf the Time Synchronization Subscription data is available, the subscription data returned by the UDM includes the AF request authorization that indicates whether the AF is allowed to request (g)PTP-based time distribution for DNN/S-NSSAI. If the subscription data indicates that the AF is not allowed to request (g)PTP-based time synchronization, the AF-session is excluded from the list of matching AF-sessions.\nFor any such matching AF-session, the TSCTSF interacts with the PCF by triggering a Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update request message.\n(in the case of Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_CapsUnsubscribe): The TSCTSF uses the Subscription Correlation ID to determine the AF sessions and interacts with the PCF(s) by triggering a Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Delete request message. Steps 10-15 are skipped.\n7.\tTSCTSF acknowledges the execution of Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_CapsSubscribe to the requester that initiated the request. The acknowledgement contains a Subscription Correlation ID that the requester can use to cancel or modify the subscription.\n8.\tNEF acknowledges the execution of Nnef_TimeSynchronization_CapsSubscribe to the requester that initiated the request. The acknowledgement contains a Subscription Correlation ID that the AF can use to cancel or modify the subscription.\n9.\tAs part of Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update request, the TSCTSF uses the procedures as described in clause K.2.1 of TS 23.501 [2] to determine the (g)PTP capabilities from the DS-TT. If the TSCTSF has not determined the (g)PTP capabilities from the NW-TT, the TSCTSF determines the capabilities using the procedures as described in clause K.2.1 of TS 23.501 [2].\nThe TSCTSF composes the time synchronization capabilities for the DS-TT/UE(s) connected to the NW-TT based on the capability information received from the DS-TT(s) and NW-TT. If the Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_CapsSubscribe request include an Event Filter with one or more of the requested PTP instance type, requested transport protocol for PTP, or requested PTP Profile, the TSCTSF considers only the DS-TT(s) and NW-TT(s) with these capabilities as part of the time synchronization capability set that is reported to the NEF (or AF).\nThe TSCTSF maintains association between the user-plane Node ID, the time synchronization capabilities, the reference to the capabilities (as identified by the Subscription Correlation ID), the Event Filter (if available), the NEF or AF Notification Target Address and list of the AF sessions with PCFs with this user-plane Node ID. If the Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_CapsSubscribe request includes one or more Event Filter(s), the TSCTSF considers only the matching UE identities and the DS-TT(s) and NW-TT(s) with the matching capabilities to be included in the associated AF sessions.\n10.\tThe TSCTSF sends Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_CapsNotify (as described in clause 5.2.27.2.8) to the NEF. The message includes the time synchronization capabilities as composed in step 9. The message contains one or more user-plane Node ID(s) and a list of UE identities associated to each user-plane Node ID and time synchronization capabilities for each set of DS-TTs connected to given user-plane Node ID, as described in Table 5.2.6.25.8-1. The user-plane Node ID identifies the NW-TT to where the UE/DS-TT(s) are connected to.\n11.\tThe NEF sends Nnef_TimeSynchronization_CapsNotify with Time Synchronization capability event (as described in Table 5.2.6.25.8-1) to the AF.\n12-13.\tUpon PDU Session Establishment as defined clause 4.3.2.2.1, steps 1, 9, 10 and 11 are repeated for the new PDU Session.\n14.\tIf necessary, e.g. upon PDU Session establishment or release, the TSCTSF may update the time synchronization capabilities for the DS-TT/UE(s) connected to the NW-TT(s). The TSCTSF sends Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_CapsNotify with Time Synchronization capability event (as described in Table 5.2.6.25.8-1) containing the updated capabilities to the NEF.\n15.\tThe NEF sends Nnef_TimeSynchronization_CapsNotify containing the updated capabilities to the AF.",

The TSCTSF uses the parameters (e.g. requested PTP instance type, transport protocol and PTP profile) in the Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_ConfigCreate request to determine suitable DS-TT(s) and corresponding AF-sessions among all AF-sessions that are associated with the Subscription Correlation ID and user-plane node ID in the request.\nThe TSCTSF maintains association between list of suitable AF-sessions, corresponding time synchronization configuration, the PTP instance reference in 5GS, PTP instance references in each involved DS-TT and NW-TT and Subscription Correlation ID and user-plane node ID as given in step 1.\nNOTE 2:\tThe AF-sessions that are not associated with a time synchronization configuration, are available to be selected as suitable AF-sessions in another Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_ConfigCreate request.\nThe TSCTSF uses the procedures described in clause K.2.2 of TS 23.501 [2] to configure and initialize the PTP instance in the DS-TT(s) and NW-TT. The TSCTSF constructs a PMIC to each DS-TT/UE to activate the time synchronization service in DS-TT in respect to the service parameters in the request in step 2. The TSCTSF constructs PMIC(s) and UMIC to NW-TT to activate the time synchronization service in NW-TT in respect to the service parameters in the request in step 2.\nUpon reception of responses from each DS-TT and NW-TT, the TSCTSF determines the state of the time synchronization configuration.\nThe TSCTSF constructs a PMIC to each DS-TT/UE to subscribe for the port management information changes in the DS-TT. The TSCTSF constructs PMIC(s) and UMIC to NW-TT to subscribe for the port management and user-plane management information changes in NW-TT. The TSCTSF retrieves the PMIC(s) and UMIC via means of Npcf_PolicyAuthorization service operations.\nThe create request creates also a subscription for notifications for the changes in the time synchronization service configuration.

If the start-time is in the past, the TSCTSF treats the request as if the time synchronization service was activated immediately. When the start-time is reached, the TSCTSF proceeds as described in this step above. When the stop-time is reached for active time synchronization service configuration, the TSCTSF proceeds as Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_ConfigDelete was received as described in clause 4.15.9.3.4.\nIf the Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_ConfigCreate request contains a spatial validity condition, then the TSCTSF performs the following operations:\n-\tTSCTSF determines whether the TSCTSF has subscribed for the UE presence in Area of Interest composed by the TA(s) in the Time Synchronization Coverage Area. If not, the TSCTSF may either discover the AMF(s) serving the TA(s) comprising the Time Synchronization Coverage Area or discover the serving AMF(s) for each UE identified by a GPSI/SUPI as described in clause 5.27.1.10 of TS 23.501 [2].\nThen the TSCTSF subscribes to the AMF(s) to receive notifications about the UE presence in Area of Interest using Namf_EventExposure operation with the corresponding event filters as described in clause 5.2.2.3 and in clause 5.3.4.4. of TS 23.501 [2].

NG-RAN timing synchronization status updates provisioning may be configured via AMF (with node level signalling as illustrated in steps 1-4).\n2.\tThe TSCTSF invokes an Namf_Communication_NonUeN2MessageTransfer request to the AMF. Inside this request, the TSCTSF includes an N2 Container indicating to the NG-RAN to start reporting TSS attributes and containing the TSCTSF Instance ID. Additionally, in this request the TSCTSF may specify TA(s) and/or NG-RAN node(s). Based on local configuration and/or TA or NG-RAN node information as received from the TSCTSF, the AMF may request some or all NG-RAN nodes in the TA(s) to perform the timing synchronizations status reporting.\n3-4.\tThe AMF sends the corresponding N2 messages to all applicable NG-RAN nodes. Upon receiving a response(s) from the NG-RAN node(s), the AMF includes in the Namf_Communication_NonUeN2MessageTransfer response or Namf_Communication_N2InfoNotify request to the TSCTSF a list of N2 Containers containing response messages from the NG-RAN nodes and the corresponding NG-RAN node identifier(s). The AMF may aggregate the response messages it receives from the NG-RAN nodes.\n5.\t(When the procedure is triggered by the AF request for PTP instance activation, modification and if the UPF/NW-TT is involved in providing time information to DS-TT):\nUpon the reception of the clock quality acceptance criteria in the AF request in step 0, the TSCTSF needs to be subscribed to UPF/NW-TT timing synchronization status updates at the UPF/NW-TT that may provision time information via PTP to the target UE. UPF/NW-TT timing synchronization status updates provisioning may be configured via OAM or via UMIC.\n6.\tThe RAN node and TSCTSF are pre-configured for the thresholds for each timing synchronization status attribute as described in clause 5.27.1.12 of TS 23.501 [2].\n7-8.\tIf the NG-RAN node detects a change on its timing synchronization status as described in clause 5.27.1.12 of TS 23.501 [2] and the timing synchronization status reporting is configured via the AMF in steps 1-3, the NG-RAN node notifies the AMF providing a NG-RAN timing synchronization status update. The update can contain the information elements listed in Table 5.27.1.12-1 of TS 23.501 [2], TSCTSF Instance ID and the scope of the timing synchronization status (as described in clause 5.27.1.12 of TS 23.501 [2]). The AMF forwards the latest received NG-RAN timing synchronization status update in the Namf_Communication_NonUeN2InfoNotify to the specific TSCTSF instance identified by the TSCTSF Instance ID as specified in step 2.\n9.\tIf the UPF/NW-TT detects a change on its timing synchronization status and timing synchronization status reporting is configured via UMIC in step 3, the UPF/NW-TT notifies the TSCTSF providing a UPF/NW-TT timing synchronization status update via UMIC. The update can contain the information elements listed in Table K.1-2 of TS 23.501 [2].\n10.\tUpon the reception of a change in the NG-RAN and/or NW-TT timing synchronization status update, the TSCTSF shall determine if the UE is impacted and whether the clock quality acceptance criteria can still be met. For each scope of the timing synchronization status received from the RAN in step 6, if the status indicates degradation, TSCTSF may set the Area of Interest to gNB node ID(s) or Cell IDs in the scope of the timing synchronization status. The TSCTSF uses the resulted Area of Interest to subscribe for the UE presence in Area of Interest from the AMF that is serving the gNB node ID as described in clause 5.27.1.12 of TS 23.501 [2]. If the status indicates improvement, the TSCTSF may remove the corresponding scope from the subscription.\nUpon reception of notification for the UE presence in the Area of Interest, if the TSCTSF determines that the UE is impacted for ASTI service, the TSCTSF performs steps 15-16 in clause 4.15.9.4 to notify the AF the acceptance criteria result.\nUpon reception of notification for the UE presence in the Area of Interest, if the TSCTSF determines that the UE is impacted for PTP service, the TSCTSF performs steps 9-11 in clause 4.15.9.3.2 to notify the AF the acceptance criteria result.\n11-14.\tIf the TSCTSF determines to unsubscribe from the NG-RAN timing synchronization status updates, the following steps need to be taken:\n11.\tThe TSCTSF instance invokes the Namf_Communication_NonUeN2MessageTransfer request that includes its TSCTSF Instance ID and an N2 Container indicating to the NG-RAN(s) to stop reporting the TSS attributes.\n12.\tThe AMF sends the corresponding N2 message to the applicable NG-RAN nodes.\n13.\tNG-RAN responds to the AMF, and the AMF provides a response to the Namf_Communication_NonUeN2MessageTransfer request from the TSCTSF instance.\nNG-RAN stops reporting the TSS attributes to the AMF for the TSCTSF instances that sent the Namf_Communication_NonUeN2MessageTransfer with an N2 Container indicating to stop reporting NG-RAN timing synchronization status.\nNG-RAN stops reporting the TSS attributes to the AMF once all the TSCTSF have requested to stop reporting.\n14.\tAfter receiving an Namf_Communication_NonUeN2MessageTransfer response or Namf_Communication_N2InfoNotify request, the TSCTSF invokes the Namf_Communication_NonUeN2InfoUnSubscribe service operation to the AMF to unsubscribe from the NG-RAN timing synchronization status updates.",

The request message shall include UE address (IP address or MAC address) and AF Identifier, it may include, Port Number associated with the IP address, MTC Provider Information, Application Port ID, IP domain. The MTC Provider Information identifies the MTC Service Provider and/or MTC Application. If available, the AF may also provide the corresponding DNN and/or S-NSSAI.\nNOTE 3:\tThe MTC Provider Information can be used by any type of Service Providers (MTC or non-MTC) or Corporate or External Parties for, e.g. to distinguish their different customers.\nNOTE 4:\tThe combination of IP address and Port Number can be used by 5GC to derive the UE private IP address assigned by 5GC if the UE is behind a NAT, see steps 3-6 below.\nNOTE 5:\tThe Application Port ID is as defined in Nnef_Trigger_Delivery.\nNOTE 6:\tThe NEF can validate the provided MTC Provider Information and override it to a NEF selected MTC Provider Information based on configuration. How the NEF determines the MTC Provider Information, if not present, is left to implementation (e.g. based on the requesting AF).\n2.\tThe NEF authorizes the AF request. If the authorisation is not granted, the NEF replies to the AF with a Result value indicating authorisation failure; otherwise the NEF proceeds with the following steps. The NEF determines corresponding DNN and/or S-NSSAI information: this may have been provided by the AF or is determined by the NEF based on the requesting AF Identifier, MTC Provider Information.\nIf the NEF has received a Port Number in step 1, based on configuration, the NEF may recognize the address received is an IP address which is different from the actual private UE IP address assigned by 5GC, i.e. the UE is behind a NAT in UPF. If so, the NEF performs steps 3 to 6. Otherwise, steps 3 to 6 are skipped.\n3.\tThe NEF uses the Nnrf_NFDiscovery service operation to obtain the address of the UPF implementing NAT functionality for the UE (public) IP address. The request includes the UE (public) IP address. The NEF may also include the DNN and S-NSSAI associated with the AF ID, as well as the IP domain.\n4.\tThe NRF responds with a Nnrf_NFDiscovery response message including the UPF address of the UPF implementing NAT functionality for the UE (public) IP address.\n5.\tThe NEF uses the Nupf_GetUEPrivateIPaddrAndIdentifiers_Get service operation to request UE's (private) IP address from the UPF. The request includes the UE (public) IP address and Port Number and optionally IP domain, DNN and S-NSSAI associated with the AF ID.\n6.\tThe UPF responds with the Nupf_GetUEPrivateIPaddrAndIdentifiers_Get response message including UE's IP address and optionally, the IP domain. If the UPF has applied a NAT functionality, the UE's IP address returned by the UPF is the private UE IP address. If IP domain of UE private IP address is returned from UPF, it always takes precedence regardless of whether the IP domain information also provided by AF when it invokes Nnef_UEId_Get service operation. If UPF has the SUPI or GPSI of the UE, the UPF may return SUPI or GPSI and in this case steps 7-8 are skipped.\nFor HR-SBO case as described in clause 4.3.6.1 and in TS 23.548 [74], an indication that the UE PDU session is working in HR-SBO mode, SUPI and HPLMN DNN and S-NSSAI of the PDU session are also provided by UPF.\nNOTE 7:\tThe SUPI/GPSI is only available when the SMF provides it to the UPF for the purposes defined in TS 29.244 [69].\n7-8.\tThe NEF uses the Nbsf_Management_Discovery service operation with UE address and IP domain and /or DNN and/or S-NSSAI to retrieve the session binding information of the UE. If no SUPI is received in the session binding information from the BSF, the NEF replies to the AF with a Result value indicating that the UE ID is not available.\n9.\tThe NEF interacts with UDM to retrieve the AF specific UE Identifier via the Nudm_SDM_Get service operation. The request message includes SUPI or GPSI and at least one of Application Port ID, MTC Provider Information or AF Identifier.\n10.\tThe UDM responds to the NEF with an AF specific UE Identifier represented as an External Identifier for the UE which is uniquely associated with the Application Port ID, MTC provider Information and/or AF Identifier.\n11.\tThe NEF further responds to the AF with the information (including the AF specific UE Identifier represented as an External Identifier) received from the UDM.\n4.15.10A\tMSISDN retrieval\nThis clause contains the detailed description and procedures for UE ID retrieval in the GPSI format of MSISDN as defined in TS 23.003 [33] by AFs.

For the roaming scenarios, the V-PCF interacts with the AMF.\n1.\tBased on local policies, the AMF decides to establish AM Policy Association with the (V-)PCF then steps 2 to 3 are performed under the conditions described below.\n2.\t[Conditional] If the AMF has not yet obtained access and mobility related policy information for the UE or if the access and mobility related policy information in the AMF is no longer valid, the AMF requests the PCF to apply operator policies for the UE from the PCF. The AMF sends Npcf_AMPolicyControl_Create to the (V-)PCF to establish an AM Policy Association with the (V-)PCF. The request includes the following information: SUPI, Internal Group (see clause 5.9.7 of TS 23.501 [2]), subscription notification indication and if available, Service Area Restrictions, RFSP index, Subscribed UE-AMBR, List of Subscribed UE-Slice-MBR, the Allowed NSSAI, Partially Allowed NSSAI, S-NSSAI(s) rejected partially in the RA, Rejected S-NSSAI(s) for the RA, Pending NSSAI, Target NSSAI (see clause 5.3.4.3.3 of TS 23.501 [2]), Network Slice Replacement supported for the UE (see clause 5.15.19 of TS 23.501 [2]), GPSI, which are retrieved from the UDM during the update location procedure and may include Access Type and RAT Type, PEI, ULI, UE time zone and Serving Network (PLMN ID, or PLMN ID and NID, see clause 5.34 of TS 23.501 [2]).\nWhen AMF utilizes an NWDAF, it may add the NWDAF serving the UE identified by the NWDAF instance ID.

If policy counter status reporting is already established for the subscriber and the PCF determines that the status of additional policy counters is required, the PCF initiates an Intermediate Spending Limit Report Retrieval as defined in clause 4.16.8.3.\nNOTE 1:\tThe Nudr_DM_Query may include the Spending Limit Information, i.e., the policy counters and their latest status. Thus the PCF can provide the AM policy to the AMF before contacting the CHF. The PCF may need to update the AMF depending on the statuses of the policy counters provided by the CHF.\nNOTE 2:\tPotential inconsistencies between the policy counter and its status in the UDR and in the CHF can happen given that the CHF may update the policy counter and its status at any time, as such it is recommended that the PCF contacts the CHF if the policy counters and its status stored in the UDR is used, to be able to receive updated information from the CHF.\nIn non-roaming case, the PCF may request notifications from the UDR on changes in the subscription information by invoking Nudr_DM_Subscribe service operation, Data Set \"Policy Data\" and Data Subset \"Access and Mobility policy control data\" as defined in clause 6.2.1.3 of TS 23.503 [20] and/or Data set \"application data\" and Data Subset \"AM influence information\" as defined in clause 6.2.1.6 of TS 23.503 [20].\nThe (V)-PCF responds to the Npcf_AMPolicyControl_Create service operation. The (V)-PCF provides access and mobility related policy information (e.g. Service Area Restrictions) as defined in clause 6.5 of TS 23.503 [20]. In addition, (V)-PCF can provide Policy Control Request Trigger of AM Policy Association to AMF.

In the home routed roaming case, the V-PCF is not involved and the H-PCF interacts with the H-SMF.\nThis procedure is used in UE requests a PDU Session Establishment as explained in clause 4.3.2.2.1, for non-roaming and local breakout roaming. For home-routed roaming, as explained in clause 4.3.2.2.2.\nFor local breakout roaming, the interaction with HPLMN (e.g. step 3) is not used. In local breakout roaming, the V-PCF interacts with the UDR of the VPLMN.\n1.\tThe SMF determines that the PCC authorization is required and requests to establish an SM Policy Association with the PCF by invoking Npcf_SMPolicyControl_Create operation, including information about the PDU Session as specified in clause 5.2.5.4.2.\nThe SMF provides Trace Requirements to the PCF when it has received Trace Requirements and\tit has selected a different PCF than the one received from the AMF.\nIf the DNN Selection Mode indicates that the DNN is not explicitly subscribed, the PCF may use the local configuration instead of PDU Session policy control data in UDR.\nThe QoS constraints from the VPLMN are provided by the H-SMF to the H-PCF in the home routed roaming scenario as defined in clause 4.3.2.2.2.\nIf the SMF utilizes an NWDAF or in case the SMF has received information from AMF or UPF that are consumer of analytic services, the SMF includes the IDs of each of these NWDAFs serving the UE (for SMF, AMF and UPF), identified by the NWDAF instance Id. The Analytics ID(s) are also included per NWDAF service instance.\nThe SMF provides the PCF binding information (of the PCF for the UE) to the PCF if the Request for notification of SM Policy Association establishment and termination to a DNN, S-NSSAI together with PCF binding information is received from the AMF.\n2.\tIf the PCF does not have the subscriber's subscription related information, it sends a request to the UDR by invoking Nudr_DM_Query (SUPI, DNN, S-NSSAI, Policy Data, PDU Session policy control data, Remaining allowed Usage data) service in order to receive the information related to the PDU Session. The PCF may request notifications from the UDR on changes in the subscription information by invoking Nudr_DM_Subscribe (Policy Data, SUPI, DNN, S-NSSAI, Notification Target Address (+ Notification Correlation Id), Event Reporting Information (continuous reporting), PDU Session policy control data, Remaining allowed Usage data) service. If the PCF does not have the 5G VN group data for the group identified by Internal Group Identifier as indicated by SMF in Npcf_SMPolicyControl_Create, the PCF retrieves the 5G VN group data from UDR and subscribes to changes on the 5G VN group data, see similar way to how the PCF does it during UE Policy Association establishment as described in clause 4.16.11. If the PCF receives the Maximum Group Data Rate in 5G VN group data, the PCF performs the group related policy control as described in clauses 6.1.5 and 6.2.1.11 of TS 23.503 [20].\nNOTE 1:\tFor local breakout roaming, PDU Session policy control subscription information and Remaining allowed usage subscription information for monitoring control as defined in clause 6.2.1.3 of TS 23.503 [20] are not available in V-UDR and V-PCF uses locally configured information according to the roaming agreement with the HPLMN operator.\n3.\tIf the PCF determines that the policy decision depends on the status of the policy counters available at the CHF and such reporting is not established for the subscriber, the PCF initiates an Initial Spending Limit Report Retrieval as defined in clause 4.16.8.2. If policy counter status reporting is already established for the subscriber and the PCF determines that the status of additional policy counters is required, the PCF initiates an Intermediate Spending Limit Report Retrieval as defined in clause 4.16.8.3.\nNOTE 2:\tThe Nudr_DM_Query in step 2 may include the Spending Limit Information, i.e., the policy counters and their latest status. Thus the PCF can provide the SM policy to the SMF before contacting the CHF. The PCF may need to update the SMF depending on the statuses of the policy counters provided by the CHF.\nNOTE 3:\tPotential inconsistencies between the policy counter and its status in the UDR and in the CHF can happen given that the CHF may update the policy counter and its status at any time, as such it is recommended that the PCF contacts the CHF if the policy counters and its status stored in the UDR is used, to be able to receive updated information from the CHF.\n4.\tThe PCF makes the authorization and the policy decision. The PCF may reject Npcf_SMPolicyControl_Create request when Validation condition is not satisfied. (see clause 6.1.2.4 of TS 23.503 [20]).\nThe PCF may invoke Nbsf_Management_Register service operation to create the binding information in BSF.\nThe PCF may report that a SM Policy Association is established as described in clause 4.16.14.2.\nIn the non-roaming case, the PCF may subscribe to Analytics from NWDAF as defined in clause 6.1.1.3 of TS 23.503 [20].\nIn the home-routed roaming scenario, the H-PCF ensures that the QoS constraints provided by the VPLMN are taken into account as described in TS 23.503 [20].\n5.\tThe PCF answers with a Npcf_SMPolicyControl_Create response; in its response the PCF may provide policy information defined in clause 5.2.5.4 (and in TS 23.503 [20]). The SMF enforces the decision. The SMF implicitly subscribes to changes in the policy decisions.\nNOTE 4:\tAfter this step the PCF can subscribe to SMF events associated with the PDU Session.\nIf the PCF determines based on a local policy, that the PDU Session is potentially impacted by (g)PTP time synchronization service, or the PDU Session belongs to a 5GS DetNet router, the PCF can include a subscription for SMF event for \"5GS Bridge/Router information\" associated with the PDU Session into the Npcf_SMPolicyControl_Create response. In this case, if the SMF has stored the 5GS Bridge/Router information and has not reported the event to the PCF, the SMF initiates an SM Policy Association Modification procedure and notifies the PCF for the event of \"5GS Bridge/Router information Notification\".",

      "content": "The UE Policy Association Establishment procedure, which may be performed for a UE registered in the same AMF or different AMFs for 3GPP access and non-3GPP access, concerns the following scenarios:\n1.\tUE initial registration with the network.\n2.\tThe AMF relocation with PCF change in handover procedure and registration procedure.\n3.\tUE registration with 5GS when the UE moves from EPS to 5GS and there is no existing UE Policy Association between AMF and PCF for this UE.\nIn Non-roaming case, the H-PCF may interact with the CHF in HPLMN to make a decision about UE Policies based on spending limits.\nFigure 4.16.11-1: UE Policy Association Establishment\nThis procedure concerns both roaming and non-roaming scenarios.\nIn the non-roaming case the V-PCF is not involved and the role of the H-PCF is performed by the PCF. For the roaming scenarios, the V-PCF interacts with the AMF and the H-PCF interacts with the V-PCF:\n1.\tThe AMF establishes UE Policy Association with the (V-)PCF when a UE Policy Container is received from the UE. If a UE Policy Container is not received from the UE, the AMF may establish UE Policy Association with the (V-)PCF based on AMF local configuration.\nNOTE 1:\tIn roaming scenario, the AMF local configuration can indicate whether UE Policy delivery is needed based on the roaming agreement with home PLMN of the UE.\n2.\tThe AMF sends a Npcf_UEPolicyControl Create Request with the following information: SUPI, may include Access Type and RAT, PEI, ULI, UE time zone, Serving Network (PLMN ID, or PLMN ID and NID, see clause 5.34 of TS 23.501 [2]), the Internal-Group-ID-list and UE Policy Container (the list of stored PSIs, operating system identifier, Indication of UE support for ANDSP, indication of UE capability of reporting URSP rule enforcement to network, indication of support of URSP delivery in EPS). In roaming scenario, based on operator policies, the AMF may provide to the V-PCF the PCF ID of the selected H-PCF. The V-PCF contacts the H-PCF. In roaming case, steps 3 and 4 are executed, otherwise step 5 follows.\nIf the AMF, based on configuration, is aware that the UE is accessing over a gNB using satellite backhaul, the AMF includes the Satellite backhaul category as described in clause 5.43 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf during UE initial registration the AMF receives from the UE the indication of support of N3IWF selection based on the slices the UE wishes to use over untrusted non-3GPP access and/or of UE support for TNGF selection based on the slices the UE wishes to use over trusted non-3GPP access, the AMF shall indicate to the PCF that the UE supports N3IWF selection based on the slices the UE wishes to use over untrusted non-3GPP access and/or UE support for TNGF selection based on the slices the UE wishes to use over trusted non-3GPP access. The AMF may request to the PCF to receive a notification when the provisioning in the UE of ANDSP/WLANSP with slice information has finished.\n3.\tThe V-PCF forwards the information received from AMF in step 2 to the H-PCF. When a UE Policy Container is received at initial registration, the H-PCF may store the PEI, the OSId, indication of UE capability of reporting URSP rule enforcement to network, indication of support of URSP delivery in EPS or the indication of UE support for ANDSP in the UDR using Nudr_DM_Create including DataSet \"Policy Data\" and Data Subset \"UE context policy control data\".\nThe H-PCF may invoke the Nudr_DM_Query service to the UDR. And the UDR may response with the requested policy control subscription data as in clause 6.2.1.3 of TS 23.503 [20] and/or application data as in clause 6.2.1.6 of TS 23.503 [20].\nThe V-PCF may retrieve the Application guidance on URSP Rule for inbound roamers of the PLMN of the SUPI, if not available, using Nudr_DM_Query or Nudr_DM_Subscribe including the Data Set \"Application Data\" and Data Subset \"Service Specific Information\" and DataKey set to \"PLMN ID(s) of inbound roamers\".\n4.\tThe H-PCF sends a Npcf_UEPolicyControl Create Response to the V-PCF. The H-PCF may provide the Policy Control Request Trigger parameters in the Npcf_UEPolicyControl Create Response. Before sending the response, the H-PCF may determine that the decision about UE policy control depends on the status of the policy counters available at the CHF and if such reporting is not established for the subscriber, the H-PCF initiates an Initial Spending Limit Report Retrieval as defined in clause 4.16.8.2. If policy counter status reporting is already established for the subscriber and the H-PCF determines that the statuses of additional policy counters are required, the H-PCF initiates an Intermediate Spending Limit Report Retrieval as defined in clause 4.16.8.3.\nNOTE 2:\tThe Nudr_DM_Query in step 3 may include the Spending Limit Information, i.e., the policy counters and their latest status. Thus the PCF can provide the UE policy to the AMF before contacting the CHF. The PCF may need to update the AMF depending on the statuses of the policy counters provided by the CHF.\nNOTE 3:\tPotential inconsistencies between the policy counter and its status in the UDR and in the CHF can happen given that the CHF may update the policy counter and its status at any time, as such it is recommended that the PCF contacts the CHF if the policy counters and its status stored in the UDR is used, to be able to receive updated information from the CHF.\nThe (H-)PCF in roaming and the PCF in non-roaming may register to the BSF as the PCF serving this UE, if not already registered at the AM Policy Association establishment. This is performed by using the Nbsf_Management_Register operation, providing as inputs the UE SUPI/GPSI and the PCF identity.\n5.\tThe (V-) PCF sends a Npcf_UEPolicyControl Create Response to the AMF. The (V-)PCF relays the Policy Control Request Trigger parameters in the Npcf_UEPolicyControl Create Response.\nThe (V-)PCF also subscribes to notification of N1 message delivery of policy information to the UE using Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageSubscribe service which is not shown in this figure.\n6.\tThe (H-)PCF gets policy subscription related information and the latest list of PSIs from the UDR using Nudr_DM_Query service operation (SUPI, Policy Data, UE context policy control data, Policy Set Entry) if either or both are not available and makes a policy decision. The (H-)PCF may get the PEI, the OSId, indication of UE capability of reporting URSP rule enforcement to network or the indication of UE support for ANDSP in the UDR using Nudr_DM_Query including DataSet \"Policy Data\" and Data Subset \"UE context policy control data\" if the AMF relocates and the PCF changes. In the roaming scenario, the H-PCF may provide the indication of UE support for ANDSP to the V-PCF, if the indication was not present in the Npcf_UEPolicyControl Create request from V-PCF and the H-PCF gets this information from the H-UDR. The (H-)PCF may get the 5G VN group data and 5G VN group membership for each Internal-Group-ID received from the AMF using Nudr_DM_Query (Internal-Group-Id, Subscription Data, 5G VN Group Configuration). The (H-)PCF may store the 5G VN group data and 5G VN group membership for later use for other SUPIs that belong to the same Internal-Group-ID. The (H-)PCF may request notifications from the UDR on changes in the subscription information by invoking Nudr_DM_Subscribe (Policy Data, SUPI, DNN, S-NSSAI, Notification Target Address (+ Notification Correlation Id), Event Reporting Information (continuous reporting), UE context policy control data) service. The (H-)PCF may request notifications from the UDR on changes in the 5G VN group data or 5G VN group membership associated to each of the Internal-Group-Id provided to the PCF by invoking Nudr_DM_Subscribe (Subscription Data, 5G VN Group Configuration, Internal Group ID, Notification Target Address (+ Notification Correlation Id), Event Reporting Information (continuous reporting)) service. The (H-)PCF creates the UE policy container including UE policy information as defined in clause 6.6 of TS 23.503 [20] and in the case of roaming H-PCF provides the UE policy container in the Npcf_UEPolicyControl_UpdateNotify Request. In the non-roaming case, the PCF may subscribe to Analytics from NWDAF as defined in clause 6.1.1.3 of TS 23.503 [20].\n7.\tThe V-PCF sends a response to H-PCF using Npcf_UEPolicyControl_UpdateNotify Response.\nNOTE 2:\tStep 6 (and step 7) can be omitted. Then the (H-)PCF creates the UE policy container including UE polices in step 2 (in the case of non-roaming) or step 3 (in the case of roaming). This means that the potential interactions with UDR as in step 6 will have to be executed in step 2 (non-roaming) or step 3 (roaming).\n8.\tThe (V-)PCF triggers UE Configuration Update Procedure in clause 4.2.4.3 to sends the UE policy container including UE policy information to the UE. The (V-)PCF checks the size limit as described in clause 6.1.2.2.2 of TS 23.503 [20].\n9.\tIf the V-PCF received notification of the reception of the UE Policy container then the V-PCF forwards the notification response of the UE to the H-PCF using Npcf_UEPolicyControl_Update Request.\nIf the V-PCF is notified by the V-UDR about the Service Specific Information applicable to inbound roamers from the HPLMN of the UE as specified in clause 4.15.6.10, the V-PCF provides the Service Parameters to the H-PCF.\n10.\tThe H-PCF sends a response to the V-PCF.

The value for Reporting Threshold is set by the PCF based on operator configuration.\n2.\tThe PCF is notified with the Network Performance analytics or DN Performance analytics in the area of interest from the NWDAF when the NWDAF determines that the Network Performance or DN Performance reaches the Reporting Threshold as described for the Network Performance analytics or DN Performance analytics in TS 23.288 [50].\n3.\tThe H-PCF requests from the UDR the stored PDTQ policies using Nudr_DM_Query (Policy Data, Planned Data Transfer with QoS requirements) service operation.\n4.\tThe UDR provides all the PDTQ Policies together with the relevant information received from the AFs (as defined in clause 6.1.2.7 of TS 23.503 [20]) to the H-PCF.\n5.\tThe H-PCF identifies the PDTQ Policies affected based on the notification received from NWDAF.

The PCF then performs the following steps for each of the determined ASPs, i.e. Steps 6 - 11 can occur multiple times (i.e. once per ASP).\n6.\tThe PCF decides based on operator policies, whether a new list of candidate PDTQ policies can be calculated for the ASP.

In this case, the AF response only includes PDTQ reference ID, but no PDTQ policy and the previously negotiated PDTQ policy shall be kept.\nThe AF can send a Stop notification by invoking Nnef_PDTQPolicyNegotiation_Update service, when the AF requests not to receive the PDTQ warning notification anymore.

      "content": "The signalling flow for a MA PDU Session establishment when the UE is not roaming, or when the UE is roaming and the PDU Session Anchor (PSA) is located in the VPLMN, is based on the signalling flow in Figure 4.3.2.2.1-1 with the following differences and clarifications:\n-\tThe PDU Session Establishment Request message may be sent over the 3GPP access or over the non-3GPP access. In the steps below, it is assumed that it is sent over the 3GPP access, unless otherwise specified.\n-\tIn step 1, the UE provides Request Type as \"MA PDU Request\" in UL NAS Transport message and its ATSSS Capabilities as defined in clause 5.32.2 of TS 23.501 [2] in PDU Session Establishment Request message.\nThe \"MA PDU Request\" Request Type in the UL NAS Transport message indicates to the network that this PDU Session Establishment Request is to establish a new MA PDU Session and to apply one or more steering functionalities (defined in TS 23.501 [2], clause 5.32.6) for steering the traffic of this MA PDU session over multiple accesses.\nIf the UE requests an S-NSSAI and the UE is registered over both accesses, it shall request an S-NSSAI that is allowed on both accesses.\nThe UE indicates to AMF whether it supports non-3GPP access path switching, i.e. whether the UE can transfer the non-3GPP access path of the MA PDU Session from a source non-3GPP access (N3IWF/TNGF) to a target non-3GPP access (a different N3IWF/TNGF).\n-\tIn step 2, if the AMF supports MA PDU sessions, then the AMF selects an SMF, which supports MA PDU sessions. If the AMF supports non-3GPP access path switching and the UE indicated in step 1 that the UE supports non-3GPP access path switching, the AMF selects a SMF that supports non-3GPP access path switching, if such an SMF is available.\n-\tIn step 3, the AMF informs the SMF that the request is for a MA PDU Session by including \"MA PDU Request\" indication and in addition, it indicates to SMF whether the UE is registered over both accesses. If the AMF determines that the UE is registered via both accesses, but the requested S-NSSAI is not allowed on both accesses, then the AMF shall reject the MA PDU session establishment. If the AMF supports non-3GPP access path switching while maintaining two N2 connections for non-3GPP access, the selected SMF supports non-3GPP path switching and UE indicated in step 1 that the UE supports non-3GPP access path switching, the AMF indicates whether the UE supports non-3GPP path switching to the SMF.\nThe AMF shall reject the PDU Session Establishment request if the request is for a LADN.\n-\tIn step 4, the SMF retrieves, via Session Management subscription data, the information whether the MA PDU session is allowed or not.\n-\tIn step 7, if dynamic PCC is to be used for the MA PDU Session, the SMF sends an \"MA PDU Request\" indication to the PCF in the SM Policy Control Create message and the ATSSS Capabilities of the MA PDU session. The SMF provides the currently used Access Type(s) and RAT Type(s) to the PCF. The PCF decides whether the MA PDU session is allowed or not based on operator policy and subscription data.\nThe PCF provides PCC rules that include MA PDU session control information, as specified in TS 23.503 [20]. From the received PCC rules, the SMF derives (a) ATSSS rules, which will be sent to UE for controlling the traffic steering, switching and splitting in the uplink direction and (b) N4 rules, which will be sent to UPF for controlling the traffic steering, switching and splitting in the downlink direction. If the UE indicates the support of \"ATSSS-LL Capability\", the SMF may derive the Measurement Assistance Information.\nIf the SMF receives a UP Security Policy for the PDU Session with Integrity Protection set to \"Required\" and the MA PDU session is being established over non-3GPP access, the SMF does not verify whether the access can satisfy the UP Security Policy.\n-\tIn the remaining steps of Figure 4.3.2.2.1-1, the SMF establishes the user-plane resources over the 3GPP access, i.e. over the access where the PDU Session Establishment Request was sent on:\n-\tIn step 10, the N4 rules derived by SMF for the MA PDU session are sent to UPF and two N3 UL CN tunnels info are allocated by the UPF. If the ATSSS LL functionality is supported for MA PDU Session, the SMF may instruct the UPF to initiate performance measurement for this MA PDU Session. If the MPTCP functionality and/or the MPQUIC functionality is supported for the MA PDU Session, the SMF may instruct the UPF to activate the MPTCP functionality and/or the MPQUIC functionality for this MA PDU Session. In step 10a, the UPF allocates addressing information for the Performance Measurement Function (PMF) in the UPF. If the UPF receives from the SMF a list of QoS flows over which access performance measurements may be performed, the UPF allocates different UDP ports or different MAC addresses per QoS flow per access. In step 10b, the UPF sends the addressing information for the PMF in the UPF to the SMF. If UDP ports or MAC addresses are allocated per QoS flow and per access, the UPF sends the PMF IP address information and UDP ports with the related QFI to the SMF in the case of IP PDU sessions and sends the MAC addresses with the related QFI to the SMF in the case of Ethernet PDU sessions.\nIn step 10a, if the message from the SMF instructs the UPF to activate MPTCP functionality, the UPF allocates the UE \"MPTCP link-specific multipath\" addresses/prefixes. In step 10b, the UPF sends the \"MPTCP link-specific multipath\" addresses/prefixes and MPTCP proxy information to the SMF. If the message from the SMF instructs the UPF to activate MPQUIC functionality, the UPF allocates the UE \"MPQUIC link-specific multipath\" addresses/prefixes. In step 10b, the UPF sends the \"MPQUIC link-specific multipath\" addresses/prefixes and MPQUIC proxy information to the SMF. The \"MPTCP link-specific multipath\" addresses/prefixes and the \"MPQUIC link-specific multipath\" addresses/prefixes may be the same.\n-\tIn step 11, for the MA PDU session, the SMF includes an \"MA PDU session Accepted\" indication in the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer message to the AMF and indicates to AMF that the N2 SM Information included in this message should be sent over 3GPP access. The AMF marks this PDU session as MA PDU session based on the received \"MA PDU session Accepted\" indication. If the AMF indicated in step 3 that non-3GPP path switching while maintaining two N2 connections for non-3GPP access is supported, the SMF indicates support of non-3GPP path switching in the PDU Session Establishment Accept message.\n-\tIn step 13, the UE receives a PDU Session Establishment Accept message, which indicates to UE that the requested MA PDU session was successfully established. This message includes the ATSSS rules for the MA PDU session, which were derived by SMF. If the ATSSS -LL functionality is supported for the PDU Session, the SMF may include the addressing information of PMF in the UPF into the Measurement Assistance Information. If the MPTCP functionality is supported for the MA PDU Session, the SMF shall include the \"MPTCP link-specific multipath\" addresses/prefixes of the UE and the MPTCP proxy information. If the MPQUIC functionality is supported for the MA PDU Session, the SMF shall include the \"MPQUIC link-specific multipath\" addresses/prefixes of the UE and the MPQUIC proxy information.\n-\tAfter step 18 in Figure 4.3.2.2.1-1, if the SMF was informed in step 2 that the UE is registered over both accesses, then the SMF initiates the establishment of user-plane resources over non-3GPP access too. The SMF sends an Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer to the AMF including N2 SM Information and indicates to AMF that the N2 SM Information should be sent over non-3GPP access. Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer does not include an N1 SM Container for the UE because this was sent to UE in step 13. After this step, the two N3 tunnels between the PSA and RAN/AN are established.\nThe last step above is not executed when the UE is registered over one access only, in which case the MA PDU Session is established with user-plane resources over one access only. How user-plane resources can be added over an access of the MA PDU Session is specified in clause 4.22.7.",

The UE indicates to AMF whether it supports non-3GPP access path switching.\n-\tIn step 2, if the AMF supports MA PDU sessions, then the AMF selects a V-SMF and an H-SMF, which supports MA PDU sessions. The V-SMF serves the UE over both accesses. If the AMF supports non-3GPP access path switching and the UE indicated in step 1 that the UE supports non-3GPP access path switching, the AMF selects a V-SMF and H-SMF supporting non-3GPP access path switching, if such a V-SMF and H-SMF are available.\n-\tIn step 3, the AMF informs the SMF that the request is for a MA PDU Session by including an \"MA PDU Request\" indication and in addition, the AMF indicates to V-SMF that the UE is registered over both accesses. If the AMF supports non-3GPP access path switching while maintaining two N2 connections for non-3GPP access, the selected SMFs supports non-3GPP path switching and UE indicated in step 1 that the UE supports non-3GPP access path switching, the AMF indicates whether the UE supports non-3GPP path switching to the V-SMF.\n-\tIn step 5, two DL N9 tunnel CN info and two UL N3 tunnel CN info are allocated by the V-SMF or by the V-UPF.\n-\tIn step 6, the V-SMF informs the H-SMF that the request is for a MA PDU Session by including an \"MA PDU Request\" indication and indicates to H-SMF that the UE is registered over both accesses. The V-SMF indicates to H-SMF the relationship between the DL N9 tunnel CN info and the access type. If the single CN Tunnel is established by the H-SMF, the DL N9 tunnel info binding to the access over which the NAS message is received is to be used.\n-\tIn step 7, the H-SMF retrieves, via Session Management subscription data, the information whether the MA PDU session is allowed or not.\n-\tIn step 9, if dynamic PCC is to be used for the MA PDU Session, the H-SMF sends an \"MA PDU Request\" indication to H-PCF in the SM Policy Control Create message and the ATSSS Capabilities of the MA PDU session. The H-SMF provides the currently used list of Access Type(s) and RAT Type(s) for the MA-PDU session to the H-PCF. The H-PCF decides whether the MA PDU session is allowed or not based on operator policy and subscription data.\nThe H-PCF provides the PCC rules containing MA PDU session control information and the H-SMF derives the ATSSS rules for the UE and the N4 rules for the H-UPF.\n-\tIn step 12, two UL N9 tunnel CN info are allocated by the H-SMF or by the H-UPF. After this step, the two N9 tunnels between the H-UPF and V-UPF are established.\n-\tIn step 13, the H-SMF sends \"MA PDU session Accepted\" indication to V-SMF in the Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Response message. The H-SMF indicates to V-SMF the relationship between the UL N9 tunnel CN info and the access type.\n-\tIn step 14, the V-SMF sends the \"MA PDU session Accepted\" indication in the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer message to the AMF and indicates the AMF to send the N2 SM Information included in this message over the access that the UE sent the PDU Session Establishment Request. The AMF marks this PDU session as MA PDU session based on the received \"MA PDU session Accepted\" indication.\nThe V-SMF indicates support of non-3GPP path switching in the PDU Session Establishment Accept message.\nIf the V-SMF received two UL N9 tunnel CN info from the H-SMF, the V-SMF also initiates the establishment of user-plane resources over the other access. The V-SMF sends an N1N2 Message Transfer to AMF including N2 SM Information and the other access type to indicate to AMF that the N2 SM Information should be sent over the other access. The N1N2 Message Transfer does not include an N1 SM Container for the UE which was sent to UE over the access that the UE sent the PDU Session Establishment Request.\n-\tIn step 16, the UE receives a PDU Session Establishment Accept message, which indicates to UE that the requested MA PDU session was successfully established. This message includes the ATSSS rules for the MA PDU session, which were derived by H-SMF and may include Measurement Assistance Information.\n-\tAfter step 20, if the V-SMF was informed in step 3 that the UE is registered over both accesses, then the V-SMF initiates the establishment of user-plane resources over the other access too. The V-SMF sends an N1N2 Message Transfer to the AMF including N2 SM Information and indicates to the AMF over which access the N2 SM Information should be sent. The N1N2 Message Transfer does not include an N1 SM Container for the UE because this was sent to the UE in step 14. After this step, two N9 tunnels between the H-UPF and the V-UPF as well as two N3 tunnels between the V-UPF and RAN/AN are established, or, if the H-UPF is connected to two different V-UPFs, the H-UPF has one N9 tunnel with each V-UPF.",

In this case, multi-access connectivity using ATSSS via both 3GPP access to EPC and non-3GPP access to 5GC may be provided as described in this clause.\nFor this scenario, the general principles for ATSSS as described in clause 5.32 of TS 23.501 [2] apply, with the additions provided in this clause 4.22.2.3.\nA Multi-Access PDU Session may be extended with user-plane resources via an associated PDN Connection on 3GPP access in EPC. This enables a scenario where a MA PDU Session can simultaneously be associated with user-plane resources on 3GPP access network connected to EPC and non-3GPP access connected to 5GC. Such a PDN Connection in EPS would thus be associated with multi-access capability in the UE and PGW-C+SMF.\nNOTE:\tTo the MME and SGW this is a regular PDN Connection and the support for ATSSS is transparent to MME and SGW.\nThe UE may operate in either single-registration mode or dual-registration mode in 3GPP access. Irrespective of whether the UE operates in single-registration mode or dual-registration mode in 3GPP access, it is assumed that the UE supports simultaneous registrations for non-3GPP access in 5GC and 3GPP access in EPC.\nThe ATSSS rules are provided from the PGW-C+SMF to the UE via SM NAS signalling over 5GC, as described in clause 5.32.2 of TS 23.501 [2].

After the MA PDU Session establishment in 5GS/non-3GPP access, the description in clause 5.32.2 of TS 23.501 [2], applies with the following additions:\n-\tIf the UE is registered to EPC and wants to add user-plane resources on 3GPP access over EPC, then the UE shall send a PDN Connection Establishment Request over this access containing a \"handover\" indication and include a \"MA PDU Request\" indication in the PCO as well as the PDU Session ID of the existing MA PDU Session on non-3GPP access over 5GC.\n-\tWhen the UE deregisters from the EPC access (but remains registered on the 5GC access), the MME will notify the PGW-C+SMF that the PDN Connection is released, as described in TS 23.401 [13]. The SMF can then notify the UPF that the access type has become unavailable.\nIn order to support EPS interworking when Ethernet type PDN Connection is not supported in EPS, the UE may use non-IP type PDN Connection when the UE establishes a PDN Connection in EPS as an added 3GPP access leg of an Ethernet type MA PDU Session. In this case, the UE and SMF shall locally associate the PDN Connection as an Ethernet type PDU Session as described in TS 23.501 [2]. When Ethernet type PDN Connection is not supported in EPS, the UE does not request to establish a PDN Connection with \"MA PDU Request\" indication before the UE registers to 5GS and establishes MA PDU Session over non-3GPP access.\nA UE that has an established MA-PDU session over non-3GPP access in 5GC and 3GPP access in EPS, may be able to use EN-DC for the 3GPP access leg.\nDepending on the RAT types supported by the UE, the PDN connection may also be handed over to 3GPP access in 5GC. For a UE supporting both E-UTRAN/EPC access and NG-RAN/5GC access, the user plane resources for 3GPP access may be moved between E-UTRAN/EPC access and NG-RAN/5GC access as described in clause 5.17.2 of TS 23.501 [2].

This mapping is e.g. based on operator configuration and may result in that multiple QoS flows are mapped to a single EPS bearer. The PGW-C+SMF applies the appropriate QoS signalling in each access, e.g. to manage dedicated bearers in the access associated with EPC and QoS flows in the access associated with 5GC. The PGW-C+SMF also provides N4 rules to UPF for performing QoS enforcement and for mapping downlink traffic to appropriate GTP-U tunnels.\nAs described in clause 5.32.4 of TS 23.501 [2], for a GBR QoS flow, the QoS profile is provided to a single access network at a given time. GBR QoS flows (and associated MBR, GBR) are thus only enforced in either the access associated to EPC or the access associated to 5GC.

The PGW-C+SMF provides the following information via the APCO in the Create Session Response message to the ePDG:\n-\tAn indication whether the request for using the PDN Connection for MA-PDU Session is accepted or not.\n-\tIf the UE has indicated that it is capable of supporting the MPTCP functionality and the PGW-C+SMF accepts to activate the MPTCP functionality, then the network provides MPTCP proxy information to the UE, as described in clause 5.32.2 of TS 23.501 [2].\n-\tIf the UE has indicated that it is capable of supporting the MPQUIC functionality and the PGW-C+SMF accepts to activate the MPQUIC functionality, then the network provides MPQUIC proxy information to the UE, as described in clause 5.32.2 of TS 23.501 [2].\n-\tUE Measurement Assistance Information (as described in clause 5.32.2 of TS 23.501 [2]).\n-\tATSSS rules\n-\tThe ePDG forwards the received above information to the UE via IKE signalling.\nAfter the PDN Connection establishment:\n-\tIf the UE registers to 5GC and wants to add 3GPP user-plane resources, then the UE shall send a PDU Session Establishment Request over this access containing a \"MA PDU Request\" indication as described in clause 5.32.2 of TS 23.501 [2]. The AMF shall select the SMF according to the UE context in SMF data from UDM for the corresponding PDU Session ID.\n-\tIf the UE attaches in E-UTRAN/EPC, the UE shall not trigger PDN Connection establishment to add E-UTRAN/EPC access to the MA PDU Session.\nWhen the UE wants to request a new MA PDU Session in 5GC/3GPP access, the description in clause 5.32.2 of TS 23.501 [2], applies. After the MA PDU Session establishment in 5GC/3GPP access, the description in clause 5.32.2 of TS 23.501 [2], applies with the following additions:\n-\tIf the UE is registered to EPC and wants to add user-plane resources on non-3GPP access over EPC, then the UE shall send a PDN Connection Establishment Request over this access containing the IP address of the MA PDU Session in CFG_REQUEST Configuration Payload and include a \"MA PDU Request\" indication and UE's ATSSS capabilities and the PDU Session ID of the existing MA PDU Session on 3GPP access over 5GC. The ePDG shall select the PGW-C/SMF corresponding to the PGW identity provided by the 3GPP AAA server as described in TS 23.402 [26]. The ePDG forwards the ATSSS information via the APCO in the Create Session Request message to the PGW-C/SMF.\n-\tWhen the UE deregisters from the EPC/non-3GPP access (but remains registered on the 5GC/3GPP access), the ePDG will notify the PGW-C+SMF that the PDN Connection is released, as described in TS 23.402 [26]. The SMF can then notify the UPF that the access type has become unavailable.\nA UE that has an established MA-PDU session over 3GPP access in 5GC and non-3GPP access in EPS, may be able to use Dual Connectivity for the 3GPP access leg.\nDepending on the RAT types supported by the UE, the PDU Session may also be handed over to 3GPP access in EPC. For a UE supporting both E-UTRAN/EPC access and NG-RAN/5GC access, the user plane resources for 3GPP access may be moved between E-UTRAN/EPC access and NG-RAN/5GC access as described in clause 5.17.2 of TS 23.501 [2]. For the MA PDU session over 3GPP access in 5GC and non-3GPP access in EPS, when a UE moves from NG-RAN/5GC to E-UTRAN/EPC, the SMF+PGW-C may release the user plane resources either over 3GPP access or non-3GPP access based on operator policy. In this case, while the UE remains in EPC in both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access, the UE shall not trigger PDN Connection establishment to add an additional EPC access leg to the MA PDU Session. If the SMF+PGW-C does not release the user plane resources over one of accesses, the UE sends traffic over both accesses based on ATSSS rules.",

      "content": "If the UE supports non-3GPP access path switching and the AMF indicates that the network supports non-3GPP access path switching as described in clause 4.22.2, the UE may trigger a Mobility Registration Update via a new non-3GPP access to switch traffic from an old non-3GPP access (i.e. TNGF or N3IWF) to the new non-3GPP access (i.e. TNGF or N3IWF) if the PLMN of the selected new non-3GPP access is the same PLMN of the old non-3GPP access.\nThe UE may trigger non-3GPP path switching if the AMF indicated support during registration as described in clause 4.22.9.1, even if the SMF did not indicate support to the UE during the MA PDU Session Establishment.\nIn this case the Registration procedure described in clause 4.22.9.1 applies with the differences and clarifications described in this clause:\nFigure 4.22.9.5-1: Mobility Registration procedure for non-3GPP access path switching\n1.\tThis is the same as step 1 in clause 4.22.9.1, with the following additions:\n-\tIf the UE wants to switch the user plane from an old non-3GPP access to a new non-3GPP access where the Mobility Registration Update is sent, the UE indicates PDU Session ID(s) of the PDU Session(s) in the List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated. This may include both PDU Session ID(s) corresponding to MA PDU Sessions and single access PDU Sessions.\nNOTE 1:\tThe PDU Sessions that are not indicated in the List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated by the UE are not released but deactivated during the switching procedure. The UE or network can re-activate user plane resources by triggering Service Request procedure after non-3GPP path switching is completed.\nThe UE may also provide an (\"Non-3GPP access path switching while using old AN resources\") indication in the Registration Request to indicate that the UP connection(s) via the old non-3GPP access can still be used for the MA PDU Session(s) during the Registration procedure. If the UP connection(s) via the old non-3GPP access cannot be used by the UE during the Registration procedure, the UE shall not provide a \"Non-3GPP access path switching while using old AN resources\" indication.\nThe UE shall not perform non-3GPP access path switching if the PLMN of the selected new non-3GPP access is different from the PLMN of the old non-3GPP access.\n2.\tThis is the same as step 2 in Figure 4.2.2.2.2-1.\n3.\tThis is the same as step 3 in Figure 4.2.2.2.2-1 with the following additions:\n-\tIf the UE provided an (\"Non-3GPP access path switching while using old AN resources\") indication in step 1 and the AMF supports to maintain two N2 connections for non-3GPP access during the Registration procedure and the SMF supports non-3GPP access path switching, the AMF delays the release of the old N2 connection until the UP connection via the new non-3GPP access is established. Otherwise, the AMF may trigger AN release towards the old non-3GPP access before proceeding with the Registration procedure in the new non-3GPP access, as described in clause 4.12.4.2 for untrusted non-3GPP access and clause 4.12a.4.2 for trusted non-3GPP access with the following clarifications:\n-\tDuring the AN release procedure, the AMF should notify the SMF to release the UP resources for the activated PDU Sessions before sending the N2 UE Context Release Command to the old non-3GPP access.\n-\tDue to pending downlink data in the UPF, the SMF may requests to establish user plane resources before non-3GPP path switching is finished. In this case, the AMF may reject the request with an indication that the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer has been temporarily rejected. Upon reception of an Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer response with an indication that its request has been temporarily rejected, the SMF shall start a locally configured guard timer and wait for any message to come from an AMF. Upon reception of a message from an AMF, the SMF shall re-invoke the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer (with N2 SM info and/or N1 SM info) to the AMF.\n4.\tThis is the same as steps 4-16 in Figure 4.2.2.2.2-1.\n5-11.\tThese steps are the same as step 17 in clause 4.22.9.1, with the following additions:\n-\tIf the Registration procedure is triggered to switch traffic from the old non-3GPP access to the new non-3GPP access and the UE provided an (\"Non-3GPP access path switching while using old AN resources\") indication in step 1, the AMF, if it supports maintaining two N2 connections for non-3GPP access, forwards this indication to the SMF in case the PDU Session is a MA PDU Session. If the SMF receives this indication, the SMF does not trigger release of the UP connection in the old non-3GPP access towards the old N3IWF or TNGF (if any).\n-\tIn step 7 and 8, the CN Tunnel Info is sent from SMF to the new non-3GPP AN via AMF. The IPSec child SA(s) between UE and the new non-3GPP AN are established.\n-\tIn step 10, the SMF updates the N4 rules by replacing the AN Tunnel Info of the old non-3GPP AN with the AN Tunnel Info of the new non-3GPP AN to instruct the UPF to switch traffic from the old non-3GPP access path to the new non-3GPP access path.\nNOTE 2:\tThe resource in the old non-3GPP access, i.e. the old N3IWF or TNGF, will in this case be released by the AMF in step 12.\n-\tAfter the UP connection via the new non-3GPP access is established, the UE and UPF start to send traffic via the new non-3GPP access.\n12.\tAfter the UP connection has been established in new non-3GPP access, the AMF also triggers AN release towards the old non-3GPP access (i.e. old N3IWF or TNGF), unless done previously with following clarifications:\n-\tFor the PDU Sessions indicated by the old non-3GPP access in the \"List of PDU Session ID(s) with active N3 user plane\" but not in the List Of PDU Sessions To Be Activated sent by the UE in step 1, the AMF requests the SMF to deactivate the PDU Session(s). For other PDU Sessions, the AMF shall not request the SMF to deactivate the PDU Session(s).\n-\tWhen the UE receives Registration Accept over the new non-3GPP access, the UE considers that the UE is deregistered from the old non-3GPP access.\nNOTE 3:\tIn order to support RAT restrictions for non-3GPP access in the above procedure, it is assumed that UDM has provided restricted non-3GPP RAT types, if any, in the RAT restriction parameter in AM subscription data. In order to ensure that RAT restrictions are not violated in case the PDU Session is established in LBO roaming scenarios, the AMF in VPLMN may be configured to not indicate support for non-3GPP access path switching for inbound roaming UEs during MA PDU Session Establishment towards a SMF in VPLMN, unless it has been agreed in roaming agreements that non-3GPP access path switching can be supported for such UEs.",

When an AMF detects the need to change the V-SMF while the H-SMF does not support V-SMF change, the AMF shall not trigger the V-SMF change but shall trigger the release of the PDU Session.\nFor an established PDU session an I-SMF is inserted if the UE is not in the SMF Service Area. In this case, when an UE moves from HPLMN to a VPLMN, a V-SMF is inserted and the I-SMF is removed. For mobility from VPLMN to HPLMN, an I-SMF is inserted and the V-SMF is removed. The procedures of this clause apply in this case, i.e. by replacing the target or new I-SMF by a V-SMF for mobility from HPLMN to VPLMN and by replacing the source or old I-SMF by a V-SMF for mobility from VPLMN to HPLMN.\nFor additional consideration for Home-routed PDU sessions see clause 4.23.17.\nIf at UE mobility the service area of the SMF does not include the location where the UE camps and the PDU Session is a MA PDU Session, then the AMF initiates the release of the MA PDU Session over all accesses served by this AMF. This applies to following procedures:\n-\tRegistration as defined in clause 4.23.3,\n-\tService Request as defined in clause 4.23.4,\n-\tXn Hand-over as defined in clause 4.23.11, or\n-\tN2 Hand-Over as defined in clause 4.23.7.\nFor an established PDU Session supporting mechanisms for redundant transmission defined in clause 5.33.2 of TS 23.501 [2], or for a PDU Session supporting Time Sensitive Communications as defined in clauses 5.27 and 5.28 of TS 23.501 [2], if the UE moves out of SMF Service Area, the SMF may, based on local policy, release the PDU Session after the mobility procedure. This applies to following procedures: Registration procedure, Service Request procedure, Xn based handover procedure, N2 based handover procedure.\nIf dynamic CN PDB needs to be configured by the SMF and the I-SMF is involved in the PDU session, the I-SMF receives the Dynamic CN PDB value as part of QoS profile from SMF (over N16a) and forwards it to (R)AN via N2 SM message.",

The I-SMF may also include UE location Information, Time Zone RAT type, Access Type and Operation Type set to \"UP Activate\", if those information is changed and need to be notified to SMF. If DL Tunnel Info of new intermediate UPF is received, the SMF provides the DL Tunnel Info of new intermediate UPF received from I-SMF to UPF(PSA).\n-\tStep 10, this step does not apply as in this scenario the I-UPF is always needed.\n-\tStep 16, If the I-SMF needs to update SMF with e.g. change of UE location information, change of Time Zone, change of RAT type and/or change of Access type, the I-SMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request to send User Location Information, Time Zone, RAT type and/or Access Type to SMF. If the I-SMF invoked Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request in step 7a with Operation Type \"UP Activate\", the I-SMF also includes an Operation Type set to \"UP Activated\".\nIf dynamic PCC is deployed and if Policy Control Request Trigger condition(s) have been met (e.g. change of Access Type, change of UE location), the SMF performs SMF initiated SM Policy Modification procedure as defined in clause 4.16.5.1 and may get the updated policy.\n-\tSteps 18a-18b, these steps do not apply as in this scenario the I-UPF is always needed.\n-\tStep 21a, this step does not apply as in this scenario the I-UPF is always needed.",

      "content": "When, as part of a UE Triggered Service Request, I-SMF is to be inserted, changed or removed, the procedure in this clause is used. It includes the following cases:\n-\tthe UE moves from SMF service area to new I-SMF service area, a new I-SMF is inserted (i.e. I-SMF insertion); or\n-\tthe UE moves from old I-SMF service area to new I-SMF service area, the I-SMF is changed (i.e. I-SMF change); or\n-\tthe UE moves from old I-SMF service area to SMF service area, the old I-SMF is removed (i.e. I-SMF removal).\nIf the service request is triggered by network due to downlink data and a new I-UPF is selected, forwarding tunnel is established between the old I-UPF(if the old I-UPF is different from PSA) and the new I-UPF to forward buffered data.\nFor Home Routed Roaming case, the I-SMF (old and new) and I-UPF (old and new) are located in Visited PLMN, while the SMF and UPF(PSA) are located in the Home PLMN. In this HR roaming case only the case of I-SMF change applies (there is always a V-SMF for the PDU Session).\nFigure 4.23.4.3-1: UE Triggered Service Request procedure with I-SMF insertion/change/removal\n1.\tSame as the steps 1-3 defined clause 4.2.3.2.\n2.\tThe AMF determines whether new I-SMF needs to be selected based on UE location and service area of the SMF, if new I-SMF needs to be selected, the AMF selects a new I-SMF as described in clause 4.23.2.\nCase: I-SMF insertion or I-SMF change, steps 3-9 are skipped for I-SMF removal case.\n3.\tIf the AMF has selected a new I-SMF, the AMF sends a Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request (PDU Session ID, SM Context ID, UE location info, Access Type, RAT Type, Operation Type) to the new I-SMF. The SM Context ID points to the old I-SMF in the case of I-SMF change or to SMF in the case of I-SMF insertion.\nThe AMF Set the Operation Type to \"UP activate\" to indicate establishment of N3 tunnel User Plane resources for the PDU Session(s). The AMF determines Access Type and RAT Type based on the Global RAN Node ID associated with the N2 interface.\nIf the UE Time Zone has changed compared to the last reported UE Time Zone then the AMF shall include the UE Time Zone IE in this message.\n4a.\tThe new I-SMF retrieves SM Context from the old I-SMF (in the case of I-SMF change) or SMF (in the case of I-SMF insertion) by invoking Nsmf_PDUSession_Context Request (SM context type, SM Context ID). The new I-SMF uses SM Context ID received from AMF for this service operation. SM Context ID is used by the recipient of Nsmf_PDUSession_Context Request in order to determine the targeted PDU Session. SM context type indicates that the requested information is all SM context, i.e. PDN Connection Context and 5G SM context.\n4b.\tThe old I-SMF in the case of I-SMF change or SMF in the case of I-SMF insertion responds with the SM context of the indicated PDU Session.\nIf there is Extended Buffering is applied and the Extended Buffering timer is still running in old-SMF or old I-UPF, or the service request is triggered by downlink data, the old I-SMF or SMF includes a forwarding indication in the response to indicate that a forwarding tunnel is needed for sending buffered downlink packets. For I-SMF insertion, if I-UPF controlled by SMF was available for the PDU Session, the SMF includes a forwarding indication.\n5.\tThe new I-SMF selects a new I-UPF: Based on the received SM context, e.g. S-NSSAI and UE location information, the new I-SMF selects a new I-UPF as described in clause 6.3.3 of TS 23.501 [2].\n6.\tThe new I-SMF initiates a N4 Session Establishment to the new I-UPF. The new I-UPF provide tunnel endpoints to the new I-SMF.\nIf forwarding indication was received, the new I-SMF also requests the new I-UPF to allocate tunnel endpoints to receive the buffered DL data from the old I-UPF and to indicate end marker reception on this tunnel via usage reporting. In this case, the new I-UPF begins to buffer the downlink packet(s) received from the UPF (PSA).\n7a. If the tunnel endpoints for the buffered DL data were allocated, the new I-SMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request (tunnel endpoints for buffered DL data) to the old I-SMF in the case of I-SMF change in order to establish the forwarding tunnel. The new I-SMF uses the SM Context ID received from AMF for this service operation.\n7b.\tThe old I-SMF, in the case of I-SMF change initiates a N4 session modification to the old I-UPF to send the tunnel endpoints for buffered DL data to the old I-UPF. After this step, the old I-UPF starts to send buffered DL data to the new I-UPF.\nIf the old I-UPF receives end marker packets and there is no associated tunnel to forward these packets, the old I-UPF discards the received end marker packets and does not send any Data Notification to SMF.\n7c.\tThe old I-SMF, in the case of I-SMF change responds the new I-SMF with Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext response.\n8a.\tIn the case of I-SMF change, the new I-SMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request (SM Context ID, new I-UPF DL tunnel information, SM Context ID at I-SMF, Access Type, RAT Type, DNAI list supported by the new I-SMF, Operation Type) towards the SMF. The new I-SMF uses the SM Context ID at SMF received from old I-SMF for this service operation.\nIn the case of I-SMF insertion, the new I-SMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Request (new I-UPF DL tunnel information, new I-UPF tunnel endpoint for buffered DL data, SM Context ID at I-SMF, Access Type, RAT type, DNAI list supported by the new I-SMF, Operation Type) towards the SMF.\nThe SM Context ID at I-SMF is to be used by the SMF for further PDU Session operation, e.g. to notify the new I-SMF of PDU Session Release. If SM Context ID at the I-SMF exists (i.e. in the case of I-SMF change), the SMF shall replace the SM Context ID at I-SMF.\nThe new I-UPF tunnel endpoint for buffered DL data is used to establish the forwarding tunnel (from old I-UPF controlled by SMF to new I-UPF controlled by new I-SMF).\nIf the old I-UPF receives end marker packets and there is no associated tunnel to forward these packets, the old I-UPF discards the received end marker packets and does not send any Data Notification to SMF.\nThe Operation Type is set to \"UP activate\" to indicate that User Plane resource for the PDU Session is to be established.\n8b.\tThe SMF initiates N4 Session Modification toward the PDU Session Anchor UPF. During this step:\n-\tThe SMF provides the new I-UPF DL tunnel information.\n-\tIf different CN Tunnel Info need be used by PSA UPF, i.e. the CN Tunnel Info at the PSA for N3 and N9 are different, a CN Tunnel Info for the PDU Session Anchor UPF is allocated.\n-\tFor I-SMF insertion, if a new I-UPF tunnel endpoint for buffered DL data is received, the SMF triggers the transfer of buffered DL data to the new I-UPF tunnel endpoint for buffered DL data.\nIf the DL tunnel information has changed, the SMF indicates the UPF (PSA) to send one or more \"end marker\" packets for each N9 tunnel to the old I-UPF immediately after switching the path to new I-UPF. From now on the PDU Session Anchor UPF begins to send the DL data to the new I-UPF as indicated in the new I-UPF DL tunnel information. The UPF (PSA) sends one or more \"end marker\" packets for each N9 tunnel to the old I-UPF immediately after switching the path to new I-UPF. If indicated by the new I-SMF in step 6, the new I-UPF reports to SMF when \"end marker\" has been received. The new SMF initiates N4 Session Modification procedure to indicate the new I-UPF to send the DL packet(s) received from the UPF (PSA).\n8c.\tThe SMF responds to the new I-SMF with Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Response (the DNAI(s) of interest for this PDU Session in the case of I-SMF change) or Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Response (the DNAI(s) of interest for this PDU Session, Tunnel Info at UPF(PSA) for UL data in the case of I-SMF insertion if it is allocated in step 8b).\nIn the case of I-SMF insertion and the PDU session corresponds to a LADN, the SMF shall release the PDU session after the service request procedure is completed.\nIn the case of I-SMF insertion the SMF starts a timer to release resource, i.e. resource for the indirect data forwarding tunnel.\nIn the case of I-SMF insertion and the CN Tunnel Info at PSA for N9 is received in the response, I-SMF provides the CN Tunnel Info at the PSA for N9 to I-UPF via N4 Session Modification Request.\n9.\tThe new I-SMF sends a Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Response (N2 SM information (PDU Session ID, QFI(s), QoS profile(s), CN N3 Tunnel Info, S-NSSAI, User Plane Security Enforcement, UE Integrity Protection Maximum Data Rate), N1 SM Container, Cause)) to the AMF. The CN N3 Tunnel Info is the UL Tunnel Info of the new I-UPF.\nIf the PDU Session has been assigned any EPS bearer ID, the new I-SMF also includes the mapping between EPS bearer ID(s) and QFI(s) into the N2 SM information to be sent to the NG-RAN.\nThe new I-SMF starts a timer to release resource, i.e. resource for the indirect data forwarding tunnel.\nCase: I-SMF removal: steps 10 to 16 are skipped for I-SMF insertion or I-SMF change cases.\n10.\tIf the UE has moved from service area of old I-SMF into the service area of SMF, the AMF sends a Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request (SUPI, PDU Session ID, AMF ID, SM Context ID at I-SMF, UE location info, Access Type, RAT Type) to the SMF.\nIf the UE Time Zone has changed compared to the last reported UE Time Zone then the AMF shall include the UE Time Zone IE in this message.\nThe AMF Set the Operation Type to \"UP activate\" to indicate establishment of User Plane resources for the PDU Session(s). The AMF determines Access Type and RAT Type based, as defined in clause 4.2.3.2.\n11a.\tThe SMF retrieves SM Context from the I-SMF by invoking Nsmf_PDUSession_Context Request (SM context type). The SMF uses SM Context ID received from AMF for this service operation. SM context type indicates that the requested SM context is all, i.e. PDN Connection Context and 5G SM context.\n11b.\tThe old I-SMF responds with the SM context of the indicated PDU Session. If there is Extended Buffering is applied and the Extended Buffering timer is still running in old-SMF or old I-UPF, or the service request is triggered by downlink data (i.e. the old I-SMF received downlink data notification from old I-UPF), the old I-SMF includes a forwarding indication in the response to indicate that a forwarding tunnel is needed for sending buffered downlink packets from old I-UPF to new I-UPF or PSA (in the case that new I-UPF is not selected).\n12.\tThe SMF may select a new I-UPF: If the SMF determines that the service area of the PSA does not cover the UE location, the SMF selects a new I-UPF based on S-NSSAI and UE location information as described in clause 6.3.3 of TS 23.501 [2].\n13.\tIf a new I-UPF is selected by SMF, the SMF initiates a N4 Session Establishment to the new I-UPF. The new I-UPF provides tunnel endpoints to the SMF. If forwarding indication was received, the SMF requests the new I-UPF to allocate tunnel endpoints for forwarding data and to indicate end marker reception on this tunnel. In this case, the new I-UPF begins to buffer the downlink packet(s) received from the UPF (PSA).\nIf the new I-UPF is not selected, i.e. the PSA can serve the UE location, the SMF may initiate N4 Session Modification to the PSA to allocate UL N3 tunnel endpoints Info of PSA. The PSA provides the UL N3 tunnel endpoints to SMF. If the forwarding indication was received, the SMF requests the PSA to allocate the tunnel endpoints for the buffered DL data from the old I-UPF and indicate the PSA via usage reporting rule to report end marker to the SMF. In this case, the UPF (PSA) begins to buffer the DL data it may receive at the same time from the N6 interface. The UPF (PSA) sends one or more \"end marker\" packets according to the indication from SMF for each N9 tunnel to the old I-UPF immediately after switching the path to (R)AN. If indicated by the SMF, the UPF (PSA) reports to SMF when \"end marker\" packet is received. Then the SMF initiates N4 Session Modification procedure to indicate the UPF (PSA) to send the DL data received from the N6 interface.\n14a.\tIf the tunnel endpoints for the buffered DL data were allocated, the SMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request (tunnel endpoints for buffered DL data) to the old I-SMF in order to establish the forwarding tunnel. The SMF uses the SM Context ID received from AMF for this service operation.\n14b.\tThe old I-SMF initiates a N4 session modification to the old I-UPF and sends the tunnel endpoints for buffered DL data to the old I-UPF. After this step, the old I-UPF start to send buffered DL data to the new I-UPF or PSA if new I-UPF is not selected.\nIf the old I-UPF receives end marker packets and there is no associated tunnel to forward these packets, the old I-UPF discards the received end marker packets and does not send any Data Notification to SMF.\n14c.\tThe old I-SMF responds the SMF with Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext response.\n15.\tIf a new I-UPF was selected by SMF, the SMF initiates N4 Session Modification toward the PDU Session Anchor UPF, providing the new I-UPF DL tunnel information. The PSA begins to send the DL data to the new I-UPF as indicated in the new I-UPF DL tunnel information. If the forwarding indication was received, the SMF indicates the PDU Session Anchor UPF to send one or more \"end marker\" packets. The UPF (PSA) sends one or more \"end marker\" packets according to the indication from SMF for each N9 tunnel to the old I-UPF immediately after switching the path to new I-UPF. If indicated by the SMF in step 13, the new I-UPF reports to SMF when \"end marker\" packet is received. The SMF initiates N4 Session Modification procedure to indicate the new I-UPF to send the DL packet(s) received from the UPF (PSA).\n16.\tThe SMF sends a Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Response (N2 SM information (PDU Session ID, QFI(s), QoS profile(s), CN N3 Tunnel Info, S-NSSAI), N1 SM Container, Cause)) to the AMF. The CN N3 Tunnel Info is the UL Tunnel Info of the new I-UPF.\nIf the PDU Session has been assigned any EPS bearer ID, the SMF also includes the mapping between EPS bearer ID(s) and QFI(s) into the N2 SM information to be sent to the NG-RAN.\nThe SMF starts a timer to release the resource, i.e. resource for indirect data forwarding tunnel.\n17.\tThese steps are same as steps 12 to 14 in clause 4.2.3.2. After step 16, the Uplink data is transferred from (R)AN via new I-UPF (if exists) to PSA. If procedure in clause 4.2.3 is triggered together with this procedure, this step can be executed together with the corresponding steps in clause 4.2.3.\n17a. If the step 9 or step 16 was successful response, in the case of I-SMF removal or change, the AMF sends Nsmf_PDUSession_ReleaseSMContext Request (I-SMF only indication) to old I-SMF for the release of resources in old I-SMF. The I-SMF only indication indicates to old I-SMF not to invoke resource release in SMF.\nThe old I-SMF starts a timer to release resources, i.e. resource for indirect data forwarding tunnel.\n17b. The old I-SMF responds to AMF with Nsmf_PDUSession_ReleaseSMContext response.\nCase: I-SMF insertion or I-SMF change: steps 18 to 21 are skipped for the I-SMF removal case.\n18.\tThe AMF sends an Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request (N2 SM information, RAT type, Access type) to the new I-SMF.\nIf the AMF received N2 SM information (one or multiple) in step 17, then the AMF shall forward the N2 SM information to the relevant new I-SMF per PDU Session ID.\n19.\tThe new I-SMF updates the new I-UPF with the AN Tunnel Info and List of accepted QFI(s). Downlink data is now forwarded from new I-UPF to UE.\n20a.\tThe new I-SMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_Update request (RAT type, Access type, Operation Type) to SMF. The SMF updates associated access of the PDU Session.\nThe Operation Type is set to \"UP activated\" to indicate User Plane resource for the PDU Session has been established.\n20b.\tIf dynamic PCC is deployed, SMF may initiate notification about new location information to the PCF (if subscribed) by performing an SMF initiated SM Policy Modification procedure as defined in clause 4.16.5.1. The PCF may provide updated policies. If the PCC rule(s) are updated, the SMF may initiate a N4 Session Modification procedure to UPF (PSA) based on the updated PCC rule(s).\n20c.\tThe SMF responds with Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Response.\n21.\tThe new I-SMF sends a Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response to AMF.\nCase: I-SMF removal: steps 22 to 25 are skipped for the I-SMF insertion or I-SMF change cases.\n22.\tThe AMF sends a Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request (N2 SM information, RAT Type, Access Type) to the SMF. The AMF determines Access Type and RAT Type based on the Global RAN Node ID associated with the N2 interface.\nIf the AMF received N2 SM information (one or multiple) in step 17, then the AMF shall forward the N2 SM information to the relevant new I-SMF per PDU Session ID.\n23.\tIf dynamic PCC is deployed, SMF may initiate notification about new location information to the PCF by performing an SMF initiated SM Policy Modification procedure as defined in clause 4.16.5.1. The PCF may provide updated policies.\n24.\tIf a new I-UPF was selected by the SMF, the SMF updates the new I-UPF with the AN Tunnel Info and List of accepted QFI(s), otherwise, the SMF updates the PSA with the AN Tunnel Info and List of accepted QFI(s).\n25.\tThe SMF sends a Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response to AMF.\n26a.\tIn the case of I-SMF insertion or I-SMF change, upon timer set in step 9 expires and the indirect data forwarding tunnel was established before, the new I-SMF sends N4 Session Modification request to new I-UPF to release resources for the forwarding tunnel.\nIn the case of I-SMF removal, upon timer set in step 16 expires and the indirect data forwarding tunnel was established before, the SMF sends N4 Session Modification request to the new I-UPF or PSA to release the resource for the forwarding tunnel.\n26b.\tIn the case of I-SMF removal or change, upon timer set in step 17a expires and the indirect data forwarding tunnel was established before, the old I-SMF sends N4 Session Release request to the old I-UPF to release resources for the PDU Session. The old I-SMF releases the SM Context for the PDU Session. If the old I-UPF acts as UL CL and is not co-located with local PSA, the old I-SMF also sends N4 Session Release request to the local PSA to release resources for the PDU Session.\nIn the case of I-SMF insertion, upon timer set in step 8c expires and the indirect data forwarding tunnel was established before, the SMF sends N4 Session Release request to the old I-UPF to release the resource for the PDU Session.",

Then the SMF may decide a target DNAI finally.\nNOTE:\tIt is also possible that the SMF determines that there is no any target DNAI can be used based on PCC rule(s), e.g. when the updated PCC rules removes previously provided DNAI(s).\n2.\tThe SMF invokes a Nsmf_PDUSession_SMContextStatusNotify service operation (or Nsmf_PDUSession_StatusNotify) in the following cases:\n-\tif the SMF (or the associated old I-SMF) cannot serve the target DNAI, or\n-\tif an I-SMF is used for the PDU Session and the SMF decides that the DNAI currently served by I-SMF is no longer be used for the PDU Session anymore hence the existing I-SMF is not needed, or\n-\tif an I-SMF is used for the PDU Session and the SMF decides that the SMF itself can serve the target DNAI hence the existing I-SMF is not needed.\nThe content of the message includes the target DNAI information. The target DNAI information which indicates that the I-SMF selection or removal is expected and may include a target DNAI. This is to trigger the AMF to (re)select a suitable I-SMF, or remove the existing I-SMF (if the AMF decides that the SMF can serve the Target DNAI, or the AMF receive a target DNAI information without including target DNAI) for the PDU Session. The target DNAI is used for selecting (I-)SMF, which controls UPF connecting to that DNAI.\nIf there is an I-SMF serving the PDU session, the SMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_StatusNotify and then the I-SMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_SMContextStatusNotify message to send the target DNAI information for existing PDU session to AMF.\n3.\tIf the I-SMF selection or removal is expected, the AMF selects a new I-SMF which can serve the target DNAI or remove the existing I-SMF (if the AMF decides that the SMF can serve the Target DNAI, or if the AMF receives a target DNAI information without including target DNAI) for the existing PDU Session as described in clause 5.34.3 of TS 23.501 [2].\n4.\tThe AMF sends a Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request to the new I-SMF as described in step 3 of clause 4.23.4.3, or to the SMF as described in step 10 of clause 4.23.4.3, with the following enhancement:\nThe AMF includes target DNAI received from SMF in the message.

This list of DNAI(s) of interest for this PDU Session indicates to the I-SMF the list of DNAI(s) candidate for local traffic steering within the PDU Session.\nAn indication of whether Multi-homing is possible is also provided to the I-SMF and the I-SMF uses this information to decide whether multi-homing can be used for the PDU Session.\n3.\tWhenever the I-SMF has inserted or removed or changed a local offload capability the I-SMF invokes a Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request to indicate to the SMF the list of corresponding DNAI(s). Based on this indication the SMF invokes a Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request to send the corresponding N4 information to the I-SMF.\n4.\tThen SMF may then at any time invoke a Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request to send N4 information to the I-SMF.\n5.\tThe I-SMF may at any time send a Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request to forward to the SMF N4 events received from a local UPF; this may e.g. correspond to traffic reporting.\n6.\tWhen source I-SMF is to be removed from a PDU Session (e.g. at I-SMF change or removal), the SMF issues the N4 information targeting the UL CL/BP (s) and L-PSA(s) controlled by this I-SMF, including requests to release the corresponding N4 Sessions.\nIf the N9 forwarding tunnel to support the EAS session continuity controlled by I-SMF(s) is not established between the source ULCL and the target UL CL, when the Source I-SMF receives a Nsmf_PDUSession_ReleaseSMContext Request from AMF, it initiates a data forwarding timer (if indirect data forwarding applies) before releasing the resources of the PDU Session. When the Source I-SMF has received N4 release from SMF, it releases the UL CL/BP (s) and L-PSA(s) resources either directly if no data forwarding timer is started, or at the expiry of the data forwarding timer. Otherwise if the N9 forwarding tunnel to support the EAS session continuity controlled by I-SMF(s) is established between the source UL CL and target UL CL, the source I-SMF releases the UL CL/BP (s) and L-PSA(s) after no active traffic over the N9 forwarding tunnel.\nWhen IPv6 multi-homing is used and an I-SMF is removed, the SMF re-configure the UE to not use the original IP prefix @L-PSA(s).",

The I-SMF and an I-UPF controlled by I-SMF have already been inserted for the PDU Session. Events described in item 1 and 2 of clause 4.23.9.0 have taken place.\n2.\tAt some point, using the list of DNAI(s) of interest for this PDU Session received from the SMF, the I-SMF decides to establish a new PDU Session Anchor e.g. due to UE mobility. The I-SMF selects a UPF and using N4 establishes the new PDU Session Anchor 2 (PSA2) of the PDU Session. During this step:\n-\t(if needed) the PSA2 CN Tunnel Info of the local N9 termination on the PSA2 may be determined,\n-\tIn the case of IPv6 multi-homing applies to the PDU Session, a new IPv6 prefix corresponding to PSA2 is allocated by the I-SMF or by the UPF supporting the PSA2.\n3.\tThe I-SMF may select a UPF that will be acting as UL CL or Branching Point and replace the current I-UPF.\nIf a new UPF that will act as UL CL/Branching Point is selected (i.e. the existing I-UPF is replaced), the I-SMF uses N4 establishment to provide the 5G AN Tunnel Info, the PSA1 and (where applicable) PSA2 CN Tunnel Info to the new UPF.\nNOTE 1:\tIf the Branching Point or UL CL and the PSA2 are co-located in a single UPF then steps 2 and 3 can be merged.\n4.\tThe I-SMF invokes Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request (Indication of UL CL or Branching Point insertion, IPv6 prefix @PSA2, DNAI(s) supported by PSA2, DL Tunnel Info of the new UL CL/Branching Point, if any) to SMF. Separate N4 contents are exchanged over N16a for the local UL CL/BP(s) and for the local PSA(s) controlled by the I-SMF Multiple local PSAs (i.e. PSA2) may be inserted at one time, each corresponds to a DNAI and/or an IPv6 prefix in the case of multi-homing.\nThe I-SMF informs the SMF that a UL CL or Branching Point is inserted, the I-SMF provides DNAI(s) supported by PSA2 to the SMF. The DL Tunnel Info of UL CL/Branching Point is provided to SMF if a new UPF is selected to replace I-UPF in step 3.\nIn the case of IPv6 multi-homing PDU Session, the IPv6 prefix @PSA2 is also provided to SMF.\nThe SMF performs the Session Management Policy Modification procedure as defined in clause 4.16.5 to provide the new allocated IPv6 prefix to the PCF. The SMF may also send a notification to the AF, as described in clause 4.3.6.3.\nThe DNAI(s) supported by PSA2 may be used by the SMF to determine which PCC rules are to be applied at UPF(s) controlled by the I-SMF. The SMF acknowledges the Nsmf_PDUSession_Update from the I‑SMF\n5.\tIf a new DL Tunnel Info of UL CL/ Branching Point has been provided in step 4, the SMF updates the PSA1 via N4 with the CN Tunnel Info for the downlink traffic.

The SMF may also update the forwarding rules in PSA1 if some traffic is to be moved to UPFs controlled by I-SMF.\n6.\tThe SMF provides I-SMF with N4 information for the PSA and for the UL CL with a SMF initiated Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Request (set of (N4 information, involved DNAI), Indication of no DNAI change, Indication of no local PSA change)). The SMF generates N4 information for local traffic handling based on PCC rules and CHF requests that will be enforced by UPFs controlled by I-SMF. The N4 information for local traffic handling corresponds to N4 rules (PDR, FAR, URR, QER, etc.) related with the support of a DNAI. This is described in clause 5.34.6 of TS 23.501 [2]. N4 information for local traffic handling may indicate information (as the 5G AN Tunnel Info) that the SMF does not know and that the I-SMF needs to determine itself to build actual rules sent to the UPF(s). If the rule is applied to the local PSA, the N4 information includes the associated DNAI.\nIf the \"Indication of application relocation possibility\" or \"UE IP address preservation indication\" attributes are included in the PCC rule, the SMF includes the corresponding Indication of no DNAI change and Indication no local PSA change respectively.\nIf the CN Tunnel Info at the PSA1 has changed, the SMF may also provide its new value.\nThe I-SMF uses N4 information for local traffic handling received from the SMF as well as 5G AN Tunnel Info received from the 5G AN via the AMF and local configuration to determine N4 rules to send to the UPF(s) it is controlling.\n7.\tThe I-SMF updates the PSA2 via N4 providing N4 rules determined in step 6. It also provides the Branching Point or UL CL CN Tunnel Info for down-link traffic if the PSA2 and the UL CL/Branching Point are supported by different UPF(s).\n8. The I-SMF updates the Branching Point or UL CL via N4 providing N4 rules determined in step 6.\nNOTE 2:\tIf the Branching Point or UL CL and the PSA2 are co-located in a single UPF then step 7 and step 8 can be merged.\n9.\tThe I-SMF Issues a Nsmf_PDUSession_Update Response to SMF that may include N4 information received from the local UPF(s).\n10.\tSteps 6-8 of clause 4.3.5.4 are performed.

If the UE is in CM-IDLE, the UE first establishes an RRC connection or sends the RRCEarlyDataRequest message and sends a NAS message as part of this.\nThe UE may also send NAS Release Assistance Information (NAS RAI) included in the NAS message.

The procedure continues in step 8ab when the UE becomes reachable.\nIf the UE is configured for extended idle mode DRX, the AMF determines the Estimated Maximum Wait time based on the start of next PagingTime Window. The procedure continues in step 3 when the UE becomes reachable.\nIf the AMF detects that the UE context contains Paging Restriction Information, the AMF may block the paging for this UE based on the stored Paging Restriction Information (see clause 5.38.1 of TS 23.501 [2]). If the AMF blocks paging, the AMF sends MT_EnableUEReachability response to the SMF with an indication that its request has been rejected due to restricted paging.\n2e.\t[conditional] If the SMF receives an \"Estimated Maximum Wait time\" from the AMF and Extended buffering applies, the SMF sends a failure indication to the UPF with an Extended Buffering time and optionally a DL Buffering Suggested Packet Count. The Extended Buffering time is determined by the SMF and should be larger or equal to the Estimated Maximum Wait time received from the AMF. The DL Buffering Suggested Packet Count parameter is determined by the SMF and if available, the Suggested Number of Downlink Packets parameter may be considered. The procedure stops after this step.\n2f.\t[conditional] If buffering is not configured in the UPF, then the UPF forwards the downlink data to the (V‑)SMF in non-roaming and LBO cases. In the home-routed roaming case, the H-UPF forwards the data to the V-UPF and then to the V-SMF.\n2g.\t[conditional] The SMF determines whether Extended Buffering applies based on local policy and the capability of the SMF.\nIf user data is received in step 2f and Extended buffering is not configured for the SMF, then (V-)SMF compresses the header if header compression applies to the PDU session and creates the downlink user data PDU that is intended as payload in a NAS message. The (V-)SMF forwards the downlink user data PDU and the PDU session ID to the AMF using the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation. If Extended Buffering applies, then (V-)SMF keeps a copy of the downlink data.\nIf user data is received in step 2f and Extended Buffering applies, the SMF includes \"Extended Buffering support\" indication in Namf_Communication_N1N2Message Transfer.\n2h.\t[conditional] AMF responds to SMF.\nIf AMF determines that the UE is reachable for the SMF, then the AMF informs the SMF. Based on this, the SMF deletes the copy of the downlink data.\nIf the AMF determines the UE is unreachable for the SMF (e.g. if the UE is in MICO mode or the UE is configured for extended idle mode DRX), then the AMF rejects the request from the SMF.\nIf the SMF included Extended Buffering support indication, the AMF indicates the Estimated Maximum Wait time, in the reject message, for the SMF to determine the Extended Buffering time. Based on the rejection message from the AMF, the SMF should subscribe with the AMF for UE reachability using the Namf_EventExposure service.\nIf the UE is in MICO mode, the AMF determines the Estimated Maximum Wait time based on the next expected periodic registration timer update expiration or by implementation. The procedure continues in step 8ab when the UE becomes reachable.\nIf the UE is configured for extended idle mode DRX, the AMF determines the Estimated Maximum Wait time based on the start of next PagingTime Window. The procedure continues in step 3 when the UE becomes reachable.\nIf the AMF detects that the UE context contains Paging Restriction Information, the AMF may block the paging for this UE, based on the stored Paging Restriction Information (see clause 5.38.1 of TS 23.501 [2]). If the AMF blocks paging, the AMF sends Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer response to the SMF with an indication that its request has been rejected due to restricted paging.\nIf the SMF receives an \"Estimated Maximum Wait time\" from the AMF and Extended Buffering in SMF applies, the SMF store the DL Data for the Extended Buffering time. The Extended Buffering time is determined by the SMF and should be larger or equal to the Estimated Maximum Wait time received from the AMF. The SMF does not send any additional Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer message if subsequent downlink data packets are received.\n3.\t[Conditional] If the UE is in CM-IDLE, when the AMF determines that the UE is reachable, the AMF sends a paging message to NG-RAN. If available, the AMF may include the WUS Assistance Information in the N2 Paging message(s).\n4.\t[Conditional] If NG-RAN received a paging message from AMF and UE and NG-RAN support WUS, then:\n-\tif the NGAP Paging message contains the Assistance Data for Recommended Cells IE (see TS 38.413 [10]), then NG-RAN shall only broadcast the UE's Wake Up Signal in the last used cell;\n-\telse (i.e. the Assistance Data for Recommended Cells IE is not included in the NGAP Paging message) NG-RAN should not broadcast the UE's Wake Up Signal.\nNG-RAN performs paging. If the WUS Assistance Information is included in the N2 Paging message, the NG-eNB takes it into account when paging the UE (see TS 36.300 [46]).\n5.\t[Conditional] If the UE receives paging message, it responds with a NAS message sent over RRC Connection Establishment.\nIf the UE is in CM-IDLE state in 3GPP access and is using the Multi-USIM Paging Rejection feature (see clause 5.38 of TS 23.501 [2]), upon reception of paging request and if the UE determines not to accept the paging, the UE attempts to send a Reject Paging Indication via the UE Triggered Service Request procedure (clause 4.2.3.2) unless it is unable to do so, e.g. due to UE implementation constraints.\n5a.\t[Conditional] In the NB-IoT case, during Step 5, the NG-RAN, based on configuration, may retrieve the NB-IoT UE Priority and the Expected UE Behaviour Parameters from the AMF, if not previously retrieved. Based on such parameters, the NG-RAN may apply prioritisation between requests from different UEs before triggering step 6 and throughout the RRC connection. The NG-RAN may retrieve additional parameters (e.g. UE Radio Capabilities).\n6.\t[Conditional] The NAS message is forwarded to the AMF. If the AMF receives any Paging Restrictions information in the Control Plane Service Request, the AMF updates the UE context with the received Paging Restrictions information. If no Paging Restriction information is provided, no paging restrictions apply.\n7a.\t[Conditional] AMF to SMF: Namf_MT-EnableUEReachability Response.\nIf the SMF used the MT_EnableUEReachability request in step 2c and the UE has not responded to paging then the AMF sends a response to the SMF indicating that the request failed.\nIf the SMF used the MT_EnableUEReachability service operation in step 2c and the UE has responded with a Control Plane Service Request NAS message including Reject Paging Indication in step 5, the AMF notifies the SMF using the MT_EnableUEReachability response that the UE rejected the page and no user plane connection will be established. The UE remains reachable for future paging attempts.\n7b.\t[Conditional] SMF to UPF: If the SMF has received a Namf_MT-EnableUEReachability response from the AMF indicating that the request failed or the UE rejected the paging, the SMF indicates to the UPF to discard the buffered data. . If the AMF indicated that the UE rejected the paging, steps 7c-12 are skipped. Otherwise the procedure stops after this step.\n7c.\t[Conditional] AMF to SMF: Namf_Communication_N1N2Transfer Failure Notification.\nIf the SMF used the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation in step 2g and the UE has not responded to paging, the AMF sends a failure notification to the SMF based on which the SMF discards the buffered data. The procedure stops after this step.\nIf the SMF used the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation in step 2g and the UE has responded with a Control Plane Service Request NAS message including Reject Paging Indication in step 5, the AMF notifies the SMF using the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer Failure Notification that the UE rejected the page and no user plane connection will be established. The UE remains reachable for future paging attempts. Steps 9-12 are skipped.\n8aa.\t[Conditional] AMF to SMF: Namf_MT-EnableUEReachability Response.\nIf the SMF used the MT_EnableUEReachability request in step 2c and steps 2d-2e were skipped, then the AMF indicates to the SMF that the UE is reachable.\n8ab.\t[Conditional] AMF to SMF: If in step 2d or 2h the SMF has subscribed with the AMF for UE reachability event, the AMF uses the Namf_EventExposure Notify service operation indicating to the SMF that the UE is reachable.\n8b.\t[Conditional] SMF to UPF: N4 Session Modification Request.\nIf the SMF received an indication from the AMF that the UE is reachable, then the SMF indicates to the UPF to deliver buffered data to the SMF.\n8c.\t[Conditional] UPF to SMF: N4 Session Modification Response.\n8d.\t[Conditional] Buffered data is delivered to the SMF.\n8e.\t[Conditional] (V-)SMF compresses the header if header compression applies to the PDU session and creates the downlink user data PDU that is intended as payload in a NAS message. The (V-)SMF forwards the downlink user data PDU and the PDU session ID to the AMF using the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation.\nWhen buffering is not configured in the UPF, this step is executed only if in step 2h the SMF has subscribed with the AMF for UE reachability event.\n9.\tThe AMF creates a DL NAS transport message with the PDU session ID and the downlink user data PDU received from the SMF. The AMF ciphers and integrity protects the NAS transport message.\n10.\tThe AMF sends the DL NAS transport message to NG-RAN.\n11.\tNG-RAN delivers the NAS payload over RRC to the UE.\n12.\tWhile the RRC connection is established further uplink and downlink data can be exchanged. In order to send uplink data, the procedure continues as per steps 1-10 of the UPF anchored Mobile Originated Data Transport in Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation procedure (clause 4.24.1).\n13.\tIf the AMF has paged the UE to trigger the NAS procedure as in step 3-6, the AMF shall initiate the UE configuration update procedure as defined in clause 4.2.4.2 to assign a new 5G-GUTI. If the UE response in the Control Plane Service Request NAS message includes a Reject Paging Indication, the AMF triggers the release of the UE as specified in clause 4.2.3.2.\n14.\t[Conditional] If no further activity is detected by NG-RAN, then NG-RAN triggers the AN release procedure.\n15.\t[Conditional] The UE's logical NG-AP signalling connection and RRC signalling connection are released according to clause 4.2.6.\nNOTE:\tThe details of the NGAP messages to be used for this procedure are specified in TS 38.413 [10].",

TLTRI is included in the request if the Requested Action is set to \"Update\" or \"Cancel\", otherwise TLTRI is not included in the request and the NEF assigns a TLTRI to the NIDD Configuration. If Reliable Data Service Configuration is present, the Reliable Data Service Configuration may include the mobile terminated and mobile originated serialization format(s) that are supported by the AF for each port number.\nNOTE 1:\tIt is up to the AF to determine whether and if NIDD Duration can be set to never expire.\nNOTE 2:\tThe AF is expected to be configured to use the same NEF as the one selected by the SMF during the UE's establishment of the PDU Session used for NEF based NIDD.\nNOTE 3:\tWhen more than one AF is associated with a PDU Session, the parameters that are provided in step 2 can be provisioned in the NEF based on operator policy or configuration. In which case, any parameters that are provided in step 2 that conflict with the provisioned values are ignored.\nNOTE 4:\tIf the AF does not indicate a serialization format, it is assumed that the UE application is provisioned to know what serialization format will be used for MT traffic or that the AF will use the same format that is used by the associated MO traffic.\n3.\tIf the Requested Action is set to \"Cancel\" it indicates that the purpose of the request is to cancel the transaction identified by TLTRI and the flow proceeds to step 7. If the Requested Action is set to \"Update\", the purpose of the transaction is to update the parameters associated with the configuration (i.e. Reliable Data Service). Otherwise, the request is for a new NIDD configuration and the NEF stores the received GPSI or External Group Identifier, AF Identifier, T8 Destination Address and NIDD Duration. If either the AF is not authorised to perform this request (e.g. based on policies, if the SLA does not allow for it) or the Nnef_NIDDConfiguration_Create Request is malformed, the NEF performs step 7 and provides a Cause value appropriately indicating the error. Depending on the configuration, the NEF may change the NIDD Duration.\n4.\tThe NEF sends an Nudm_NIDDAuthorisation_Get Request (GPSI or External Group Identifier, S-NSSAI, DNN, AF Identifier, MTC Provider Information, NIDD Duration, Update Notification Address) message to the UDM to authorise the NIDD configuration request for the received External Group Identifier or GPSI.\nNOTE 5:\tThe NEF uses the AF Identifier, External Group Identifier or GPSI that was obtained in step 2 to determine what DNN will be used to enable transfer of unstructured data between the UE and the AF. This determination is based on local policies.\nNOTE 6:\tThe MTC Provider Information in step 2 is an optional parameter. The NEF should validate the provided MTC Provider Information and may override it to a NEF selected MTC Provider Information based on configuration. How the NEF determines the MTC Provider Information, if not present in step 2, is left to implementation (e.g. based on the requesting AF).\n5.\tThe UDM examines the Nudm_NIDDAuthorisation_Get Request message.\nIf the authorisation is successful and if an External Group Identifier was included in step 4, the UDM maps the External Group Identifier to an Internal-Group Identifier and a list of GPSIs and maps GPSIs to SUPIs.\nNOTE 7:\tIf External Group Identifier was included in step 4, how the UDM selects a GPSI when multiple GPSIs are associated with the same SUPI is left to implementation, e.g. based on the MTC Provider Information (if received) or the default GPSI (if not received).\n6.\tThe UDM sends an Nudm_NIDDAuthorisation_Get Response (single value or list of (SUPI and GPSI), Result) message to the NEF to acknowledge acceptance of the Nudm_NIDDAuthorisation_Get Request. If the UDM determines that the list size exceeds the message capacity, the UDM shall segment the list and send it in multiple messages (for details on segmentation, see TS 29.503 [52]). The SUPI(s) and if available, the GPSI(s) (when Nnef_NIDDConfiguration_Create Request contains an GPSI) are returned by the UDM in this response. This allows the NEF to correlate the AF request received in step 2 of this procedure with the SMF-NEF Connection to be established for each UE or each group member UE. Depending on the configuration (e.g. based on DNN), the UDM may change the NIDD Duration and include the updated value of the NIDD Duration in the response to the NEF.\n7.\tThe NEF sends a Nnef_NIDDConfiguration_Create Response (TLTRI, Maximum Packet Size, Reliable Data Service Indication and Cause) message to the AF to acknowledge acceptance of the Nnef_NIDDConfiguration_Create Request. If the NIDD Configuration was accepted, the NEF assigns a TLTRI to the NIDD Configuration and sends it to the AF. The NEF creates an association between the TLTRI, GPSI or External Group Identifier, SUPI and PDU session ID which is received from the SMF in step 2 of the SMF-NEF Connection procedure in clause 4.25.1. In the MT NIDD procedure, the NEF will use TLTRI and either GPSI or External Group Identifier to determine the SUPI(s) and PDU session ID(s) of PDU Session(s) for delivering unstructured data. In the MO NIDD procedure, the NEF will use the SUPI(s) and PDU session ID(s) to obtain the TLTRI, GPSI.

The AMF sends the 5G access stratum time distribution indication (enable, disable), the Uu time synchronization error budget, clock quality detail level and clock quality acceptance criteria when they are available, to NG-RAN during mobility registration, AM policy modification, Service Request, N2 Handover and Xn handover as specified in TS 38.413 [10]. The NG-RAN node shall, if supported, store the information in the UE Context. Based on this information, the NG-RAN node provides the 5GS access stratum time to the UE according to the Uu time synchronization error budget as provided by the TSCTSF (if supported by UE and NG-RAN) and NG-RAN provides timing synchronization status reports to the UE (as described in clause 4.15.9.5.2).",

N2 SM information and N2 NRPPa information are mutually exclusive.\nOutput, Required: Result indication.\nOutput, Optional: Redirection information, Estimated Maximum wait time.\nIf the UE is in CM-IDLE state, the AMF initiates the network triggered Service Request procedure as specified in clause 4.2.3.3 and responds to the consumer NF with a result indication, \"attempting to reach UE\".

A result indication of \"N1/N2 transfer success\" does not mean that N1 message is successfully received by the UE. It only means that the AMF is able to successfully send the N1 or N2 message towards the AN.\nThe \"Area of validity for the N2 SM information\", if included is used by the AMF to determine whether the N2 SM information provided by the consumer NF can be used towards the AN based on the current location of the UE. If the location of the UE is outside the \"Area of validity for the N2 SM information\" indicated, the AMF shall not send the N2 SM information to the AN.\nIf the consumer NF knows that a specific downlink N1 message is the last message to be transferred in this transaction, the consumer NF shall include the last message indication in the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation so that the AMF knows that the no more downlink N1 message need to be transferred for this transaction.\nThe CN NF is implicitly subscribed to be notified of N1N2TransferFailure by providing the N1N2TransferFailure Notification Target Address. When AMF detects that the UE fails to respond to paging, or the UE responds to paging with a Reject Paging Indication, or the AMF determines the UE is temporarily unreachable e.g. due to extended idle mode DRX or MICO mode, the AMF invokes the Namf_Communication_N1N2TransferFailureNotification to provide the failure notification to the location addressed by N1N2TransferFailure Notification Target Address.\nThe \"Extended Buffering applies\" indication, if included, is used by the AMF to include \"Estimated Maximum Wait time\" in Namf_Communication_N1N2 TransferFailureNotification if invoked due to the UE being unreachable.\nIf the result of the service operation fails, the AMF shall set the corresponding cause value in the result indication which can be used by the NF consumer for further action. If the related UE is not served by AMF and the AMF knows which AMF is serving the UE, the AMF provides redirection information which can be used by the consumer NF to resend UE related message to the AMF that serves the UE.\nIf the consumer NF is a SMF and he request includes N2 SM information, the SMF indicates the type of N2 SM information.

The Total number of transactions is incremented when the NAS signalling transactions from Authentication, Registration, De-Registration, Service Request and UE Configuration Update procedures is completed. Only the periodic reporting mode applies.\nIn addition to UE access and mobility information event, AMF exposes the \"S-NSSAIs per TAI mapping\" event providing, per TAI, the related access type and list of supported S-NSSAIs (including indication of S-NSSAIs restricted by AMF). The Event Consumer may use as target of event reporting a list of TAIs, or \"any TAI\" and may use event filter information including a list of \"S-NSSAIs\". Whenever there is a change in supported S-NSSAIs (including indication of S-NSSAIs restricted by AMF) for a TAI, the event notification is generated with the updated information.\nEvent Filters are used to specify the conditions to match for notifying the event (i.e. \"List of Parameter values to match\"). If there are no conditions to match for a specific Event ID, then the Event Filter is not provided. The following table provides some examples on how the conditions to match for event reporting can be specified for various Event IDs for AMF exposure.\nNOTE:\tThe conditions to match can be set based on AMF-associated expected UE Behaviour parameter(s) to only notify the event when the UE's behaviour deviates from its expected UE behaviour as described in TS 23.288 [50].\nTable 5.2.2.3.1-1: Example of Event Filters for AMF exposure events\nEvent ID\nEvent Filter (List of Parameter Values to Match)\nLocation Report\n<Parameter Type = LocationFilter, Value = TA1>\nUE moving in or out of Area of Interest\n<Parameter Type = TAI, Value = TA1>\n<Parameter Type = S-NSSAI, Value = S-NSSAI1>\n<Parameter Type = NSI ID, Value = NSI ID1>\n<Parameter Type = PRA ID, Value = PRA ID value>\n<Parameter Type = RAN Node ID, Value = RAN Node ID value>\n<Parameter Type = Cell ID, Value = Cell ID value>\n<Parameter Type = RAN timing synchronization status change event >\n(NOTE 1) (NOTE 2)\n<Parameter Type = Adjust AoI based on RA, Value = Yes or No> to indicate that AMF may adjust the received AoI depending on UE's current Registration Area.

      "content": "Service description: This service operates on the PDU Sessions. The following are the key functionalities of this NF service:\n-\t(between AMF and SMF) Creation / Deletion / Modification of AMF-SMF interactions for PDU Sessions;\nThe resource handled between AMF and SMF via Create / Update / Release SM context operations corresponds to the AMF-SMF association for a PDU Session;\nWhen the AMF has got no association with an SMF to support a PDU Session, the AMF creates such association via the Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext operation. The context created is identified via the SM Context ID. Otherwise (e.g. at hand-over between 3GPP and Non 3GPP access) the AMF uses the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext operation.\nNOTE 1:\tIn TS 29.502 [36] SM Context ID is referred to as smContextRef for N11 and pduSessionRef and pduSessionUri for N16.\nWhen the UE is handed-over from an (old) AMF towards another (new) AMF, the old AMF provides the new AMF with the SMF addressing information corresponding to the AMF-SMF association related with each PDU Session of that UE. The new AMF can thus further act upon the association with the SMF via Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext and Nsmf_PDUSession_ReleaseSMContext operations. This may take place:\n-\tat inter AMF change due to AMF planned maintenance or due to AMF failure described in clause 5.21.2 of TS 23.501 [2];\n-\tat inter AMF mobility in CM-CONNECTED state described in clause 4.9.1.3;\n-\tat inter AMF mobility in CM-IDLE state described in clause 4.2.2.2.\n-\t(between AMF and SMF) Passing MO Small Data from AMF to SMF in clause 4.24.1.\n-\t(between V-SMF and H-SMF) Creation / Deletion / Modification of PDU Sessions;\n-\t(between V-SMF/I-SMF and (H-)SMF) Transferring MO Small Data from V-SMF/I-SMF to (H-)SMF in clause 4.25.4.\n-\t(between V-SMF/I-SMF and (H-)SMF) Transferring MT Small Data from (H-)SMF to V-SMF/I-SMF in clause 4.24.5.\nEven though the V-SMF creates the PDU Session resource onto the H-SMF, each of the V-SMF and of the H-SMF needs to be able to modify a PDU Session and/or to ask for PDU Session Release. Thus, at Nsmf_PDUSession_Create, V-SMF informs the H-SMF about addressing information for its corresponding PDU Session resource, allowing H-SMF to use later on the Nsmf_PDUSession_Update and Nsmf_PDUSession_Release and Nsmf_PDUSession_StatusNotify operations.\nNOTE 2:\tThe PDU Session resource in V-SMF is created when the AMF requests to create SM context of this PDU Session\nNOTE 3:\tH-SMF also informs the consumer (V-SMF) about addressing information about its PDU Session resource, but this is part of normal resource creation operation in REST and not specific to this service.",

It is included by NF consumer to indicate applicable NSAC admission mode in VPLMN. Its values can be VPLMN NSAC admission mode, or VPLMN with HPLMN assistance NSAC admission mode.\nThe PLMN ID is the serving PLMN of the UE.\nThe UE already registered parameter indicates that the UE has already been registered in another NSACF service area.\nThe AMF NSAC service area is included in a centralized NSAC architecture, if available.\nThe NSACF may optionally return the current status of the network slice availability (e.g. a percentage out of the maximum number of UEs registered with a network slice) in the availability status parameter. This information may be used for NSACF signalling and load balancing in case multiple NSACFs are serving the same network slice.\nOutputs, Required: Result indication.\nThe Result indication parameter contains the outcome of the update and check operation in the NSACF and may indicate one of the values 'maximum number of UEs for the S-NSSAI not reached' or 'maximum number of UEs for the S-NSSAI reached'.\nOutputs, Optional: Updated local maximum number of registered UEs, or Updated UE admission threshold.\nThese parameters can only be returned by a primary NSACF.",

There are several operations for this service:\n-\tNotifying events on the PDU Session to the NFs.\n-\tAllow consumer NFs to subscribe and unsubscribe for an Event ID on UPF.\nThe following events can be notified to a NF consumer:\n-\tQoS Monitoring. This event provides QoS Flow level performance information and can be used for direct event notification of QoS Monitoring reports to a different NF than the SMF as defined in clause 5.8.2.18 of TS 23.501 [2], or it may be for UPF Data collection by NWDAF for analytics (see TS 23.288 [50]) as described in clause 4.15.4.5.\nSubscription to this event is always indirect via SMF. The subscription specifies the type of measurement that is being requested. A combination of the information listed below can be requested.\nUPF and SMF interact using Session Reporting Rules as defined in clause 5.8.5.11 of TS 23.501 [2].\nThe event notification may contain following information:\n-\tQoS monitoring result for the QoS monitoring parameter(s) defined in clause 5.45 of TS 23.501 [2], e.g. UL packet delay, DL packet delay, or round trip packet delay.\n-\tIndication of QoS Flow associated with the default QoS Rule (if requested by SMF, see clause 4.15.4.5.1).\n-\tUser Data Usage Measures or User Data Usage Trends. These events provide information about traffic matching Event Filter Information (see below) for a user's PDU Session or for each PDU Session served by the UPF. It can be used for UPF Data Collection by NWDAF for analytics (see TS 23.288 [50]) as described in clause 4.15.4.5.\nSMF shall use Service Based Interface subscription service operation to subscribe this UPF event. Other direct consumers can subscribe directly to UPF under the conditions defined in clause 5.8.2.17 of TS 23.501 [2]. The subscription request contains the Type of Measurement that is being requested, the Target of Event Reporting and the Event Filter Information (which describes the target traffic) and the required Granularity of Measurement. The Target of Event Reporting can be either a specific PDU Session or \"any UE\". The Event Filter Information may contain one or more of the following parameters: DNN, S-NSSAI, either Application ID(s) or Traffic Filtering Information. The Granularity of Measurement can indicate per data flow, per application, or per PDU Session. A combination of the information listed below for User Data Usage Measures can be requested.\nFor User Data Usage Measures, the event notification may contain following event related information:\n-\tVolume Measurement: measurements of data volume exchanged (UL, DL and/or overall) and/or number of packets exchanged (UL, DL and/or overall) determined for the requested Granularity of Measurement.\n-\tThroughput Measurement: measurements of data throughput (UL and DL) determined for the requested Granularity of Measurement.\n-\tApplication related Information: URL(s) and/or Domain information (domain name and protocol) detected for the target traffic. This Type of Measurement requires that Application Id(s) or Traffic Filtering Information is provided (i.e. this measurement is not possible to be applied for all traffic handled by the UPF).\nFor User Data Usage Trends, the event notification may contain following event related information:\n-\tThroughput Statistic Measurement (average and/or peak throughput) over the measurement period determined for the requested Granularity of Measurement.\nFor User Data Usage Measures and User Data Usage Trends, if the subscription is targeting any UE, the UPF shall perform the requested measurements for every PDU Session that matches the Event Filter Information and send the information per PDU Session, including the DNN and S-NSSAI and optionally, the sampling ratio achieved by the UPF. When the subscription requests that information is provided per data flow, the notification includes the Packet Filter Set and the Applications Identifier, if available.\nNOTE 1:\tIf the Target of Event Reporting is \"any UE\", care needs to be taken with regards to load and major signalling impacts and it is expected that the subscription request contains Event Filter Information and appropriate Event Reporting Information (like Sampling ratio and Partitioning criteria, see Table 4.15.1-1) in order to minimize the UPF performance impact of the per PDU Session measurement.\nNOTE 2:\tThe UPF can combine information for different PDU Sessions into one notification message (see TS 29.564 [93]).\n-\tTSC management information (UMIC, PMIC, NW-TT port number) as defined in clause 5.8.5.14 of TS 23.501 [2].\nTSC management information event can be the result of an implicit subscription of the PCF on behalf of the TSNAF/TSCTSF via the Npcf_SMPolicyControl service as described in clause 5.28 of TS 23.501 [2].\nIf the consumer of UPF service is NWDAF and the target of UE is any UE, according to the Analytic ID from consumer, the NWDAF can decide which kind of information should be collect from UPF and event ID to use. Subscription may be performed directly towards UPF or via SMF as described in clause 5.8.2.17 of TS 23.501 [2]. The UPF collects the data according to the event ID and exposes the related information directly regardless of whether the subscription has been relayed by the SMF.",

      "content": "Annex A (informative):Drafting rules and conventions for NF services\nA.1\tGeneral\nThis informative Annex provides drafting rules and conventions followed in this technical specification (and TS 23.501 [2]) for the definition of NF services offered over the service-based interfaces.\nA.2\tNaming\nA.2.1\tService naming\nEach NF service provided by a service-based interface shall be named and referred to according to the following nomenclature:\n-\tNnfname_ServiceName, where Nnfname is the service-based interface where the NF service is invoked. See clause 4.2.5 of TS 23.501 [2] for the list of service-based interfaces in the 5GS Architecture.\nExample (illustrative): Namf_Registration.\nA.2.2\tService operation naming\nIf a service contains multiple independent operations, each operation shall be named and referred to according to the following nomenclature:\n-\tNnfname_ServiceName_ServiceOperation[Method], where the ServiceName represents the actual NF service. The ServiceOperation itself defines the available service functionality which can be addressed by a specific operation. The Method(s) is/are the action(s), how the ServiceOperation can be used. It can be created, read, updated or deleted.\nExample (illustrative): Namf_Session_Registration[Create], Namf_Session_Registration[Delete]\nIn general, this operation naming structure for the given example is depicted in a tree-structure diagram:\nFigure A.2.2-1: Service Operation Naming and its Methods\nA.3\tRepresentation in an information flow\nInvoking a service or service operation within an information flow is represented using a disaggregated representation (see figure A.3-1).\nThe disaggregated representations on figure A.3-1 shall be used as follows:\n-\tThe <step> represents the actual step number in the information flow e.g. ″7.″.\n-\tRepresentation a) shall be used when the step is required.\n-\tRepresentation b) shall be used when the step is optional or conditional.\nFigure A.3-1: Disaggregated representation of a NF service or service operation in information flows\nNOTE:\tDepending on the information flow, the order of NF Producer and NF Consumer can be reversed.\nA.4\tReference to services and service operations in procedures\nWhenever a procedure needs to refer to the service or service operation of a service-based interface, the naming in clause A.2 shall be used, using italic font. Unless otherwise obvious in the text, the NF Consumer of the service or service operation shall be indicated within parenthesis after the service or service operation name.\n-\t<Nnfname_ServiceName<_OperationName>> (<NF Name Consumer>)\nExample: e.g. Namf_Registration_RelocationRequest (AMF)\nA.5\tService and service operation description template\nThe description of a service or service operation in this specification shall be done according to the following template.\nNOTE:\tThe heading level should follow that of the actual clause where the service is specified.\nX.x\t<Nnfname_ServiceName<_OperationName>>\nX.x.1\tDescription\nService or service operation name: <Nnfname_ServiceName<_OperationName>>.\nDescription: <short descriptive text>.\nKnown NF Consumers: <list of NFs>.\nInputs, Required: <list of parameters> -- Parameters required from NF Consumer for successful completion of the service or service operation. Parameters required for the operation of the underlying protocol shall not be listed.\nInputs, Optional: <list of parameters> -- Additional parameters that may be provided by NF Consumer for execution of the service or service operation. Parameters required for the operation of the underlying protocol shall not be listed.\nOutputs, Required: <list of parameters>, < Nnfname_ServiceNameX<_OperationNameY >>, <Other> -- Parameters provided to NF Consumer and/or service triggered upon successful completion of the service and/or other (e.g. procedure triggered). Parameters required for the operation of the underlying protocol shall not be listed.\nOutputs, Optional: <list of parameters> -- Additional parameters provided to NF Consumer upon successful completion of the service or service operation. Parameters required for the operation of the underlying protocol shall not be listed.\nX.x.2\tService/service operation information flow\n<Information flow of the service or service operation offered by NF Producer to NF Consumer over the NF Producer service-based interface>.\nNOTE:\tThis information flow can require invoking other services. In this case, the invoked services are represented as described in clause A.3.\nA.6\tDesign Guidelines for NF services\nClause 7.1.1 of TS 23.501 [2] defines the criteria for defining the NF services. The following clauses identify the design guidelines that shall be considered for identifying the NF services.\nA.6.1\tSelf-Containment\nThe following design guidelines are used for identifying self-contained NF services.\n-\tEach NF service operates on its own set of context(s). A context refers to a state or a software resource or an internal data storage. The NF service operations can create, read, update or delete the context(s).\n-\tAny direct access of a context(s) owned by a NF service is be made by the service operations of that NF service. Services provided by the same NF can communicate internally within the NF.\nA.6.2\tReusability\nThe following design guidelines are used for specifying NF services to be reusable.\n-\tNF service operations are specified such that other NF can potentially invoke them in future, if required.\n-\tThe service operations may be usable in multiple system procedures specified in clause 4 of this specification.\n-\tUsing clause 4 of the current document, the system procedures in which the NF service operations can be used are considered and based on that the parameters for the NF service operations are clearly listed.\nNOTE:\tIt is possible that, when mapping an end to end call flow to service based architecture, one step in the call flow may map to multiple NF service operation invocations. This specification clearly identifies each NF service operation invocation in the call flow. Protocol optimization of multiple NF service operation invocations are left for TS 29.500 [17] consideration.\nA.6.3\tUse Independent Management Schemes\nThe mechanisms for independent management schemes are not in scope of this specification.\nAnnex B (informative):Drafting Rules for Information flows\nThe following drafting rules are recommended for information flows specified in this specification in order to ensure that the Control Plane network functions can be supported with service based interfaces:\n1.\tInformation flows should describe the end to end functionality. NF services in clause 5 shall only be derived from the information flows in clause 4.\n2.\tInformation flows should strive to use type of interactions such as REQUEST/RESPONSE (e.g. location request, location response), SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY between Core CP NFs. Any other type of interactions described should have justifications for its use.\n3.\tInformation flows should also ensure readability thus the semantics of the REQUEST/RESPONSE should still be maintained (for instance, we need to indicate PDU Session request, PDU Session response and Subscribe for UE location reporting/Notify UE location reporting) for readers and developers to understand the need for a certain transaction.\nNOTE:\tAs stated in TS 23.501 [2], service based interface is not supported for N1, N2, N4. Thus, the rules are not meant for those interfaces.\nAnnex C (informative):Generating EPS PDN Connection parameters from 5G PDU Session parameters\nThis annex specifies how to generate the EPS PDN connection parameters from the 5G PDU Session parameters in SMF+PGW-C.\nWhen the SMF+PGW-C is requested to set up/modify either a PDN connection or a PDU session supporting interworking between EPS and 5GS, the SMF+PGW-C generates the PDN Connection parameters from the PDU session parameters.\nWhen the SMF+PGW-C generates the PDN Connection parameters based on the PDU Session parameters, the following rules hold:\n-\tPDN type: the PDN type is set to IPv4, IPv6 or IPv4v6 if the PDU Session Type is IPv4, IPv6 or IPv4v6, respectively. The PDN Type is set to Ethernet if the MME, SGW and UE support Ethernet PDN Type, otherwise the PDN type is set to Non-IP for Ethernet and Unstructured PDU Session Types\n-\tEPS bearer ID: the EBI is requested from the AMF during the establishment of a QoS Flow as described in clause 4.11.1.4.1 for PDU Sessions supporting interworking between EPS and 5GS. The EBI is obtained from MME during the establishment of an EPS Bearer (that is triggered by an establishment of a QoS Flow) as defined in TS 23.401 [13] for PDN Connections hosted by SMF+PGW-C. The association between EBI and QoS Flow is stored by the SMF.\n-\tAPN-AMBR: APN-AMBR is set according to operator policy (e.g. taking the Session AMBR into account).\n-\tEPS QoS parameters (including ARP, QCI, GBR and MBR):\nIf QoS Flow is mapped to one EPS bearer, ARP, GBR and MBR of the EPS Bearer is set to the ARP, GFBR and MFBR of the corresponding QoS Flow, respectively. For standardized 5QIs, the QCI is one to one mapped to the 5QI. For non-standardized 5QIs, the SMF+PGW-C derives the QCI based on the 5QI and operator policy.\nA GBR QoS Flow is mapped 1 to 1 to a GBR dedicated EPS Bearer if an EBI has been assigned. After mobility to EPS traffic flows corresponding to GBR QoS Flow for which no EBI has been assigned will continue flowing on the default EPS bearer if it does not have assigned TFT.\nIf multiple QoS Flows are mapped to one EPS bearer, the EPS bearer parameters are set based on operator policy, e.g. EPS bearer QoS parameters are set according to the highest QoS of all mapped QoS Flows.\nAfter mobility to EPS traffic flows corresponding to Non-GBR QoS Flows for which no EBI has been assigned will continue flowing on the default EPS Bearer if it does not have assigned TFT.\nAnnex D (normative):UE Presence in Area of Interest\nD.1\tDetermination of UE presence in Area of Interest by AMF\nIf the AMF has requested NG-RAN location reporting as specified in clause 4.10 for the Area Of Interest and UE is in CM-CONNECTED state, including RRC_CONNECTED and RRC_INACTIVE state, the AMF determines the UE presence in the Area of Interest as the reported value from the NG-RAN, as specified in clause D.2.\nIn the case the UE is served by a MBSR, the AMF may consider the additional ULI provided by the NG-RAN node (as defined in clause 5.35A.6 of TS 23.501 [2]) when determining the UE presence in Area of Interest.\nIf the AMF has requested N2 Notification as specified in clause 4.8.3, the AMF determines the UE presence in Area Of Interest as follows, taking N2 Notification from NG-RAN into consideration:\n-\tIN:\n-\tif the UE is in CM-CONNECTED with RRC_CONNECTED state and if the last received User Location Information for the UE is inside the Area Of Interest service area; or\nNOTE 1:\tThe above is valid e.g. under the condition that Area Of Interest border coincides with NG-RAN node service area border(s).\n-\tif the UE is in CM-CONNECTED and if the UE is inside a Registration Area which is completely contained within the Area Of Interest.\n-\tOUT:\n-\tif the UE is in CM-CONNECTED with RRC_CONNECTED state and if the last received User Location Information for the UE is outside the Area Of Interest; or\nNOTE 2:\tThe above is valid e.g. under the condition that Area Of Interest border coincides with NG-RAN node service area border(s).\n-\tif the UE is in CM-CONNECTED and if UE is inside a Registration Area which does not contain any part of Area Of Interest.\n-\tUNKNOWN:\nif none of above conditions for IN or OUT is met.\nOtherwise, AMF determines the UE presence of Area Of Interest as follows:\n-\tIN:\n-\tif the UE is inside the Area Of Interest service area and if the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state; or\n-\tif the Area Of Interest service area is indicated as a RAN node identity and the Parameter Type with value \"RAN timing synchronization status change event\" is included and the UE has indicated a support for registration update procedure due to RAN timing synchronization status as described in clause 5.3.4.4 of TS 23.501 [2] and the most recent N2 connection for the UE is via a RAN Node that is included in the Area Of Interest service area; or\n-\tif the Parameter Type with value \"Adjust AoI based on RA\" is included and the UE is inside a Registration Area which contains at least one Tracking Area that is contained within the Area Of Interest; or\n-\tif the UE is inside a Registration Area which is contained within the Area Of Interest.\n-\tOUT:\n-\tif the UE is outside the Area Of Interest in CM-CONNECTED and the Parameter Type with value \"Adjust AoI based on RA\" is not included; or\n-\tif the Area Of Interest service area is indicated as a RAN node identity and the Parameter Type with value \"RAN timing synchronization status change event\" is included and the UE has indicated a support for registration update procedure due to RAN timing synchronization status as described in clause 5.3.4.4 of TS 23.501 [2] and the most recent N2 connection for the UE is via a RAN Node that is not included in the Area Of Interest service area; or\n-\tif UE is inside a Registration Area which does not contain any part of Area Of Interest.\n-\tUNKNOWN:\nif none of above conditions for IN or OUT is met.\nD.2\tDetermination of UE presence in Area of Interest by NG-RAN\nIf the AMF has requested for the Area of Interest, NG-RAN determines the UE presence of Area Of Interest as follows:\n-\tIN:\n-\tif the UE is inside the Area Of Interest and the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED state; or\n-\tif the UE is inside an RNA which is completely contained within the Area Of Interest.\n-\tOUT:\n-\tif the UE is outside the Area Of Interest in RRC_CONNECTED state; or\n-\tif UE is inside an RNA which does not contain any part of Area Of Interest.\n-\tUNKNOWN:\n-\tif none of above conditions for IN or OUT is met.\nAnnex E (normative):Delegated SMF and PCF discovery in the Home Routed and specific SMF Service Areas scenarios\nE.0\tOverview\nThis Annex describes the option where the SCP is involved in the SMF and PCF selection for following cases:\n-\tPDU Session to be established in Home Routed mode,\n-\tPDU Session requiring an I-SMF as defined in clause\n-\tPCF discovery in the Roaming scenario\nNOTE:\tNo similar Annex is foreseen to describe the discovery and selection of other NF involving the SCP.\nE.1\tDelegated SMF discovery in the Home Routed scenario\nFigure E.1: Delegated Discovery of SMF in the Home Routed Scenario\n1.\tThe AMF sends Nnrf_NFDiscovery Request to the V-NRF. The AMF may indicate the maximum number of H-SMF instances to be returned by the NRF.\n2.\tThe NRF in VPLMN and NRF in HPLMN interact using the Nnrf_NFDiscovery service. See step 2 in clause 4.17.5.\n3.\tThe AMF gets Nnrf_NFDiscovery service response with one or more profile(s) of SMF(s) in HPLMN.\n4.\tThe AMF selects an SMF instance in HPLMN (H-SMF endpoint).\n5.\tThe AMF builds a Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request that includes the endpoint (e.g. URI) of the selected H-SMF in the body of the request. If the AMF supports delegated SMF discovery and is configured to apply it, the AMF sends the Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request with Discovery & Selection parameters to the selected SCP in the VPLMN. Discovery & Selection parameters include S-NSSAI, UE location (TAI), i.e. parameter for V-SMF selection.\n6.\t[Optional] The SCP in VPLMN sends Nnrf_NFDiscovery Request to the V-NRF using Discovery & Selection parameters received from AMF.\n7.\t[Optional] The SCP in VPLMN gets Nnrf_NFDiscovery service response with profile(s) of SMF(s) in VPLMN.\n8.\tThe SCP in VPLMN selects an SMF instance in VPLMN (V-SMF), which supports the Discovery & Selection parameters received earlier from the AMF.\n9.\tThe SCP in VPLMN forwards the Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request received from the AMF to the selected SMF instance in VPLMN.\n10.\tIf the V-SMF does not support delegated SMF discovery or is not configured to apply it (Case A), the V-SMF sends Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Request directly to the H-SMF. Otherwise (Case B), the V-SMF sends the Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Request to the SCP in VPLMN but adds Discovery & Selection parameter set to H-SMF endpoint received from the AMF. In both cases, the V-SMF uses the received endpoint (e.g. URI) of the selected H-SMF to construct the target destination to be addressed.\nNOTE:\tThe Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Request sent by the V-SMF in Case A and in Case B is the same apart from the Discovery & Selection parameter. The Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Request received by the H-SMF in Case A and in Case B is the same.\n11.\tThe SCP in VPLMN sends a Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Request to the selected SMF instance in HPLMN indicated in step 10.\nWhen the V-SMF responds to AMF with Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Response as in clause 4.3.2.2.2 in step 3b, if the AMF has not stored the SMF Service Area for the V-SMF, the AMF shall obtain the SMF Service Area for the concerned V-SMF from the NRF using the Nnrf_NFManagement_NFStatusSubscribe service operation.\nE.2\tDelegated I-SMF discovery\nFigure E.2: Delegated Discovery of I-SMF\nThe following impacts are applicable to clause 4.23.5 (PDU Session Establishment procedure) to support delegated SMF discovery:\n1.\tIf the AMF supports delegated SMF discovery and is configured to apply it, the AMF sends an Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request together with discovery and selection parameters to a SCP. The discovery and selection parameters include S-NSSAI, DNN, TAI that corresponds to the UE location required SMF capability (e.g. support of ATSSS).\n2.\t[Optional] The SCP sends an Nnrf_NFDiscovery Request to the NRF. The request includes discovery and selection parameters received from AMF in step 1.\n3.\t[Optional] The SCP gets Nnrf_NFDiscovery service response. The response may include one or more profile(s) of SMF(s).\nDepending on the available information, the SCP may either execute steps in Case A or in Case B.\nCase A There are, either in the NRF response or discovered by the SCP, one or more SMF instances that support Discovery and selection criteria set by the AMF.\n4.\tThe SCP selects an SMF instance.\n5.\tThe SCP forwards the Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request to the selected SMF instance.\nCase B There is, either in the NRF response or discovered by the SCP, no SMF instance that supports Discovery and selection criteria set by the AMF.\n6.\tThe SCP returns an Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Response to the AMF with an error 'NF not found'\n7.\tThe AMF sends Nnrf_NFDiscovery Request to the NRF. The AMF may indicate the maximum number of SMF instances to be returned by the NRF.\n8.\tThe AMF gets Nnrf_NFDiscovery service response with one or more profile(s) of SMF(s).\n9.\tThe AMF selects an SMF instance endpoint.\n10.\tThe AMF builds a Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request that contains the endpoint (e.g. URI) of the selected SMF in the body of the request. If the AMF supports delegated SMF discovery and is configured to apply it, the AMF sends the Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request to a SCP together with Discovery and selection parameters that include S-NSSAI, TAI that corresponds to the UE location, i.e. parameter for I-SMF selection.\n11.\t[Optional] The SCP sends an Nnrf_NFDiscovery Request to the NRF. The request includes Discovery and selection parameters received from AMF (including the TAI that corresponds to the UE location).\n12.\t[Optional] The SCP gets Nnrf_NFDiscovery service response. The response may include one or more profile(s) of I-SMF(s).\n13.\tThe SCP selects an I-SMF instance that supports the TAI.\n14.\tThe SCP forwards the Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request received from the AMF to the selected I-SMF instance.\n15.\tIf the I-SMF does not support delegated SMF discovery or is not configured to apply it (Case A), the I-SMF sends Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Request directly to the SMF. Otherwise (Case B), the I-SMF sends the Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Request to the SCP but adds Discovery & Selection parameter set to the SMF endpoint received from AMF. In both cases the I-SMF uses the received endpoint (e.g. URI) of the selected SMF to construct the target destination to be addressed.\nNOTE:\tThe Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Request sent by the I-SMF in Case A and in Case B is the same apart from the Discovery & Selection parameter. The Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Request received by the SMF in Case A and in Case B is the same.\n16.\tThe SCP forwards the Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Request to the selected SMF instance indicated in step 15.\nThe procedure continues as described in clause 4.3.2.2.2 from Step 7.\nDifference comparing to procedure defined in clause 4.3.2.2.2, the V-SMF and V-UPF are replaced by I-SMF and I-UPF and H-SMF and H-UPF are replaced by SMF and UPF(PSA) respectively. Also only the S-NSSAI with the value defined by the serving PLMN is sent to the SMF.\nWhen the I-SMF responds to AMF with Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Response as in clause 4.3.2.2.2 in Step 3b, if the AMF has not stored the SMF Service Area for the I-SMF, the AMF shall obtain the SMF Service Area for the concerned I-SMF from the NRF using the Nnrf_NFManagement_NFStatusSubscribe service operation.\nE.3\tDelegated PCF discovery in the Roaming scenario\nFigure E.3: Delegated Discovery of PCF in the Home Routed Scenario\n1.\tThe AMF sends Nnrf_NFDiscovery Request to the V-NRF in order to discover a PCF in HPLMN. The AMF may indicate the maximum number of H-PCF instances to be returned by the NRF.\n2.\tThe NRF in VPLMN and NRF in HPLMN interact using the Nnrf_NFDiscovery service. See step 2 in clause 4.17.5.\n3.\tThe AMF gets Nnrf_NFDiscovery service response with one or more profile(s) of PCF(s) in HPLMN.\n4.\tThe AMF selects a PCF instance in HPLMN.\n5.\tThe AMF builds a Npcf_UEPolicyControl Request that contains the H-PCF ID in the body of the request. If the AMF supports delegated PCF discovery and is configured to apply it, the AMF forwards the Npcf_UEPolicyControl Request to the selected SCP in VPLMN together with Discovery & Selection parameter set to V-PCF instance ID.\n6.\tThe SCP in VPLMN selects the corresponding (V-)PCF instance for UE policy association based on Discovery & Selection parameter received from the AMF.\n7.\tThe SCP in VPLMN forwards the Npcf_UEPolicyControl Request to the selected PCF instance in VPLMN.\n8.\tIf the V-PCF does not support delegated PCF discovery or is not configured to apply it (Case A), the V-PCF sends Npcf_UEPolicyControl Request to the selected PCF instance. Otherwise (Case B), the V-PCF sends the Npcf_UEPolicyControl Request to a SCP in VPLMN but adds Discovery & Selection parameter set to H-PCF ID.\n9.\tThe SCP in VPLMN sends an Npcf_UEPolicyControl Request to the selected PCF instance in HPLMN indicated in step 8.\nAnnex F (informative):Information flows for 5GS integration with TSN or with Deterministic Networking\nThis annex defines the procedures for 5GS integration with TSN fully-centralized model as defined in IEEE Std 802.1Q [66], it includes 5GS Bridge information reporting and 5GS Bridge configuration.\nThe annex defines also the procedures for 5GS interworking with the TSN deployed in the transport network, as described in clause 5.28a of TS 23.501 [2].\nF.1\t5GS Bridge information reporting\nFigure F.1-1: 5GS Bridge information reporting\nIdentities of 5GS Bridge and UPF/NW-TT ports are pre-configured on the UPF based on deployment. The SMF requests the UPF/NW-TT to measure and report the clock drift between the TSN GM time and 5GS GM time for one or more TSN time domains.\n1.\tPDU Session Establishment as defined clause 4.3.2.2.1-1 is used to establish a PDU Session serving for TSC.\nDuring this procedure, the SMF selects a UPF, which supports functions as defined in clause 5.28.1 of TS 23.501 [2], for the PDU Session.\nDuring this procedure, the SMF receives the UE-DS-TT residence time, DS-TT MAC address for this PDU Session and port management capabilities from the DS-TT/UE in PDU Session Establishment request and receives the allocated port number for DS-TT Ethernet port and user-plane Node ID in N4 Session Establishment Response message. The UPF allocates the port number for DS-TT, user-plane Node ID after receiving N4 Session Establishment Request message.\n2.\tThe SMF sends the information received in step 1 to the TSN AF via PCF to establish/modify the 5GS Bridge. The Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Notify message in step 2b is delivered via the pre-configured AF session as described in clause 4.16.5.1. The TSN AF stores the binding relationship between 5GS user-plane Node ID, MAC address of the DS-TT Ethernet port and also updates 5GS bridge delay as defined in clause 5.27.5 of TS 23.501 [2] for future configuration. The TSN AF requests creation of a new AF session associated with the MAC address of the DS-TT Ethernet port using the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create operation (step 2c) and subscribes for TSN events over the newly created AF session using the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Subscribe operation (step 2d).\nIn the case of TSN AF support for direct notification from UPF for PMIC and UMIC, the subscription in step 2d has following additional information: \"Notification Target Address for PMIC/UMIC UPF event\" and \"Correlation ID for PMIC/UMIC UPF event\".\nUsing the 5GS user-plane Node ID received in step 2b the TSN AF subscribes with the NW-TT for receiving user plane node management information changes for the 5GS bridge indicated by the 5GS user-plane Node ID as described in clause 5.28.3.1 of TS 23.501 [2].\nAfter receiving a User plane node Management Information Container (UMIC) containing the NW-TT port numbers, the TSN AF subscribes with the NW-TT for receiving NW-TT port management information changes for the NW-TT port indicated by each of the NW-TT port numbers as described in clause 5.28.3.1 of TS 23.501 [2].\nThe TSN AF can use any PDU Session to subscribe with the NW-TT for bridge or port management information notifications. Similarly, the UPF can use any PDU Session to send bridge or port management information notifications.\n3.\tIf DS-TT has indicated support for the TSN Time domain number in the port management capabilities, TSN AF provides the TSN Time domain number to DS-TT. Optionally, TSN AF provides the TSN Time domain number to NW-TT.\n4.\tIf supported according to the port management capabilities received from DS-TT, TSN AF retrieves txPropagationDelay and Traffic Class table from DS-TT. TSN AF also retrieves txPropagationDelay and Traffic Class table from NW-TT.\nNOTE:\tIt is assumed that distribution of TSN GM time towards NW-TT and DS-TT for the TSN time domain is activated before TSN AF retrieves txPropagationDelay so that DS-TT and NW-TT can convert txPropagationDelay from 5GS time to TSN time before reporting txPropagationDelay to TSN AF.\n5.\tIf DS-TT supports neighbor discovery according to the port management capabilities received from DS-TT, then TSN AF:\n-\tprovides DS-TT port neighbor discovery configuration to DS-TT to configure and activate the LLDP agent in DS-TT;\n-\tsubscribes to receive Neighbor discovery information for each discovered neighbor of DS-TT (see Table K.1-1 in TS 23.501 [2].\nIf DS-TT does not support neighbor discovery, then TSN AF:\n-\tprovides DS-TT port neighbor discovery configuration to NW-TT to configure and activate the LLDP agent in NW-TT to perform neighbor discovery on behalf of DS-TT;\n-\tsubscribes to receive Neighbor discovery information for each discovered neighbor of DS-TT from NW-TT (see Table K.1-1 in TS 23.501 [2].\nTSN AF:\n-\twrites NW-TT port neighbor discovery configuration to NW-TT to configure and activate the LLDP agent in NW-TT;\n-\tsubscribes to receive Neighbor discovery information for each discovered neighbor of NW-TT (see Table K.1-1 in TS 23.501 [2]).\n6.\tTSN AF receives notifications from DS-TT (If DS-TT supports neighbour discovery) and NW-TT on discovered neighbors of DS-TT and NW-TT.\n7.\tThe TSN AF constructs the above received information as 5GS Bridge information and sends them to the CNC to register a new TSN Bridge or update an existing TSN Bridge.\nF.2\t5GS Bridge configuration\nFor 5GS integrating with fully-centralized model TSN network, the CNC provides TSN information to the AF.\nFigure F.2-1: 5GS Bridge information configuration\n1.\tCNC provides per-stream filtering and policing parameters according to clause 8.6.5.2.1 of IEEE Std 802.1Q [66] to AF and the AF uses them to derive TSN QoS information and related flow information. The CNC provides the forwarding rule to AF according to clause 8.8.1 of IEEE Std 802.1Q [66]. The TSN AF uses this information to identify the DS-TT MAC address of corresponding PDU session.\nThe AF determines if the stream is UE-UE TSC and divides the stream into UL and DL streams for PDU Sessions corresponding to ingress DS-TT Ethernet port and egress DS-TT port(s) as specified in clause 5.28.2 of TS 23.501 [2] and separately triggers following procedures for the UL and DL streams.\n2.\tThe AF determines the MAC address of a PDU Session based on the previous stored associations, then triggers an AF request procedure. The AF request includes the DS-TT MAC address of the PDU session.\nBased on the information received from the CNC, 5GS bridge delay information and the UE-DS-TT residence time, the TSN AF determines the TSN QoS information and TSC Assistance Container for one or more TSN streams and sends them to the PCF. The TSN AF also provides Service Data Flow Filter containing Flow description also includes Ethernet Packet Filters.\n3.\tWhen PCF receives the AF request, the PCF finds the correct SMF based on the DS-TT MAC address of the PDU session and notifies the SMF via Npcf_SMPolicyControl_UpdateNotify message.\nAfter mapping the received TSN QoS parameters for TSN streams to 5GS QoS, the PCF triggers Npcf_SMPolicyControl_UpdateNotify message to update the PCC rule to the SMF. The PCC rule includes the Ethernet Packet Filters, the 5GS QoS profile along with TSC Assistance Container.\n4.\tSMF may trigger the PDU Session Modification procedure to establish/modify a QoS Flow to transfer the TSN streams. During this procedure, the SMF provides the information received in PCC rules to the UPF via N4 Session Modification procedure.\nUpon reception of the TSC Assistance Container, the SMF determine the TSCAI for QoS flow and sends the TSCAI along with the QoS profile to the NG RAN.\n5.\tIf needed, the CNC provides additional information (e.g. the gate control list as defined in clause 8.6.8.4 of IEEE Std 802.1Q [66]) to the TSN AF.\n6.\tThe AF determines the MAC address of a PDU Session for the configured port based on the previous stored associations, this is used to deliver the Port Management information to the correct SMF that manages the port via PCF. The AF triggers an AF request procedure. The AF request includes the DS-TT MAC address (i.e. the MAC address of the PDU Session), TSN QoS Parameters, Port Management information Container and the related port number as defined in clause 5.28.3 of TS 23.501 [2]. The port number is used by SMF to decide whether the configured port is in DS-TT or NW-TT.\nNOTE:\tWhen TSN AF needs to convey 5GS Bridge- or NW-TT port-specific information to the NW-TT/UPF, the TSN AF chooses an arbitrary AF Session related to the corresponding 5GS bridge and sends the 5GS Bridge-specific information inside a User plane node Management Information Container (UMIC) or NW-TT Port Management Information Container (NW-TT PMIC) as specified in TS 23.501 [2].\n7.\tThe PCF determines the SMF based on the MAC address received in the AF request, the PCF maps the TSN QoS information provided by the AF to PCC rules as described in clause 5.28.4 of TS 23.501 [2]. The PCF includes the TSC Assistance Container received from the AF with the PCC rules and forwards it to the SMF. The PCF transparently transports the received Port Management information Container and related port number to SMF via Npcf_SMPolicyControl_UpdateNotify message.\n8a.\tIf the SMF decides the port is on DS-TT based on the received port number, the SMF transports the received Port Management information Container to the UE/DS-TT in PDU Session Modification Request message.\n8b.\tIf the SMF decides the port is on NW-TT based on the received port number, the SMF transports the received Port Management information Container to the UPF/NW-TT in N4 Session Modification Request message. SMF provides the Ethernet Packet Filters as part of the N4 Packet Detection rule to the UPF/NW-TT.\nIf the UPF sends a Clock Drift Report to the SMF as described in clause 5.27.2 of TS 23.501 [2], the SMF adjusts the Burst Arrival Time, Periodicity and Survival Time (if present) from a TSN grandmaster clock to the 5G clock and sends the updated TSCAI to NG-RAN.\nF.3\tBMCA procedure\nFigure F.3-1: BMCA procedure\n1.\tPDU Session Establishment is performed as shown in F.1-1 step 1 and 2 for an Ethernet or IP type PDU Session to carry the UMIC or PMIC.\n2.\tThe TSN AF or TSCTSF may subscribe to notifications for the PTP port state changes from UPF/NW-TT.\n3.\tThe UPF/NW-TT receives the Announce message via User -plane from DS-TT connectivity established using PDU session, or via NW-TT port over N6.\nAs Announce message is a periodic message, after step 3, the UPF/NW-TT will receive Announce messages regularly.\n4.\tThe NW-TT runs the BMCA algorithm in order to determine the PTP port state for the DS-TT port(s) and NW-TT port(s).\nBMCA will be triggered after receiving the Announce message.\n5.\tIf the BMCA procedure in NW-TT determines to use Announce message from the external grandmaster PTP instance, the UPF/NW-TT regenerates the Announce message based on the received Announce message for each Leader PTP port on the NW-TT and DS-TT(s) port for this PTP domain. The NW-TT/UPF forwards the regenerated Announce messages to the PDU session(s) related to the Leader PTP ports on the DS-TT(s).\nNOTE:\tLeader and Follower terms in this specification are aligned with NOTE 2 in clause 5.27.1.2.2.1 of TS 23.501 [2]..\n6.\tIf the TSN AF or TSCTSF has subscribed for notifications for the PTP port state changes, the UPF/NW-TT reports any changes to the PTP port states to the TSN AF or TSCTSF via UMIC (for DS-TT ports) or PMIC (for NW-TT ports).\n7.\tBased on the notification for the PTP port state changes, the TSN AF or TSCTSF may request appropriate QoS treatment and PDU Session modification may then be triggered to modify the QoS Flow carrying the gPTP messages over user plane in order to be compliant with the IEEE Std 802.1AS [75] delay recommendation for carrying gPTP messages as in clause 5.27.1.6 of TS 23.501 [2].\nF.4\t5GS interworking with TSN deployed in the transport network\nFor 5GS to control the IEEE TSN features deployed in the transport network, the SMF/CUC interacts with the CNC in the transport network (TN CNC).\nFigure F.4-1: 5GS Bridge information configuration\n1.\tThe UE establishes a PDU Session as described in clause 4.3.2.2.1.\n2.\tDuring the PDU Session Establishment procedure, the SMF/CUC requests the UPF to assign the N3 tunnel information via N4 Session Establishment or Modification procedure. If interworking with TSN deployed in the transport network is supported (see clause 4.4.8 of TS 23.501 [2]), and the UPF supports CN-TL, the SMF/CUC includes a TL-Container to the N4 Session Establishment or Modification request including a get-request to the TL-Container, as described in clause 5.28a.2 of TS 23.501 [2].\nThe UPF responds with a N4 Session Establishment or Modification response. If the UPF supports CN-TL, the UPF includes a TL-Container to the response. The TL-Container includes a get-response as described in clause 5.28a.2 of TS 23.501 [2]. The SMF/CUC stores the information provided in the get-response.\n3.\tDuring the PDU Session Establishment procedure, the SMF/CUC requests the NG-RAN to assign the N3 tunnel information by invoking the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer request. The SMF/CUC includes a TL-Container to the N2 SM information in the request, the TL-Container contains a get-request as described in clause 5.28a.2 of TS 23.501 [2].\nThe NG-RAN responds with a N2 SM information. If the NG-RAN supports AN-TL, the NG-RAN includes a TL-Container to the N2 SM information. The TL-Container includes a get-response as described in clause 5.28a.2 of TS 23.501 [2]. The SMF/CUC stores the information provided in the get-response.\n4.\tThe AF (TSCTSF, AF, NEF or TSN AF) invokes the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create/Update request. This may be due to reception of Ntsctsf_QoSandTSCAssistance_Create/Update request by the TSCTSF as described in clause 4.15.6.6 or clause 4.15.6.6.a, or due to reception of 5GS Bridge configuration by the TSN AF as described in clause F.2. The TSN AF or TSCTSF determines the TSC Assistance Container for one or more TSC streams and sends them to the PCF.\n5-6.When PCF receives the request, the PCF initiates an SM Policy Association Modification procedure. The PCF notifies the corresponding SMF/CUC via Npcf_SMPolicyControl_UpdateNotify message as described in clause 4.16.5.2. The PCF updates the PCC rule to the SMF/CUC. The PCC rule includes the 5GS QoS profile along with TSC Assistance Container.\nSMF/CUC triggers the PDU Session Modification procedure as described in clause 4.3.3.2 to establish a QoS Flow to transfer the TSC streams.\n7.\tDuring the PDU Session Modification procedure, the SMF/CUC provides the information received in PCC rules to the UPF via N4 Session Modification procedure. The SMF/CUC may instruct the UPF to assign a distinct N3 tunnel end point address for the QoS Flow as described in clause M.1 of TS 23.501 [2].\nThe UPF responds with a N4 Session Modification response.\n8.\tDuring the PDU Session Modification procedure, the SMF/CUC provides the information received in PCC rules to the NG-RAN by invoking the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer request. The SMF also determines the TSCAI for the QoS Flow(s) and sends the TSCAI along with the QoS profile(s) to the NG-RAN. The SMF/CUC may instruct the NG-RAN to assign a distinct N3 tunnel end point address for the QoS Flow as described in clause M.1 of TS 23.501 [2].\nThe NG-RAN responds with a N2 SM information.\n9.\tThe SMF/CUC determines the merged stream requirements in the TSN UNI towards the TN CNC as described in Annex M of TS 23.501 [2]. The TN CNC uses the merged stream requirements as input to select respective path(s) and calculate schedules in TN.\n10.\tBased on the results, the TN CNC provides a Status group that contains the merged end station communication-configuration back to the SMF/CUC.\n11.\t[Conditional] If the response from TN CNC includes InterfaceConfiguration, the SMF/CUC triggers the PDU Session Modification procedure as described in clause 4.3.3.2 to modify the QoS Flow to transfer the TSC streams.\n12.\t[Conditional] During the PDU Session Modification procedure, if the UPF supports CN-TL, the SMF/CUC invokes N4 Session Modification procedure and includes TL-Container(s) to the N4 Session Modification request including a set-request to the TL-Container as described in clause 5.28a.2 of TS 23.501 [2].\nThe UPF responds with a N4 Session Modification response. If the UPF supports CN-TL, the UPF includes a TL-Container to the response. The TL-Container includes a set-response as described in clause 5.28a.2 of TS 23.501 [2].\n13. [Conditional] During the PDU Session Modification procedure, if the NG-RAN supports AN-TL, the SMF/CUC invokes the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer request. The SMF/CUC includes TL-Container(s) to the N2 SM information in the request, the TL-Container contains a set-request as described in clause 5.28a.2 of TS 23.501 [2]. The SMF/CUC may also update the TSCAI in the NG-RAN for the BAT in DL direction as described in Annex M, clause M.1 of TS 23.501 [2], if the SMF/CUC received a TimeAwareOffset or AccumulatedLatency from TN CNC for a downlink stream (i.e. for a Talker in the UPF/CN-TL) in step 7.\nThe NG-RAN responds with a N2 SM information. If the NG-RAN supports AN-TL, the NG-RAN includes TL-Container(s) to the N2 SM information.

When Framed Routes applies, the SMF reports to the PCF Framed Route information.\n2.\tSMF reports device port related information to PCF. When prefix delegation applies, the SMF reports to the PCF prefixes delegated to the UE by IPv6 prefix delegation. The PCF notifies TSCTSF of the Bridge/Router information. The TSCTSF subscribes for notifications on the Bridge/Router information and also subscribes for notifications on Reporting of extra addresses, so that the TSCTSF is notified when the SMF has reported to the PCF the Framed Route information or prefixes delegated to UE via IPv6 prefix delegation corresponding to the PDU Session.\n3-4.\tUsing the 5GS user-plane Node ID received in step 2b the TSCTSF can subscribe with the NW-TT for receiving user plane node management information changes for the 5GS router indicated by the 5GS user-plane Node ID in case it does not yet have such a subscription, as described in clause 5.28.3.1 of TS 23.501 [2].\nAfter receiving a User plane node Management Information Container (UMIC) containing the NW-TT port numbers, the TSCTSF can subscribe with the NW-TT for receiving NW-TT port management information changes for the NW-TT port indicated by each of the NW-TT port numbers as described in clause 5.28.3.1 of TS 23.501 [2].\nThe TSCTSF can use any PDU Session to subscribe with the NW-TT for node or port management information notifications. Similarly, the UPF can use any PDU Session to send bridge or port management information notifications.\n5.\tThe TSCTSF may provide collected exposure information to the DetNet controller. The information being reported to the DetNet controller is defined in clause 5.28.5.2 of TS 23.501 [2].\nF.6\t5GS DetNet node configuration\nThe DetNet controller triggers the procedure to provide Deterministic Networking specific parameters to 5GS.\nFigure F.6-1: Deterministic Networking specific parameter provisioning\n1.\tThe DetNet controller provides YANG data model configuration to the TSCTSF. The TSCTSF uses the identifier of the incoming and outgoing interfaces to determine the affected PDU Session(s) and flow direction, whether it is uplink or downlink as described in more detail in clause 5.28.5 of TS 23.501 [2]. The TSCTSF also determines if the flow is UE to UE in which case two PDU Sessions will be affected for the flow and the TSCTSF breaks up the requirements to individual requirements for the PDU Sessions.\n2.\tThe TSCTSF uses the traffic requirements in the YANG configuration as described in clause 6.1.3.23b of TS 23.503 [20]. The TSCTSF also constructs the TSCAC for each flow description.\n3.\tThe TSCTSF provides the mapped parameters and the flow description to the PCF(s) on a per AF Session basis.\n4.\tThe PCF authorizes the request from TSCTSF. If the PCF determines that the requirements can't be authorized, it rejects the request. Once the PCF authorizes the request, the PCF updates the SMF with corresponding new PCC rule(s) with PCF initiated SM Policy Association Modification procedure as described in clause 4.16.5.2.\nThe SMF applies the received PCC rules. This can induce creating a new QoS flow to the PDU session and triggers the resource allocation in the RAN.\n5.\tPCF provides response to the TSCTSF.\n6.\tThe TSCTSF provides response to the DetNet controller.\nAnnex G (normative):Support of GERAN/UTRAN access by SMF+PGW-C\nThis annex applies when the SMF+PGW-C is enhanced to support GERAN/UTRAN access via Gn/Gp interface as specified in Annex L of TS 23.501 [2].\nNOTE 1:\tFor the interface with the serving node of the UE, the SMF+PGW-C is assumed to behave as the Control Plane of the PGW described in Annex D of TS 23.401 [13].\nSMF+PGW-C is selected by the SGSN using existing mechanism as specified in Annex A of TS 23.060 [79].\nNOTE 2\tIf network deployment requires both SMF+PGW-C and legacy PGW, selection of SMF+PGW-C by SGSN can be achieved based on e.g. APN and optionally APN-OI Replacement as specified Annex A of TS 23.060 [79].\nWhen a SMF+PGW-C is used for GERAN/UTRAN access, at PDP context activation, the SMF+PGW-C allocates a PDU Session ID (in the network range) and uses this PDU Session ID over SBI interface (e.g. N7).\nThe following procedures from TS 23.060 [79] are not supported when SMF+PGW-C is used for GERAN/UTRAN access:\n-\tNetwork requested PDP Context Activation Procedure (clause 9.2.2.2 of TS 23.060 [79]).\n-\tSecondary PDP Context Activation Procedure (clause 9.2.2.1.1 of TS 23.060 [79]).\n-\tNetwork Requested Secondary PDP Context Activation Procedure using Gn (clause 9.2.2.1.3 of TS 23.060 [79]).\nWhen SMF+PGW-C is used for GERAN/UTRAN access and interacts with PCF, the SMF+PGW-C uses SM policy association procedures as specified in clause 4.11.0a.2 with the following modification:\n-\tThe SMF+PGW-C performs mapping of QoS parameters as follows:\n-\tThe SMF+PGW-C maps the Release 99 QoS parameters received from Gn/Gp interface to EPS QoS parameters as specified in Annex E of TS 23.401 [13], which is then used to derive QoS parameters over N7 interface as specified in clause 4.11.0a.2.\n-\tthe SMF+PGW-C uses QoS parameters over N7 interface to derive EPS QoS parameters as specified in clause 4.11.0a.2, which is then mapped to Release 99 QoS parameters for Gn/Gp interface as specified in Annex E of TS 23.401 [13].\n-\tFor SM Policy Association Establishment Procedure, the SMF+PGW-C invokes Npcf_SMPolicyControl_Create Service operation taking input from the information elements received in Create PDP Context Request message (specified in TS 23.060 [79]), including mapping of QoS parameters as mentioned above as well as GERAN/UTRAN location management related information.\n-\tFor SM Policy Association Modification procedure initiated by the SMF+PGW-C, the SMF+PGW-C invokes Npcf_SMPolicyControl_Update Service operation taking input from the information elements received in Update PDP Context Request message (specified in TS 23.060 [79]), including mapping of QoS parameters as mentioned above, as well as GERAN/UTRAN location management related information.\n-\tFor SM Policy Association Modification procedure initiated by the PCF, the SMF+PGW-C may receive PCC Rules and PDU Session Policy Information. The SMF+PGW-C performs mapping of QoS parameters as mentioned above.\n-\tFor SM Policy Association Termination procedure, the SMF+PGW-C invokes Npcf_SMPolicyControl_Delete service operation (including GERAN/UTRAN location management related information) when receiving Delete PDP Context Request message (specified in TS 23.060 [79]).\n-\tEven though N7 supports Ethernet PDU Session Type, as Ethernet PDN Type is not supported in GERAN/UTRAN, it is assumed that if the UE moves from E-UTRAN to GERAN/UTRAN, Ethernet PDN connections are released and thus no information related with Ethernet PDU Session Type shall be exchanged over N7 when a UE is served by GERAN/UTRAN.\n-\tEven though GERAN/UTRAN specifications foresee other alternatives, the Bearer Binding is performed by the SMF+PGW-C acting as a PGW.\n-\tAccess Network Information reporting with a granularity of GERAN/UTRAN cell is supported over N7 and N5.\nWhen the UE moves between E-UTRAN and GERAN/UTRAN, the SMF+PGW-C may invoke SM Policy Association Modification procedure based on the Policy Control Request Triggers as specified in TS 23.503 [20].\nNOTE 3:\tSupport for IP address preservation upon indirect mobility between 5GS and GERAN/UTRAN for PDN sessions established in EPC is described in clause 5.17.2.4 of TS 23.501 [2]. IP address preservation is not supported for direct mobility between 5GS and GERAN/UTRAN, nor for indirect mobility cases when the PDN session is established in 5GS or in GERAN/UTRAN.\nNOTE 4:\tUsage of SMF+PGW-C to serve a PDP context requires no change to SGSN(s) (and thus to roaming partners in Home Routed roaming) as it is assumed that DNS records are properly configured to map APN to SMF+PGW-C acting as PGW.\nAnnex H (normative):Support of EAP-based secondary authentication and authorization by DN-AAA over EPC\nH.1\tIntroduction\nSecondary authentication/authorization by a DN-AAA Server during the establishment of a PDN connection over 3GPP access to EPC, is supported based on following principles:\n-\tA SMF+PGW-C shall be used to serve DNN(s) requiring secondary authentication/authorization by a DN-AAA Server.\n-\tFor secondary authentication/authorization by a DN-AAA Server, the SMF+PGW-C runs the same procedures with PCF, UDM and DN-AAA and uses the same corresponding interfaces, as defined in clause 4.3.2, regardless of whether the UE is served by EPC or 5GC.\n-\tIf the UE has included the PDU Session ID in PCO, the UE may indicate in the PCO within the PDN connection establishment request its support for EAP-based secondary authentication and authorization by DN-AAA over EPC. The UE may also include the DN-specific identity in the PCO. The SMF+PGW-C may reject the PDN connection establishment if the UE does not support EAP-based secondary authentication and authorization by DN-AAA over EPC while local policies tell that secondary authentication and authorization by DN-AAA is mandatory to access to the DN. When a PDU Session is established, the UE may also indicate via 5GSM capability parameter that it supports secondary DN authentication and authorization over EPC.\n-\tThe interface towards the UE is different (usage of EPC NAS instead of 5GC NAS) between the EPC and 5GC cases.\n-\tThe MME and SGW are not impacted by the procedure. Specific exchanges between the UE and the SMF+PGW-C for secondary authentication/authorization by a DN-AAA Server are carried via PCO. This includes the support of EAP exchanges between the UE and the DN-AAA Server.\n-\tAs it is only possible to exchange PCO once between the UE and the PGW during PDN connection establishment, the PDN connection is established before EAP-based secondary authentication/authorization by a DN-AAA Server takes place.\n-\tWhen secondary authentication/authorization by a DN-AAA Server has successfully taken place, the SMF+PGW-C allows traffic exchange at the UPF and indicates to the UE that User plane traffic is now possible.\nH.2\tProcedures\nH.2.1\tSecondary authentication and authorization by DN-AAA at PDN Connection Establishment\nIn the figure H.2.1-1, the execution of the secondary authentication and authorization by DN-AAA is specified. The procedure assumes that:\n-\tThe APN is associated with the selection of a SMF+PGW-C to serve APN(s) that require secondary authentication and authorization by DN-AAA at PDN connection establishment.\n-\tThe SMF+PGW-C is configured with local policies indicating that the APN requires secondary authentication and authorization by DN-AAA at PDN connection establishment.\nFigure H.2.1-1: EAP-based secondary authentication and authorization by DN-AAA at PDN connection establishment\n0.\tAs steps 1 - 13 of Figure 5.3.2.1-1 in TS 23.401 [13] (Attach Request) or as steps 1 to 3 of Figure 5.10.2 in TS 23.401 [13] (UE requested PDN connectivity) with following modifications: The UE may indicate in PCO its capability to support EAP-based secondary DN authentication over EPC if the UE included the PDU Session ID in PCO. The UE may also include the DN-specific identity.\n1.\tThe SMF+PGW-C gets subscription data from UDM as defined in step 4 of Figure 4.3.2.2.1-1 (not shown in Figure H.2.1-1). The procedure assumes that SMF configuration or subscription data from UDM require EAP-based secondary authentication and authorization by DN-AAA.\nSecondary DN authorization may be invoked as described in TS 29.561 [63]. During this step the DN-AAA may provide an IP address for the UE and other DN authorization data as described in clause 5.6.6 of TS 23.501 [2].\n2a.\tIf dynamic PCC is to be used for the PDU Session, the SMF+PGW-C performs an SM Policy Association Establishment procedure as defined in clause 4.16.4 and if Secondary DN authorization has been invoked in step 1, provides to the PCF the PDN Connection parameters received from the DN AAA at step 1 as described in step 5 of Figure 4.3.2.3-1. In this step the SMF+PGW-C may retrieve the PDU Session related policy information and the PCC rule(s) from the PCF, e.g. the authorized Session AMBR.\n2b.\tUPF selection and N4 session establishment is executed with the difference that the SMF+PGW-C configures the UPF+PGW-U to block any UE traffic over the PDN Connection (until the Secondary DN authentication and authorization has been done and is successful).\n3.\tSteps 15-24 in Figure 5.3.2.1-1 of TS 23.401 [13] or steps 5-16 in Figure 5.10.2 of TS 23.401 [13].\nDuring the Attach procedure, at step 15 in Figure 5.3.2.1-1 of TS 23.401 [13] or during UE requested PDN connectivity in step 5 in Figure 5.10.2 of TS 23.401 [13], the SMF+PGW-C includes in PCO, an Indication to the UE that \"UpLink Data is NOT ALLOWED\" on the PDN connection. The UE shall not send Uplink data to the network, until it receives an indication further from the network that \"UpLink Data is ALLOWED\".\nNOTE:\tHow the Indication that Uplink data allowed/not allowed is carried in PCO is defined in TS 24.501 [25].\n4.\t[Conditional] The PGW-C+SMF initiates EAP-based authentication by sending EAP-Request as described in step 2 of Figure 4.3.2.3-1.\n5.\tMultiple round-trip messages as required by the authentication method used by DN-AAA may follow. The PCO including the authentication message from the DN-AAA is transferred to the UE by the SMF+PGW-C in Update Bearer Request and then over S1 by Downlink NAS Transport (steps 4b-4d). The response from the UE is transferred to the SMF+PGW-C in an Uplink NAS Transport over S1 and Update Bearer Response (steps 4e-4g) over EPS.\n6.\tSecondary authentication and authorization by DN-AAA procedure continues as described in step 4 of Figure 4.3.2.3-1.\n7.\tThe SMF+PGW-C updates the N4 rules in the UPF+PGW-U to allow traffic over the PDN Connection. If dynamic PCC is to be used for the PDU Session and the SMF+PGW-C received DN Authorization information from the DN-AAA as part of step 5 or 6 that is different compared to the value received in step 2, the SMF+PGW-C contacts the PCF to update the PDN Connection as described in step 5 of Figure 4.3.2.3-1\n8.\tThe SMF+PGW-C updates the UE by invoking the PDN GW initiated bearer modification without QoS update procedure (figure 5.4.3-1 of TS 23.401 [13]) initiated by sending an Update Bearer Request message to the SGW. The PCO includes an indication that \"UpLink Data is ALLOWED\". The UE confirms the update (see clause 5.4.3 of TS 23.401 [13]).\nIf the UE IP address is to be delivered to the UE over user plane (via Router advertisement or DHCP) then the UE IP address is only delivered to the UE after step 8.\n9.\tAs in step 6 of Figure 4.3.2.3-1.\nThe DN-AAA Server may revoke the authorization for a PDN connection or update DN authorization data for a PDN connection. According to the request from DN-AAA Server, the SMF+PGW-C may release or update the PDN connection.\nAt any time after the PDN connection establishment, the DN-AAA Server or SMF+PGW-C may initiate Secondary Re-authentication procedure for the PDN connection as described in clause 4.3.2.3. Steps 4a-4h are performed to transfer the Secondary Re-authentication message between the DN-AAA Server and the UE. The Secondary Re-authentication procedure may start from step 4a (DN-AAA initiated Secondary Re-authentication procedure) or step 4b (SMF+PGW-C initiated Secondary Re-authentication procedure).\nDuring Secondary Re-authentication, if the SMF+PGW-C receives an indication from the MME that the UE is unreachable then it informs the DN-AAA Server that UE is not reachable for re-authentication. Based on this indication from SMF+PGW-C, the DN-AAA Server may decide to keep the PDN connection or request to release it.\nDN-AAA may initiate DN-AAA Re-authorization without performing re-authentication based on local policy. DN-AAA Re-authorization procedure may involve steps 5 and 6 of Figure H.2.1-1 above.\nDuring Secondary Re-authentication/Re-authorization, if the SMF+PGW-C receives DN Authorization Profile Index and/or DN authorized Session AMBR, the SMF+PGW-C reports the received value(s) to the PCF (as described in TS 23.501 [2]) by triggering the Policy Control Request Trigger as described in TS 23.503 [20].\nAnnex I (informative):Member UE selection without the NEF assistance at the AF\nThis informative Annex describes an example of the procedure that AF selects the FL members by collecting network exposure information in case that no NEF is present in the 5GS. In this example, QoS Monitoring is used for FL Member UE selection.\nNetwork exposure information as described in clause 4.15 of TS 23.502 [4], e.g. UE location reporting from the AMF, user plane information from the UPF and data analytics from NWDAF may be collected and used to assist the AF in application layer Member UE selection e.g. assist in the selection of Member UEs participating in a federating learning operation.\nFigure I-1: Example of Procedure for Member UE selection without the NEF assistance\n1.\t[Optional] The AF requests the location reporting of the UEs from the AMF by invoking existing Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe (Location Reporting).\n2.\t[Optional] The AF initiates direct notification of QoS Monitoring procedure for delay information for the UEs in the candidate list, as defined in steps 1a-5 of clause 6.4.2.1 of TS 23.548 [74].\n3.\t[Optional] The AF requests user plane information, e.g. Throughput UL/DL, Packet transmission, Packet retransmission, for the UEs in the candidate list from UPF.\n4. [Optional] The AF requests analytics from NWDAF by invoking the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe service operation, such as UE Communication, User Data Congestion Analytics, WLAN performance analytics per UE, etc. as defined in TS 23.288 [50].\nNOTE 1:\tIn Steps 1-4, the AF maintains the candidate list itself and collects the Member UE selection information directly from the 5GC and includes the Target UE Identifier(s) for the UEs in the candidate list in the request.\n5.\tThe AF selects members, e.g. for application layer Member UE selection for FL, based on the information collected in steps 1-4.\nNOTE 2:\tWhat information needs to be collected by the AF to perform Member UE selection is decided by the AF itself.\nNOTE 3:\tAF may keep monitoring the information from AMF/UPF/SMF/NWDAF to update the members.\nAnnex J (informative):Support for Personal IoT Networks\nJ.1\tProcedure for PIN service\nFigure J.1-1: Procedure for PIN service\nPIN is a subscribed service, and a user needs to coordinate with the Mobile Network Operator to subscribe for PIN service. When a user subscribes for a PIN, the subscription data includes the (DNN, S NSSAI) combination allocated by the MNO for the PIN service. The PEGC(s) are then provisioned with appropriate URSP rules to enable the PEGC UE to route the PIN traffic using the (DNN, S NSSAI) combination allocated for the PIN. Figure J.1-1 provides a high level procedure for PIN service.\nStep 1:\tStep 1 is performed using O&M.\nA user subscribes to the Mobile Network Operator (MNO) for PIN service. The user provides the list of PEGC(s) that are part of the PIN. The MNO verifies the request, performs necessary checks e.g. whether the UEs are allowed to act as PEGC, whether all the requested PEGC are part of the same UDM group etc. If the request is authorized by the MNO, the MNO:\n-\tallocates a dedicated (DNN, S NSSAI) combination for the PIN;\n-\tif the PIN has a single PEGC, then updates the PEGC subscription with the (DNN, S NSSAI) combination allocated for the PIN;\n-\tif the PIN has more than one PEGC and 5G VN Group is used for a PIN, then creates a group subscription following the 5G VN group management principles as specified in clause 5.29.2 of TS 23.501 [2]. The information on the External Group ID and associated (DNN, S-NSSAI) combination is provided to the AF for PIN;\n-\tif local switching is required, configures in the SMF set and/or in the NRF that the DNN allocated for the PIN is served by a specific SMF set.\nNOTE:\tIt is assumed that all PEGCs that are members of a PIN are part of the same UDM Group ID. If the PEGCs requested by the user for PIN creation are not part of the same UDM Group ID, the MNO migrates all the PEGCs into a single UDM Group ID for creating the group subscription.\nStep 2:\tFor routing PIN traffic by the PEGC, the AF for PIN provides guidance for URSP generation to the 5GC. The AF for PIN uses a UE ID (i.e. GPSI) as the target UE if the PIN contains a single PEGC. If the PIN contains more than one PEGC and 5G VN Group is used for a PIN, then the AF uses External Group ID as the target UEs for providing URSP guidance to the 5GC. The AF request contains (DNN, S NSSAI) combination allocated to the user for the PIN service and the traffic descriptor components in the URSP rule request from the AF for PIN contains the PIN ID.\nThe NEF authorizes the request received from the AF for PIN and stores the information in the UDR as \"Application Data\".\nThe NEF can use the procedure for authorization of service specific parameter provisioning as specified in clause 4.15.6.7a to authorize the AF request by the UDM. In this case:\n-\tif the request is for an individual UE, the UDM checks if the (DNN, S NSSAI) combination in the AF request is allowed for the UE;\n-\tif the request is for a group of UEs and 5G VN Group is used for a PIN, the UDM checks whether the group related data (e.g. (DNN, S-NSSAI) combination group related data, see table 4.15.6.3b-1) is authorized for the group.\nIf the AF request is authorized, the NEF stores the AF requested information in the UDR as the \"Application Data\" (Data Subset setting to \"Service specific information\").\nStep 3:\tThe PCF receives a Nudr_DM_Notify notification of data change from the UDR, generates the URSP rules and initiates UE Policy delivery as specified in clause 4.2.4.3 to provision the URSP rules in the PEGC(s). For routing of PIN traffic by the PEGC(s), the URSP policies provided to the PEGC UE(s) contain URSP rule with PIN ID as traffic descriptor.\nStep 4:\tThe AF for PIN provides QoS requirements for the PIN traffic following procedures for AF requested QoS for a UE or group of UEs not identified by a UE address as specified in clause 4.15.6.14.\nStep 5:\tWhen the PEGC(s) detect PIN traffic, it uses the provisioned URSP rules to identify PDU session to route the traffic as specified in clause 6.6.2.3 of TS 23.503 [20]. The 5GC further performs session management and user plane management as described in Annex P, clause P.2 of TS 23.501 [2].\nWhen 5G VN Group is not used for a PIN and if the PIN contains more than one PEGCs, then the AF request for URSP guidance and QoS requirements is targeted to each individual PEGCs that are part of the PIN.\nAnnex K (informative):Change history\nChange
