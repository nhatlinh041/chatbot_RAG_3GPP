The NF service consumer shall include within the \"evSubsc\" attribute:\n-\tthe notification URI where the NF service consumer receives the events notification encoded as \"eventNotifUri\" attribute; and\n-\tthe events to subscribe to in the \"events\" attribute. For each subscribed event in the \"events\" attribute, the NF service consumer shall include the event identifier within the \"event\" attribute and may include the description of the event reporting mode as specified in clause 4.2.5.2.\nThe events subscription data is provisioned in the \"AM Policy Events Subscription\" sub-resource.\nThe NF service consumer may include within the \"evSubsc\" attribute specific per event subscription information, if applicable, and as described in clause 4.2.2.3.\nIf the PCF cannot successfully fulfil the received HTTP POST request due to the internal PCF error or due to the error in the HTTP POST request, the PCF shall send the HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.7.\nOtherwise, when the PCF receives the HTTP POST request from the NF service consumer, the PCF shall bind the Individual application AM context to the concerned AM policy association. The PCF identifies the AM policy association for which the HTTP POST request applies with the SUPI provided in the \"supi\" attribute within the body of the HTTP POST request:\nIf the PCF fails in executing the binding with the AM policy association, the PCF shall reject the HTTP POST request with an HTTP \"500 Internal Server Error\" response and may include the \"cause\" attribute set to \"POLICY_ASSOCIATION_NOT_AVAILABLE\".\nThe PCF shall check whether the received access and mobility related service information requires access and mobility policies to be created and provisioned in the AMF. Provisioning of access and mobility policies shall be carried out as specified at 3GPP TS 29.507 [16].\nIf the PCF created an \"Individual Application AM Context\" resource, the PCF shall send to the NF service consumer a \"201 Created\" response to the HTTP POST request, as shown in figure 4.2.2.2-1, step 2. The PCF shall include in the \"201 Created\" response:\n-\ta Location header field; and\n-\tan \"AppAmContextRespData\" data type in the content.\nThe Location header field shall contain the URI of the created Individual application AM context resource i.e. \"{apiRoot}/npcf-am-policyauthorization/<apiVersion>/app-am-contexts/{appAmContextId}\".\nThe \"AppAmContextRespData\" data type in the response content shall contain the representation of the created \"Individual application AM context\" resource within the \"AppAmContextData\" data type. When the request included event subscription information:\n-\tthe \"AppAmContextData\" data type shall also include the \"AM Policy Events Subscription\" sub-resource representation within the \"evSubsc\" attribute; and\n-\twhen the NF service consumer requested the immediate reporting and the current value is available, the \"AppAmContextRespData\" data type shall include the corresponding event(s) notification, encoding the event identifier within the \"repEvents\" attribute and the applicable event(s) information as specified within the \"AmEventsNotification\" data type.\nThe acknowledgement towards the NF service consumer should take place before or in parallel with any required access and mobility policy provisioning towards the AMF.\nNOTE:\tThe behaviour when the NF service consumer does not receive the HTTP response message, or when it arrives after the internal timer waiting for it has expired, or when it arrives with an indication different than a success indication, are outside the scope of this specification and is based on operator policy.",
