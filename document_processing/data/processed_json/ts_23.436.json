Data Collection Coordination is supported by a A-DCCF. ADAE server can send requests for data to the A-DCCF rather than directly to the Data Sources. A-DCCF may also perform data processing/abstraction and data preparation based on the VAL server requirements.\n-\tApplication layer – Analytics and Data Repository Function (A-ADRF) stores historical data and/or analytics, i.e., data and/or analytics related to past time period that has been obtained by the consumer (e.g. ADAE server). After the consumer obtains data and/or analytics, consumer may store historical data and/or analytics in an A-ADRF. Whether the consumer directly contacts the A-ADRF or goes via the A-DCCF is based on configuration.\nFigure 5.3-1 illustrates the generic functional model for ADAE when re-using the 3GPP network data analytics model.\nFigure 5.3-1: ADAE internal functional architecture\nIn this model, an A-DCCF is used to fetch data or put data into an application-level entity (e.g. A-ADRF, Data Source). Such A-DCCF coordinates the collection and distribution of data requested by ADAE server (over ADCCF-1, ADAE-X). ADAE server can also directly interact with the Data Sources via ADAE-Y.\nAlso, Application layer – Analytics and Data Repository Function (A-ADRF) can be used to store historical data and/or analytics, i.e., data and/or analytics related to past time period that has been obtained by the ADAE server (via AADRF-1) or other NFs/NWDAF. ADAE server can also fetch historical data from A-ADRF. Whether the ADAE server directly contacts the A-ADRF or goes via the A-DCCF is based on configuration.\nData Sources can be 5GS data sources (5GC, OAM) or enablement layer data sources (SEAL, EEL) or external data sources at the DN side (VAL server/ EAS) and VAL UEs.  A-DCCF and A-ADRF can be used only for interacting with certain data sources (e.g., 5GC, OAM) based on configuration, and can be hidden from the VAL layer.\nNOTE:\tIf the Data Source is the VAL UE, then the data collection mechanism shall reuse the SA4 mechanism based on EVEX study (TS 26.531 [3]).",

Such requests may be towards:\n-\tOAM for providing PM data related to the requested slice / NSI. Alternatively, if the interaction to OAM happens via NSCE layer (see TS 23.435 [6]), such subscription can be performed to NSCE (where ADAES is acting as VAL server).\n-\tNWDAF for providing slice related analytics for the given area and time horizon (indicated in step 1). Such analytics can be the slice load level related network data analytics, or the service experience related network data analytics for a given slice\n4.\tThe ADAES based on subscription, receives PM data notification from OAM or from NSCE server (via OAM APIs or NSCE-S APIs)\n5.\tThe ADAES based on subscription, receives the requested NWDAF analytics outputs. Such analytics can be:\n-\tnetwork slice or NSI statistics or predictions (clause 6.3.3A of TS 23.288 [4])\n-\tper slice instance service experience stats or predictions (clause 6.4.3 of TS 23.288 [4])\n6.\tThe ADAES can also provide analytics on the VAL session performance (based on the procedure of clause 8.2.2 step 11 or clause 8.2.3 step 12) and filters the analytics only for the sessions which are connected to that requested slice for the area of interest.\n7.\tThe ADAES abstracts or correlates the data/analytics from steps 4-6 and provides analytics on the slice or NSI performance for the target VAL application/server. For example, such analytics can be about the min/average/max predicted RTT / end to end latency for the VAL application/server if this server uses a given slice/NSI (or for a list of given slices) within an area of interest.\n8.\tThe ADAES sends the analytics to the consumer, as a slice-specific performance analytics notification message.",

      "content": "Figure 8.6.2-1 illustrates the procedure for service API analytics enablement solution.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tADAES acts as API management function in CAPIF\nFigure 8.6.2 -1: Service API analytics procedure\n1.\tThe VAL server sends a service API event subscription request to the ADAE server to receive analytics for one or more service APIs.\n2. Upon receiving the event subscription request from the subscribing entity, the ADAE server checks for the relevant authorization for the event subscription. If the authorization is successful, the ADAE server stores the subscription information.\n3.\tThe ADAE server sends a service API event subscription response indicating successful subscription\n4.\tUpon sending the subscription response, the ADAE server requests to collect API logs to be used to derive analytics and triggers API invocation log pull request towards the CAPIF core function. The API invocation log fetch request indicates the API (or list of APIs) for which logs are required. Based on the ADAE server deployment, this can be a Query service API log request which is performed via CAPIF_Auditing API as specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [8].\n5.\tThe CCF authorizes the request and fetches the API logs from the storage unit. CCF then sends the requested information to the ADAE server via a query service API log response.\n6.\tThe ADAES may also request service API historical analytics /data from A-ADRF for the corresponding service APIs.\n7.\tBased on the request, the ADAES receives historical analytics/data for the service APIs from the A-ADRF.\n8.\tThe ADAE server authorizes and anonymizes the API logs (if not performed by CCF) and abstracts based on exposure level. The exposure level can be known based on pre-configuration by the OAM or based on the subscription and type of invoker. The ADAE server then derives analytics on the target service API(s) based on the logs received from the CCF. Such analytics are predictions/stats for the API status based on the analytics event.\n9.\tThe ADAE server sends the analytics as event notifications to all the subscribing entities that have subscribed for the event matching the criteria. If a notification reception information is available as part of the subscribing entity event subscription, then the notification reception information is used by the ADAE server to send event notifications to the subscribing entity.",

Such data can be measurements or analytics based on the data source/producer, as follows:\n-\tfrom OAM or EAS/ASP (for EAS load info): Per EAS/EES computational resource load, number of connections per EES/EAS\n-\tfrom N6 endpoint: N6 load\n-\tfrom 5GC / NWDAF: DN performance analytics\n-\tfrom OAM / MDAS: UPF load analytics (per DNAI)\n-\tfrom MEC platform services (e.g., RNIS): per cell radio conditions / load for all cells within EDN coverage\nNOTE 1: How the ADAES obtains the EAS load information from EAS/ASP is up to implementation.\nNOTE 2: Steps 6 and 7 are not necessarily sequential and can be performed in parallel or in different order.\n8.\tIf in step 4 ADAES sent a subscription request to ADAEC as Data Producer, data collection is initiated by ADAEC from UE data generating entities.\nNOTE 3:\tData collection at the UE reuses the SA4 mechanism based on EVEX study (TS 26.531 [3]).\n9.\tThe edge Data Producers (targets of the subscription requests in step 4) send the data to the ADAES (based on step 7 measurements or analytics) as a data notification message. Such data can be about the load in terms of number of EAS or EES connections for a given area or time window, or the average edge computational resource usage or usage ratio based on the EDN total resource availability, EDN overload/high load indication events, probability of EAS/EES unavailability due to high load, etc.\n10.\t ADAEC sends data (periodically or if a threshold is reached based on configuration) about the edge load as collected at the UE, e.g. in terms of number of AC or EEC connections for a given UE in a given time window, number of edge service sessions, etc.\n11.\tThe ADAES derives edge analytics on EDN / DNAI load or per EES/EAS load, based on the analytics ID and type of request. The analytics are derived based on the performance analytics received per DN or load analytics per DNAI/UPF; as well as considering measurements on the computational or RAN resource load or number of connections for the EES/EASs which are active at the EDN.\n12.\tThe ADAES sends the edge analytics to the consumer, based on the request and the derived analytics in step 9. Such analytics indicate a prediction of the EDN load considering inputs from both 5GS as well as from edge platform services. Such prediction can also be in form of a recommendation for triggering an EAS relocation to a different platform.",

There could be three deployment options:\n-\tADAES can be deployed at a centralized cloud platform, and collects data from multiple EDNs\n-\tADAES can be deployed at the edge platform\n-\tCoordinated ADAES deployment, where multiple ADAE services are deployed in edge or central clouds. Such deployment allows for local-global analytics for system wide optimization\nA.2\tDeployment model #1: Cloud-deployed ADAES\nIn this deployment, as shown in Figure A.2-1, the ADAES is centrally located and can provide analytics services to different consumers including, edge servers, VAL servers, as well as to other SEAL servers (e.g. NSCE).\nThe statistics/predictions that the ADAES provides are applicable to the ADAES service area, which can be provided for the entire PLMN.\nFigure A.2-1: Cloud deployed ADAES\nA.3\tDeployment model #2 Edge-deployed ADAES\nIn this deployment, as shown in Figure A.3-1, the ADAES is located at the EDN and provides analytics services to the EAS and EES at the edge platform. ADAES can be deployed by the ECSP or the MNO to provide analytics for the application or edge parameters.\nThe statistics/predictions that the edge deployed ADAES are applicable to the ADAES service areas (as shown in the example in Fig A.2-2), which are equivalent to the EES/EAS service areas. Such analytics can be about the edge load or the EAS performance and can be provided to consumers within EDN.\nIn this deployment the interaction between edge deployed ADAES is possible for exchanging edge/application analytics for application mobility scenarios or for cases when ADAES #1 and #2 service areas have overlapping coverage.\nFigure A.3-1: Edge deployed ADAES\nA.4\tDeployment model #3: Coordinated ADAES deployment\nIn this deployment, multiple ADAESs can be located at different EDNs/DNs and can be deployed by the same ADAE provider.  Such coordinated deployments allow the local – global analytics derivation (which may be needed for improving the analytics confidence level). The centrally deployed ADAES can also act as ADAE analytics aggregator entity and configures the edge deployed ADAES to derive analytics on different sub-areas.\nOne example is the use of analytics for the EDN#1 or EDN#2 load which will help predicting the VAL server performance at a centrally located ADAES. Such deployment is also applicable for ML-based analytics methods, like supervised learning, where the centrally located ADAES acts as ML model training entity, and the edge located ADAESs can act as ML model inference entities (using edge data to improve the prediction accuracy).\nThe statistics/predictions that the edge deployed ADAES correspond to the ADAES service areas (as shown in the example in Fig A.4-1), which is equivalent to the EES/EAS service areas. The central ADAE server covers all PLMN area and is used to coordinate or jointly perform analytics with the distributed ADAES. Such analytics services can be provided to consumers at the central DN, like the VAL servers or SEAL services or even at the PLMN side (e.g. NWDAF consuming service experience analytics).\nFigure A.4-1: Coordinated deployment of ADAES\nAnnex B (informative):Change history\nChange history\nDate\nMeeting\nTDoc\nCR\nRev\nCat\nSubject/Comment\nNew version\n2022-10\nSA6#51-e\nTS skeleton\n0.0.0\n2022-10\nSA6#51-e\nImplementation of the following pCRs approved by SA6:\nS6-222940, S6-222941, S6-222942, S6-222943\n0.1.0\n2022-11\nSA6#52\nImplementation of the following pCRs approved by SA6: S6-223235, S6-223237, S6-223455, S6-223456, S6-223494\n0.2.0\n2023-01\nSA6#52-bis-e\nImplementation of the following pCRs approved by SA6: S6-230262, S6-230363, S6-230247\n0.3.0\n2023-03\nSA6#53\nImplementation of the following pCRs approved by SA6:\nS6-230939, S6-230847, S6-230848, S6-230849, S6-230850\n0.4.0\n2023-03\nSA#99\nSP-230273\nPresentation for information at SA#99\n1.0.0\n2023-04\nSA6#54-e\nImplementation of the following pCRs approved by SA6:\nS6-231484, S6-231543, S6-231502, S6-231435, S6-231641, S6-231257, S6-231261, S6-231270.\n1.1.0\n2023-05\nSA6#55\nImplementation of the following pCRs approved by SA6:\nS6-231690, S6-232085, S6-232091.\n1.2.0\n2023-06\nSA#100\nSP-230687\nPresentation for approval at SA#100\n2.0.0\n2023-06\nSA#100\nSP-230687\nMCC Editorial update for publication after TSG SA approval (SA#100)\n18.0.0\n2023-09\nSA#101\nSP-230996\n0001\n3\nF\nUpdates to Procedure on Service experience\n18.1.0\n2023-09\nSA#101\nSP-230996\n0002\nF\nAdding missing A-ADRF API\n18.1.0\n2023-12\nSA#102\nSP-231544\n0004\n4\nF\nExtend the edge performance analytics to support transmission quality analytics\n18.2.0\n2023-12\nSA#102\nSP-231544\n0005\n1\nF\nUpdates to Procedure on support for application performance analytics\n18.2.0\n2023-12\nSA#102\nSP-231544\n0006\nF\nUpdates to Procedure on support for slice-specific application performance analytics\n18.2.0\n2023-12\nSA#102\nSP-231544\n0007\n2\nF\nUpdates to Procedure on support for UE-to-UE application performance analytics\n18.2.0\n2023-12\nSA#102\nSP-231544\n0008\nF\nUpdates to Procedure on support for location accuracy analytics\n18.2.0\n2023-12\nSA#102\nSP-231544\n0009\nF\nUpdates to Procedure for supporting service API analytics\n18.2.0\n2023-12\nSA#102\nSP-231544\n0010\nF\nUpdates to Slice usage pattern analytics\n18.2.0\n2023-12\nSA#102\nSP-231544\n0011\nF\nUpdates to Procedure for supporting edge load analytics\n18.2.0\n2023-12\nSA#102\nSP-231544\n0012\n3\nF\nClarification on parameter of the analytics request\n18.2.0\n2023-12\nSA#102\nSP-231544\n0014\n1\nF\nClarification and correction for edge load analytics\n18.2.0\n2024-03\nSA#103\nSP-240300\n0015\nF\nCorrect edge load analytics\n18.3.0\n2024-03\nSA#103\nSP-240300\n0016\nF\nCorrect registration\n18.3.0\n2024-03\nSA#103\nSP-240300\n0020\n1\nF\nUpdates to Application Performance Analytics and API\n18.3.0\n2024-03\nSA#103\nSP-240300\n0021\n2\nF\nUpdates to Slice-specific Application Performance Analytics and API\n18.3.0\n2024-03\nSA#103\nSP-240300\n0022\n2\nF\nUpdates to UE-to-UE Application Performance Analytics and API\n18.3.0\n2024-03\nSA#103\nSP-240300\n0023\n1\nF\nUpdates to Location Accuracy Analytics and API\n18.3.0\n2024-03\nSA#103\nSP-240300\n0024\n2\nF\nUpdates to Service API Analytics and API\n18.3.0\n2024-03\nSA#103\nSP-240300\n0025\n2\nF\nUpdates to Slice Usage Pattern Analytics and API\n18.3.0\n2024-03\nSA#103\nSP-240300\n0026\n1\nF\nUpdates to Edge Load Analytics and API\n18.3.0\n2024-06\nSA#104\nSP-240300\n0029\n2\nF\nAddition of functional entities and reference points\n18.4.0\n2024-09\nSA#105\nSP-241211\n0035\n1\nF\nAlignment with SA4 and CT1\n18.5.0\n2024-12\nSA#106\nSP-241705\n0041\nF\nEN resolution in clause 8.9.1\n18.6.0",
