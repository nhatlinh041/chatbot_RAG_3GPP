It consists of OpenAPI 3.0.0 specifications in YAML format.\nThis Annex takes precedence when being discrepant to other parts of the specification with respect to the encoding of information elements and methods within the API(s).\nNOTE 1:\tThe semantics and procedures, as well as conditions, e.g. for the applicability and allowed combinations of attributes or values, not expressed in the OpenAPI definitions but defined in other parts of the specification also apply.\nInformative copies of the OpenAPI specification files contained in this 3GPP Technical Specification are available on a Git-based repository that uses the GitLab software version control system (see clause 5.3.1 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [6] and clause 5B of 3GPP TR 21.900 [14]).\nA.2\tN5g-ddnmf_Discovery API\nopenapi:
