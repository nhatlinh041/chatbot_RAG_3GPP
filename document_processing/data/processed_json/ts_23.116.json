      "content": "The cancel location procedures are normally not used within and between Super-Charged networks as part of the location update procedure, as described 3GPP TS 23.012. However, Super-Charged networks shall support the cancel location procedure to provide interworking for location update procedures with GSM & UMTS networks that do not support the Super-Charger functionality. The cancel location procedure shall also be used within a Super-Charged network as a notification when there is a need to inform the previous network entity that the connections for the subscriber can be released, due to the fact that the MS has moved to another network entity. Subscription data should still be kept in the previous network entities that support Super-Charger.\nThe mechanisms used to determine which network entities the cancel location message shall be sent to are outside the scope of this specification. However, it is recommended that the HLR store an indication if the serving network entity supports the Super-Charger functionality. It is also recommended that an HLR supporting the Super-Charger functionality have mechanisms to decide when a notification as described above needs to be sent against previous network entity or not. Without such mechanisms, Cancel Location shall always be sent. The mechanisms are triggered by the indication received from serving network entity during location update procedure saying that previous network entity must be notified. These mechanisms are triggered when there is a risk data inconsistency between nodes in the network, and are detailed in 3GPP TS 23.912.\nAn HLR supporting the mobile terminating roaming forwarding feature (see 3GPP TS 23.018 [10]) shall always send a MAP Cancel Location message to the old VLR upon receipt of the MAP Update Location from the new VLR.
