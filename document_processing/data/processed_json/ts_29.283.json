The resolution mechanism is not required in networks that utilise a single MC Service User Database per MC Service or when an MC Service Server is configured to use pre-defined MC Service User Database.\nThe resolution mechanism shall use a Diameter Proxy Agent or a Diameter Redirect Agent.\nThe Diameter Proxy Agent or Diameter Redirect Agent shall be used to determine the MC Service User Database identity.\nIn networks where the use of the MC Service ID to MCPTT User Database resolution mechanism is required and the MC Server Server is not configured to use a predefined MC Service User Database, each MC Service Server shall be configured with the pre-configured address/name of a Diameter Proxy Agent or Diameter Redirect Agent to enable use of these resolution mechanisms.\nTo get the MC Service User Database identity, the MC Service Server or the Configuration Management Server shall send the Data Management Application request normally destined to the MC Service User Database to the pre-configured Diameter Proxy Agent or Diameter Redirect Agent.\nThe Diameter Proxy Agent shall determine the MC Service User Database identity based on the provided user identity and - if the Diameter load control mechanism is supported (see IETF RFC 8583 [17]) - optionally also based on previously received load values from Load AVPs of type HOST.

This error code is defined in 3GPP TS 29.329 [9].\nAnnex A (normative):Diameter overload control mechanism\nA.1\tGeneral\nDiameter overload control mechanism is an optional feature.\nIETF RFC 7683 [11] specifies a Diameter overload control mechanism which includes the definition and the transfer of related AVPs between Diameter nodes.\nIt is recommended to make use of IETF RFC 7683 [11] on the MCPTT-2, MCVideo-2, MCData-2 and CSC-13 interfaces where, when applied, the MC Service Server and the Configuration Management Server shall behave as a reacting node and the MC Service User Database as a reporting node.\nDepending on regional/national requirements and network operator policy, priority traffic (e.g. MCPTT emergency call) shall be exempted from throttling due to Diameter overload control up to the point where requested traffic reduction cannot be achieved without throttling the priority traffic.\nA.2\tMC Service User Database behaviour\nThe MC Service User Database requests traffic reduction from the MC Service Server when the MC Service User Database is in an overload situation, including OC-OLR AVP in answer commands as described in IETF RFC 7683 [11].\nThe MC Service User Database identifies that it is in an overload situation by implementation specific means. For example, the MC Service User Database may take into account the traffic over the MC Service Server to MC Service User Database interfaces (e.g. MCPTT-2) or other interfaces, the level of usage of internal resources (CPU, memory), the access to external resources, etc.\nThe MC Service User Database determines the specific contents of OC-OLR AVP in overload reports and the MC Service User Database decides when to send OC-OLR AVPs by implementation specific means.\nA.3\tMC Service Server and Configuration Management Server behaviour\nThe MC Service Server and the Configuration Management Server apply required traffic reduction received in answer commands to subsequent applicable requests, as per IETF RFC 7683 [11].\nThe MC Service Server and the Configuration Management Server achieve requested traffic reduction by implementation specific means. For example, the MC Service Server or the Configuration Management Server may implement message throttling with prioritization or a message retaining mechanism for operations that can be postponed.\nDiameter requests related to priority traffic (e.g., MCPTT emergency call), detected via the presence of priority information (e.g., Resource-Priority header field for MPS) in SIP messages as described in 3GPP TS 24.229 [13], have the highest priority. Depending on regional/national requirements and network operator policy, these Diameter requests shall be the last to be throttled, when the MC Service Server has to apply traffic reduction.\nAnnex B (Informative):Diameter overload node behaviour\nB.1\tMessage prioritization\nThis clause describes possible behaviours of the MC Service Server and the Configuration Management Server regarding message prioritization in an informative purpose.\nThe MC Service Server may take the following into account when making throttling decisions:\n-\tIdentification of the procedures that can be deferred, so to avoid to drop non deferrable procedures;\n-\tPrioritization of certain types of request (e.g. between NDR and DPR) according to the context of their use, in particular:\n-\tLower prioritization of commands for MC Service Server that are related to massive subscription data update due to provisioning.\n-\tPriority level of a priority user.\nThe Configuration Management Server may take the following into account when making throttling decisions:\n-\tIdentification of the procedures that can be deferred (e.g. Update of the MCPTT User Profile in the MCPTT database), so to avoid to drop non deferrable procedures;\n-\tPrioritization of certain types of request (e.g. between NDR and DPR) according to the context of their use, in particular:\n-\tLower prioritization of commands for the Configuration Management Server that are related to massive subscription data update due to provisioning.\n-\tPriority level of a priority user.\nAnnex C (normative):Diameter message priority mechanism\nC.1\tGeneral\nIETF RFC 7944 [8] specifies a Diameter message priority mechanism that allows Diameter nodes to indicate the relative priority of Diameter messages. With this information, other Diameter nodes may leverage the relative priority of Diameter messages into routing, resource allocation, set the DSCP marking for transport of the associated Diameter message, and also abatement decisions when overload control is applied.\nC.2\tMCPTT-2, MCVideo-2, MCData-2 and CSC-13 interfaces\nC.2.1\tGeneral\nThe Diameter message priority mechanism is an optional feature.\nIt is recommended to make use of IETF RFC 7944 [8] over the MCPTT-2, MCVideo-2, MCData-2 and CSC-13 interfaces of an operator network when the overload control defined in Annex A is applied on these interfaces.\nC.2.2\tMC Service Server and Configuration Management Server behaviour\nWhen the MCPTT Server or the Configuration Management Server support the Diameter message priority mechanism, the MCPTT Server or the Configuration Management Server shall comply with IETF RFC 7944 [8].\nThe MCPTT Server or the Configuration Management Server sending a request shall determine the required priority according to its policies. When priority is required, the MCPTT Server or the Configuration Management Server shall include the DRMP AVP indicating the required priority level in the request it sends and shall prioritise the request according to the required priority level.\nWhen the MCPTT Server or the Configuration Management Server receives the corresponding response, it shall prioritise the received response according to the priority level received within the DRMP AVP if present, in the response, otherwise according to the priority level of the corresponding request.\nWhen the MCPTT Server or the Configuration Management Server receives a request, it shall handle the request according to the received DRMP AVP priority level. For the response, the MCPTT Server or the Configuration Management Server may modify the priority level received in the DRMP AVP according to its policies and shall handle the response according to the required priority level. If the required priority level is different from the priority level received in the request, the MCPTT Server or the Configuration Management Server shall include the DRMP AVP in the response.\nIf:\n-\tthe MCPTT Server and the Configuration Management Server supports using the Diameter message priority mechanism for DSCP marking purposes,\n-\tthe transport network utilizes DSCP marking, and\n-\tmessage-dependant DSCP marking is possible for the protocol stack transporting Diameter,\nthen the MCPTT Server and the Configuration Management Server shall set the DSCP marking for transport of the request or response according to the required priority level.\nDiameter requests related to priority traffic (e.g. MCPTT emergency call) shall contain a DRMP AVP with a high priority of which the level value is operator dependent.\nWhen not-explicitly requested, the inclusion and priority value of the DRMP AVP in Diameter messages are implementation specific.\nC.2.3\tMC Service User Database behaviour\nWhen the MCPTT User Database supports the Diameter message priority mechanism, the MCPTT User Database shall comply with IETF RFC 7944 [8].\nThe MCPTT User Database sending a request shall determine the required priority according to its policies. When priority is required, the MCPTT User Database shall include the DRMP AVP indicating the required priority level in the request it sends, and shall prioritise the requests according to required priority level.\nWhen the MCPTT User Database receives the corresponding response, it shall prioritise the received response according to the priority level received within the DRMP AVP if present in the response, otherwise according to the priority level of the corresponding request.\nWhen the MCPTT User Database receives a request, it shall handle the request according to the received DRMP AVP priority level. For the response, it may modify the priority level received in the DRMP AVP according to its policies and shall handle the response according to the required priority level. If the required priority level is different from the priority level received in the request, it shall include the DRMP AVP in the response.\nIf:\n-\tthe MCPTT User Database supports using the Diameter message priority mechanism for DSCP marking purposes,\n-\tthe transport network utilizes DSCP marking, and\n-\tmessage-dependant DSCP marking is possible for the protocol stack transporting Diameter,\nthen the MCPTT User Database shall set the DSCP marking for transport of the request or response according to the required priority level.\nWhen not explicitly requested, the inclusion and priority value of the DRMP AVP in Diameter messages are implementation specific.\nAnnex D (normative):Diameter load control mechanism\nD.1\tGeneral\nDiameter load control mechanism is an optional feature.\nIt is recommended to make use of IETF RFC 8583 [17] on the MCPTT-2, MCVideo-2, MCData-2 and CSC-13 interfaces where, when applied, the MC Service Server and the Configuration Management Server shall behave as reacting nodes and the MC Service User Database as a reporting node.\nD.2\tMC Service User Database behaviour\nThe MC Service User Database may report its current load by including a Load AVP of type HOST in answer commands as described in IETF RFC 8583 [17].\nThe MC Service User Database calculates its current load by implementation specific means. For example, the MC Service User Database may take into account the traffic over the MCPTT-2, MCVideo-2, MCData-2 and CSC-13 interfaces or other interfaces, the level of usage of internal resources (e.g. CPU, memory), the access to external resources, etc.\nThe MC Service User Database determines when to send Load AVPs of type HOST by implementation specific means.\nD.3\tMC Service Server and Configuration Management Server behaviour\nWhen performing next hop Diameter Agent selection for requests that are routed based on realm, the MC Service Server/Configuration Management Server may take into account load values from Load AVPs of type PEER received from candidate next hop Diameter nodes, as per IETF RFC 8583 [17].\nAnnex E (informative):Change history\nChange history\nDate\nMeeting\nTDoc\nCR\nRev\nCat\nSubject/Comment\nNew version\nFeb 2016\nCT4#72\nC4-161515\nCreation\n0.1.0\nFeb 2016\nCT4#72\nC4-161516\nVersion after Ct4#72\n0.2.0\nMar 2016\nCT#71\nCP-160120\nPresented for information and approval\n1.0.0\nMar 2016\nCT#71\nCP-160162\nTS number added and Approved\n1.0.1\nMar 2016\nCT#71\nVersion 13.0.0 created after CT plenary\n13.0.0\nJun 2016\nCT#72\nCP-160227\n0001\n2\nEnhancements to MCPTT-2 and CSC-13\n13.1.0\nJun 2016\nCT#72\nCP-160227\n0002\n2\nIANA assigned application Id and command code values\n13.1.0\n2016-12\nCT#74\nCP-160664\n0006\n-\nCorrection to change IETF drmp draft version to official RFC 7944\n13.2.0\n2016-12\nCT#74\nCP-160681\n0005\n1\nLoad Control\n14.0.0\n2017-03\nCT#75\nCP-170045\n0007\n1\nSupport of MCVideo and MCData Services\n14.1.0\n2017-03\nCT#75\nCP-170048\n0010\n1\nUpdate of reference for the Diameter base protocol\n14.1.0\n2017-03\nCT#75\nCP-170048\n0011\n1\nHandling of the Vendor-Specific-Application-Id AVP\n14.1.0\n2017-06\nCT#76\nCP-171022\n0013\n-\nVendor-Specific-Application-Id\n14.2.0\n2017-06\nCT#76\nCP-171018\n0015\n1\nSupport for signaling transport level packet marking\n14.2.0\n2017-09\nCT#77\nCP-172013\n0017\n-\nCorrection of DRMP Procedures\n14.3.0\n2018-06\nCT#80\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-15 version (MCC)\n15.0.0\n2019-09\nCT#85\nCP-192094\n0019\n2\ndraft-ietf-dime-load published as RFC 8583\n15.1.0\n2020-07\nCT#88e\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-16 version (MCC)\n16.0.0\n2022-04\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-17 version (MCC)\n17.0.0\n2022-12\nCT#98e\nCP-223075\n0025\n-\nA\nData Pull improvement\n17.1.0\n2024-03\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-18 version (MCC)\n18.0.0",
