      "content": "This \"Idle-Mode Redial\" mechanism is a combination of existing Voice call and Video call standards and services. It is a \"terminal-centric\" solution that requires only minimal additional support from the UTRAN, GERAN and Core Network. There are 3 main components to the solution:\na)\tSwitching between voice and video during an established call is achieved by one UE releasing the voice (or video) call and then that UE establishing a video (or voice) call with the same destination UE.\nb)\tDuring a video call, the radio coverage at one end may degrade such that the video call cannot be maintained. In this case the video call will be released, and, the UE that initiated the video call can offer to its user an attempt to establish a voice call with the other party.\nc)\tThe initial establishment of a video call may be unsuccessful, in which case the A party can automatically establish a voice call.\nFor all these 3 cases, optimisation of the Man Machine Interface in the UE is possible and desirable.\nNOTE:\tThere may be tradeoffs between 'speed of redial' and interactions with content servers that only support video calls. In particular, the use of the term \"automatic\" does not prevent the UE requesting confirmation from the user.\nIt is not the intention of this TR to specify the MMI of UEs, however, this TR does describe some MMI actions solely for the purpose of easing the description of the procedures.",

      "content": "The successful case of the \"B party initiated switch to video\" for UMTS is illustrated in Figure 1. The notation \"UE 1\" and \"UE 2\" is used (rather than A and B party) because, if the B party (of the voice call) presses the \"switch to video\" button, it then becomes the A party of the subsequent video call.\nFigure 1: B party initiated switch to video\n0)\tThe UEs are in a voice call initiated by UE 1. Following verbal dialogue between User 1 and User 2, they agree that a switch to video is likely to be successful (e.g. because both User 1 and User 2 have video capable handsets, and, they both have \"using 3G\" indications visible on their screens). The User of UE 2 pushes the \"switch to video\" button (or uses other MMI that provides the same functionality) and UE 2 stores the CLI of UE 1 for use in step 7.\nNOTE 1:\tIf UE 1 (instead of UE 2) initiated the \"switch to video\", then UE 1 stores the previously dialled number for use in step 7.\n1)\tUE 2 releases the voice call.\n2)\tMSC 2 sends a RELEASE message with the release cause. The cause value in the RELEASE message might be changed by transit networks prior to arrival at MSC 1.\n3)\tMSC 1 sends a RELEASE COMPLETE message to MSC 2.\n4)\tMSC 1 releases the voice call with UE 1.\n5)\tMSC 2 and MSC 1 locally release the Iu connections to RNC 2 and RNC 1 (assuming that there are no other CM connections active). RNC 2 and RNC 1 then release the RRC connections (assuming that their mobiles are not in PMM connected state).\nIn order to minimise idle tasks performed by the UE, the following should be performed by Operators which preferentially camp UEs on UMTS:\nthe BSC should include the \"Cell selection indicator after release of all TCH and SDCCH\" IE in the Channel Release message (see TS 44.018 [2]) if the release is done on a GERAN cell and the call was not started on this BSC and the local 2G and 3G cells are in different RAs.\nNOTE 2:\tThe above text does mean RA. Change of LA always involves change of RA.\n6)\tUE 2 and UE 1 camp on suitable cells and perform the required idle mode tasks.\n7)\tUE 2 initiates RRC connection setup and sends the Setup message for the video call to MSC 2. The Called Party number is the one stored in step 0. The Setup message should carry extra information to indicate that it is the result of a redial attempt.\n8)\tMSC 2 requests the allocation of radio resources.\nIf the GERAN does not support CS video, then the MSC 2 shall send an A interface Assignment Request message to the BSC including the Service Handover IE set to \"Handover to UTRAN or cdma2000 should be performed\" and a Channel Type indicating any value acceptable to the BSC. The BSS handles the Assignment Request message as defined in TS 48.008 [3]. The interactions between MSC server and MGW can be minimised if the A interface circuit is not allocated. This can be achieved by setting the Channel Type = signalling. The interactions between the MSC server and the MGW are defined in TS 23.205 [12].\nIf the GERAN does support CS video then the MSC 2 should send an A interface Assignment Request message to the BSC including the relevant channel type. The BSS proceeds as defined in TS 48.008 [3].\n9)\tIf radio resource allocation was successful, the IAM message is sent to MSC 1 and the Call Proceeding message is sent to UE 2.\n10)\tMSC 1 pages UE 1. UE 1 responds by establishing an RRC connection and sending the Paging Response message to MSC 1 within the RRC-Initial Direct Transfer and RANAP-Initial UE messages. MSC 1 then sends the Setup message for the video call to UE 1. The Setup message carries the CLI of UE 2.\n11) UE 1 confirms its capability to handle the video call in the Call Confirmed message and MSC 1 requests the allocation of radio resources.\nIf UE 1 responded to paging by establishing an RR connection on a GERAN cell, then MSC 1 initiates handover to UTRAN as described in step 8.\n12)\tIf the radio resource allocation was successful, UE 1 sends an Alerting message to MSC 1. MSC 1 sends the ACM message to MSC 2 and MSC 2 sends the Alerting message to UE 2.\n13)\tUser 1 answers the video call. For privacy reasons, the \"switch to video\" and \"switch to voice\" answer functions should not be automated.\n14)\tThe video call is established.\nWith obvious small differences, some of which are described above, the above procedure is also used for switching from a video call to a voice call.\nNOTE 3:\tWhen \"redial-switching\" from a video call to a voice call, the voice call Setup message should carry the extra information to indicate that it is a redial attempt.",

      "content": "The procedure in 4.3.1.1 can also be used if UE 2 drops out of UTRAN coverage into GERAN coverage. However there are additional complications:\na)\tIf the UTRAN and GERAN cells are attached to different MSCs then problems are likely to occur due to the time required for the UE 2 to perform Location Area and Routeing Area updating.\nIn particular, if UE 2 is updating with a new MSC and/or new SGSN, UE 2 will not respond to MSC 2's paging. This will only become known to UE 1 when MSC 2's \"no response to paging\" timer expires. Typically, an operator configures this timer with values in the range of 8 to 25 seconds. When this timer expires, it is quite likely that UE 2 will have \"call forward on not reachable\" set and so UE 1's call will be diverted to a voice mail server. To avoid these problems, it seems important that the operator configures the UTRAN to minimise the number of video calls that lead to fallback to GERAN coverage and/or to configure the network such that geographically similar UTRAN and GERAN cells are in the same Routeing Area.\nb)\tIn order to avoid useless handover attempts, the RNCs are frequently configured so that no GERAN neighbour cells are given to the mobile during a video call. This will slow down re-selection from 3G to 2G in the case of total loss of 3G coverage. Conversely, in many other scenarios the lack of 2G neighbour cells might force UE 2 to camp on the 3G cell for long enough for it to receive the paging for the voice call.\nOverall, the operator may need to adapt the neighbour cell lists provided in video calls on cell by cell basis and/or dependent upon whether or not combined 2G/3G MSCs AND combined SGSNs are in use.",

In this situation, the original video call establishment has been successful, and, as such, there is no need to \"redial as a voice call\".\nHow the terminating network transfers the established video call to the \"real B party\" is a matter for the terminating network (e.g. with regard to H.324 codec negotiation matters).",

Hence each should be able to use the existing CDR and billing machinery without modification.\nHowever, it is worth noting that the billing system will probably not be able to provide any correlation between video and voice components of the same call.\nThe easy ability to switch between voice and video calls may have an impact on, for example, calculations of 'mean call holding time' if this is calculated from CDRs. As a consequence there may be a need to add extra information onto the CDRs to indicate the reason for release/reason for establishment of a call.\nIn particular, it would be valuable to know the proportion of redial attempts that were successful.\nThe addition of \"reason for establishment\" requires extra TS 24.008 [7] signalling from the mobile. It is recommended that such changes to the TS 24.008 [7] signalling should be made in this release of the specification.\nAn MSC generates call statistics information from its locally available release information.  Some of the abnormal releases on the B party side may be seen only as normal releases on the A party side as some problems of B party side are not signalled between MSCs. Therefore, the probability of the different B party problems has to be taken into account when the statistics for A party side is evaluated.\nAn MSC may collect call statistics information from video calls for:\n-\tunsuccessful mobile originating video call setup because 64 kbit/s RAB is currently not available;\n-\tunsuccessful mobile terminating video call setup because 64 kbit/s RAB is currently not available;\n-\tunsuccessful mobile originating video call setup because of lack of video service support by the UE;\n-\tunsuccessful mobile terminating video call setup because of lack of video service support by the network;\n-\tunsuccessful mobile originating video call setup because UE or network do not support video call;\n-\tdisrupted video calls because of loss of the radio connection;\nand, if TS 24.008 [7] is upgraded, the MSC can collect statistics for:\n-\tthe number of mobile originating video call attempts indicating redial;\n-\tthe number of mobile originating voice call attempts indicating redial.\nAdditionally, it is recommended that a \"redial flag\" is an optional parameter in the CDR produced for Mobile Originated calls as specified in TS 32.205 [9].",
