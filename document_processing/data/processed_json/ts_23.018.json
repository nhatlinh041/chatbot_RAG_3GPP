      "content": "The present document specifies the technical realization of the handling of calls originated by a UMTS or GSM mobile subscriber and calls directed to a UMTS or GSM mobile subscriber, up to the point where the call is established. Normal release of the call after establishment is also specified. Trunk Originated call is also modelled.\nIn the present document, the term MS is used to denote a UMTS UE or GSM MS, as appropriate.\nThe handling of DTMF signalling and Off-Air Call set-up (OACSU) are not described in the present document.\nThe details of the effects of UMTS or GSM supplementary services on the handling of a call are described in the relevant 3GPP TS 23.07x, 3GPP TS 23.08x and 3GPP TS 23.09x series of specifications.\nThe specification of the handling of a request from the HLR for subscriber information is not part of basic call handling, but is required for both CAMEL (3GPP TS 23.078 [12]) and optimal routeing (3GPP TS 23.079 [13]). The use of the Provide Subscriber Information message flow is shown in 3GPP TS 23.078 [12] and 3GPP TS 23.079 [13].\nThe logical separation of the MSC and VLR (shown in clauses 4, 5 and 7), and the messages transferred between them (described in clause 8) are the basis of a model used to define the externally visible behaviour of the MSC/VLR, which is a single physical entity. They do not impose any requirement except the definition of the externally visible behaviour.\nIf there is any conflict between the present document and the corresponding stage 3 specifications (3GPP TS 24.008 [26], 3GPP TS 25.413 [27], 3GPP TS 48.008 [2] and 3GPP TS 29.002 [29]), the stage 3 specification shall prevail.",

If VPLMNB supports GPRS and the Gs interface between VLRB and the SGSN is implemented (see 3GPP TS 23.060 [9]) and there is an association between VLRB and the SGSN for the MS, the paging signal towards the MS goes from VMSCB via VLRB and the SGSN to the BSS. The IPLMN, containing GMSCB, is in principle distinct from HPLMNB, containing HLRB, but the practice for at least the majority of current UMTS or GSM networks is that a call to an MS will be routed to a GMSC in HPLMNB.\nFigure 2: Architecture for a basic mobile terminated call\nWhen GMSCB receives an ISUP IAM, it requests routeing information from HLRB using the MAP protocol. HLRB requests a roaming number from VLRB, also using the MAP protocol, and VLRB returns a roaming number in the Provide Roaming Number Ack. HLRB returns the roaming number to GMSCB in the Send Routeing Info ack. GMSCB uses the roaming number to construct an ISUP IAM, which it sends to VMSCB. When VMSCB receives the IAM, it requests information to handle the incoming call (SIFIC) from VLRB, over an internal interface of the MSC/VLR. If VLRB determines that the incoming call is allowed, it requests VMSCB to page the MS. VMSCB pages the MS using radio interface signalling. When the MS responds, VMSCB informs VLRB in the Page ack message. VLRB instructs VMSCB to connect the call in the Complete call, and VMSCB establishes a traffic channel to the MS.",

This option is not available for a UMTS connection [ffs].\nNOTE 4:\tThe network may request the IMEI from the MS, and may check the IMEI, at any stage during the establishment of an MO call, either as part of the procedure to start security procedures or explicitly after security procedures have started; this is not shown in this message flow diagram.\nFigure 3: Information flow for a basic mobile originated call\nWhen the user wishes to originate a call, MSA establishes a signalling connection with BSSA, and sends a Connection Management (CM) service request to BSSA, which relays it to VMSCA. VMSCA sends a Process Access Request to VLRA. VLRA may then initiate authentication, as described in 3GPP TS 33.102 [32] for UMTS and 3GPP TS 43.020 [1] for GSM. VLRA may also initiate security procedures at this stage, as described in 3GPP TS 33.102 [32] for UMTS 3GPP TS 43.020 [1] for GSM. If the user originates one or more new MO calls in a multicall configuration, MSA sends a CM service request through the existing signalling connection for each new call.\nIf the MS has performed the Connection Management (CM) service request in a CSG cell, VLRA shall control if the CSG cell is allowed by the CSG subscription data stored in VLRA. If the CSG cell is not allowed, VLRA shall reject the Process Access Request.\nIf the MS has performed the Connection Management (CM) service request in a hybrid cell, VLRA shall set the CSG membership status in the Process Access Request ack according to the CSG subscription data stored in VLRA.\nIf VLRA determines that MSA is allowed service, it sends a Process Access Request ack to VMSCA. If VMSCA has received a Start security procedures message from VLRA, the Process Access Request ack message triggers a Start security procedures message towards BSSA; otherwise VMSCA sends a CM Service Accept message towards BSSA.\nIf BSSA receives a Start security procedures message from VMSCA, it initiates security procedures as described in 3GPP TS 33.102 [32] for UMTS and 3GPP TS 43.020 [1] for GSM; when security procedures have been successfully initiated, MSA interprets this in the same way as a CM Service Accept. If security procedures are not required at this stage, BSSA relays the CM Service Accept to MSA.\nWhen MSA has received the CM Service Accept, or security procedures have been successfully initiated, MSA sends a Set-up message containing the B subscriber address via BSSA to VMSCA. MSA also uses the Set-up message to indicate the bearer capability required for the call; VMSCA translates this bearer capability into a basic service, and determines whether an interworking function is required. VMSCA sends to VLRA a request for information to handle the outgoing call, using a Send Info For Outgoing Call (SIFOC) message containing the B subscriber address.\nIf VLRA determines that the call should be connected, it sends a Complete Call message to VMSCA. VMSCA sends a Call Proceeding message via BSSA to MSA, to indicate that the call request has been accepted, and sends an Allocate channel message to BSSA, to trigger BSSA and MSA to set up a traffic channel over the radio interface. The Call Proceeding message includes bearer capability information if any of the negotiable parameters of the bearer capability has to be changed. When the traffic channel assignment process is complete (indicated by the Allocation complete message from BSSA to VMSCA), VMSCA constructs an ISUP IAM using the B subscriber address, and sends it to the destination exchange.\nWhen the destination exchange returns an ISUP Address Complete Message (ACM), VMSCA sends an Alerting message via BSSA to MSA, to indicate to the calling user that the B subscriber is being alerted.\nWhen the destination exchange returns an ISUP ANswer Message (ANM), VMSCA sends a Connect message via BSSA to MSA, to instruct MSA to connect the speech path.\nThe network then waits for the call to be cleared.\nFor an emergency call, a different CM service type (emergency call) is used, and the mobile may identify itself by an IMEI. It is a network operator option whether to allow an emergency call when the mobile identifies itself by an IMEI. Details of the handling are shown in clause 7.",

The paging procedure is described in clause 5.3.\nNOTE 2:\tVMSCB starts the timer for the release of radio resources after it sends the Process Access Request message to VLRB. VMSCB releases the radio resource allocated for the MT call if the timer expires before the IAM is received, and when the MAP RELEASE_RESOURCES message is received from the GMSC.\nNOTE 3:\tIf an ISUP REL message is received at the GMSC between sending of SRI and receiving of SRI ack, the GMSC does not send IAM to the VMSC. Instead a MAP Release_Resources message may be sent to the VMSC.\nFigure 4: Information flow for retrieval of routeing information for a basic mobile terminated call\nWhen GMSCB receives an IAM, it analyses the called party address. If GMSCB can derive an HLR address from the B party address, it sends a request for routeing information (SRI) to HLRB. If GMSCB supports pre-paging (i.e. it is prepared to wait long enough for the SRI ack to allow pre-paging to be completed), it indicates this by an information element in the SRI message.\nHLRB decides whether pre-paging is supported according to the following criteria:\n-\tGMSCB has indicated that it supports pre-paging; and\n-\tHLRB supports pre-paging (i.e. it is prepared to wait long enough for the PRN ack to allow pre-paging to be completed).\nHLRB sends a request for a roaming number (PRN) to VLRB; if pre-paging is supported, it indicates this by an information element in the PRN message. If Paging Area function is supported in HLRB then HLRB sends the paging area if stored in HLR. VLRB returns the roaming number in the PRN ack, and HLRB relays the roaming number to GMSCB in the SRI ack. GMSCB constructs an IAM using the roaming number, and sends it to VMSCB.\nIf the GMSC performs domain selection through HLR interrogation and the HLR supports domain selection functionality, HLRB executes domain selection functionaility. The HLR shall:\n-\tsend PRN to VLRB as defined in this section , if the result of domain selection is to handle the call in CS domain; or\n-\treply with SRI ack without sending PRN to VLRB, if the result of domain selection is to transfer the call from CS domain to IMS domain.",

If MTRF is authorised, the HLR includes the MTRF Supported And Authorized flag and the new MSC/VLR numbers in the MAP Cancel Location message sent to the old VLR. If MTRF is not authorised, the HLR includes the MTRF Supported And Not Authorized flag in the MAP Cancel Location message sent to the old VLR.\n4.\tUpon receipt of a MAP Cancel Location message while on-going paging and if it includes the MTRF Supported And Authorized flag or if the MAP Cancel Location message does include neither the MTRF Supported And Authorized flag nor the MTRF Supported And Not Authorized flag but the old MSC/VLR had received earlier the MTRF Supported flag at step 1, the old MSC/VLR stops paging.\n5.\tIf it supports MTRF and decides to apply MTRF based on local operator policy and optionally roaming agreements with the HLR and new MSC for MTRF, it sends a MAP Provide Roaming Number request (including the MTRF Indicator and the parameters received from the HLR in the MAP Provide Roaming Number) to the new terminating VLR. If the the MAP Cancel Location message does not include the MTRF Supported And Authorized flag and it did not receive the MTRF Supported flag at step 1 or if the MAP Cancel Location message includes the MTRF Supported And Not Authorized flag, the old MSC/VLR may initiate the MT Roaming Retry procedure as per clause 5.2.1.If the old MSC supports both the MT Roaming Retry and the MT Roaming Forwarding procedures, and if the conditions for using these procedures are met, the MSC can decide based on operator policy which procedure to follow.\n6.\tUpon receipt of the MAP Provide Roaming Number Request, the new MSC/VLR may check roaming agreements with the HLR and the old MSC for MTRF.

If available, the old VLR shall include the new LMSI in the MAP Provide Roaming Number message it sends to the new VLR.\nA VLR may also set the MTRF Supported flag in the MAP Update Location message it sends to the HLR upon establishment of an SGs association (see 3GPP TS 23.272 [42]). This enables in particular mobile terminating roaming forwarding calls during the mobile terminated CS service delivery via an alternative MME in MME pool procedure when the new SGs association is established towards a new VLR (see clause 26 of 3GPP TS 23.007 [43]).\nThe information flow for mobile terminating roaming forwarding (MTRF) call if the GSMC and the new MSC/VLR are the same node and if they support the option (in step 6) to deliver the MT call directly to the UE without further involving the old MSC/VLR is shown in figure 4ca.\nFigure 4ca : Information flow for a mobile terminating roaming forwarding call after successful Retrieval of Routeing Information with MTRF Optimal Routing when the GMSC and the new MSC/VLR are the same node\nThe sequence follows the normal flow for MTRF call after successful Retrieval of Routeing Information (as specified in figure 4c) with the following differences:\n1.\tThe GMSC shall include the GMSC address and the Call reference number used by the GMSC for this call in the MAP Send Routing Information . The HLR shall include these parameters in the MAP Provide Roaming Number if received in the MAP Send Routing Information.\n2.\tSteps 1 to 5 as specified for figure 4c.\n3.\tThe new MSC/VLR shall determine that it also performs the GMSC function for the call identified by the Call Reference Number if the GMSC address received in the MAP Provide Roaming Number matches  its own MSC address.\n4.\tIn that case, the GMSC shall send a Release message to the old MSC/VLR. Upon receipt of this message, the old MSC/VLR shall return a Release Complete message to the GMSC.\n5.\tThe new MSC/VLR shall close the MAP Dialogue (initiated in step 3) locally (i.e. MAP-Close service with the release method set to \"pre-arranged end\"). Alternatively, the new MSC/VLR may send a MAP Abort message to the old MSC/VLR  after  receiving the Release Complete message. The old MSC/VLR shall release all resources associated to the call (if not already done at step 4).\nNOTE 5:\tThe MAP Abort message is sent after receipt of the Release Complete message to avoid the old MSC/VLR initiating a Release procedure towards the GMSC or invoking Call Forwarding upon receipt of the MAP Abort message.6.\tThe new MSC/VLR shall then proceed with the establishment of the MT call without further involving the old MSC/VLR.\nNOTE 6:\tThe internal messages between the GMSC and the new MSC/VLR are implementation specific and not further described in 3GPP specifications.",

If this is not so (for the first MT call after VLR restoration), the network may initiate authentication after the MS responds to paging.\nNOTE 4:\tThe network may request the IMEI from the MS, and may check the IMEI, at any stage after the MS responds to paging, either as part of the procedure to start security procedures or explicitly after security procedures have been started; this is not shown in this message flow diagram.\nNOTE 5:\tIf a connection between MSCB and MSB has been established as a result of pre-paging, the paging procedure is not performed.\nNOTE 6:\tIf a connection between MSCB and MSB has been established as a result of pre-paging, VLRB sends the Call arrived message to MSCB to stop the guard timer for the release of the radio connection.\nFigure 5: Information flow for a basic mobile terminated call\nWhen VMSCB receives an IAM from GMSCB it sends to VLRB a request for information to handle the incoming call, using a Send Info For Incoming Call (SIFIC) message containing the roaming number received in the IAM.\nIf VLRB recognizes the roaming number, and MSB is allowed service, it sends a request to VMSCB to page MSB. If a radio connection between the network and MSB is already established, VMSCB responds immediately to the page request. If no radio connection exists, VMSCB sends a page request to BSSB, and BSSB broadcasts the page on the paging channel. If VPLMNB supports GPRS and the Gs interface between VLRB and the SGSN is implemented (see 3GPP TS 23.060 [9]) and there is a valid association between VLRB and the SGSN for the MS, the paging signal towards the MS goes from VMSCB via VLRB and the SGSN to the BSS.\nIf MSB detects the page, it sends a channel request to BSSB, which responds with an immediate assignment command, to instruct MSB to use the specified signalling channel. MSB then sends a page response on the signalling channel; BSSB relays this to VMSCB. VMSCB sends a Process access request message to VLRB to indicate that MSB has responded to paging. VLRB may then initiate authentication, as described in 3GPP TS 33.102 [32] for UMTS and 3GPP TS 43.020 [1] for GSM. VLRB may also initiate security procedures at this stage, as described in 3GPP TS 33.102 [32] for UMTS and 3GPP TS 43.020 [1] for GSM.\nIf the MS is paged in a CSG cell, VLRB shall control if the CSG cell is allowed by the CSG subscription data stored in VLRB. If the CSG cell is not allowed, VLRB shall reject the the Process Access Request.\nIf the MS is paged in a hybrid cell, VLRA shall set the CSG membership status in the Process Access Request ack according to the CSG subscription data stored in VLRA.\nVLRB may restore CSG data from CSS for a MT call after a VLRB restart.\nIf VLRB determines that MSB is allowed service, it sends a Process access request ack to VMSCB. The Process access request ack message triggers a Start security procedures message towards BSSB; if VMSCB has not received a Start security procedures message from VLRB, the Start security procedures message indicates no ciphering.\nVLRB then sends a Complete call message to VMSCB. VMSCB sends a Set-up message towards MSB. The Set-up message may include bearer capability information for the call.\nWhen MSB receives the Set-up message from BSSB, it responds with a Call confirmed message. The Call Confirmed message includes bearer capability information if any of the negotiable parameters of the bearer capability has to be changed. When VMSCB receives the Call confirmed message via BSSB, it sends an Allocate channel message to BSSB. BSSB instructs MSB to tune to a traffic channel by sending an Assignment command. When MSB has tuned to the specified traffic channel it responds with an Assignment complete, message, which BSSB relays to VMSCB as an Allocation complete, and sends an Alerting message to indicate that the called user is being alerted. VMSCB sends an ACM to GMSCB, which relays it to the originating exchange.\nWhen the called user answers, MSB sends a Connect message, which BSSB relays to VMSCB. VMSCB:\n-\tresponds with a Connect ack message towards MSB;\n-\tsends an ANM to GMSCB, which relays it to the originating exchange;\n-\tsends a Complete call ack to VLRB.\nThe network then waits for the call to be cleared.",

Descriptions may be found in the stage 2 specifications for each supplementary service.\nIn the modelling used in the present document, each supplementary service which a network entity supports is managed by a supplementary service handler, which handles data in the entity in which it runs. The call handling processes defined in the present document use the data to define the contents of messages to other entities. The basic call handling processes defined in the present document interact with the supplementary service handlers as shown in the SDL diagrams and the supporting text. If a network entity does not support a supplementary service, it bypasses the interaction with the handler for that supplementary service.

Each protocol defines supervision timers. If a supervision timer expires before a distant entity responds to a signal, the handling is as defined in the appropriate protocol specification. In general, the protocol handler reports timer expiry to the application as an error condition or negative response. Where a timer is shown in the present document, therefore, it is an application timer rather than a protocol timer. Interworking with the protocol handlers uses functional signal names which do not necessarily have a one-to-one correspondence with the names of messages used in the protocols.\nAn MSC which receives an IAM from an originating exchange may react in three different ways:\n-\tIt acts as a transit exchange, i.e. it relays the IAM to a destination exchange determined by analysis of the called party address, and thereafter relays other telephony signalling between the originating and destination exchange until the connection is released. This behaviour is not specific to UMTS or GSM;\n-\tIt acts as a terminating exchange, i.e. it attempts to connect the call to an MS currently registered in the service area of the MSC;\n-\tIt acts as a GMSC, i.e. it interrogates an HLR for information to route the call. If the HLR returns routeing information, the MSC uses the routeing information from the HLR to construct an IAM, which it sends to a destination exchange determined by analysis of the routeing information from the HLR.\nAnnex A describes the method which the MSC uses to decide how to process the IAM.\nThe SDL diagrams in this clause show the handling for a number of optional features and services. If the handling consists only of a call to a procedure specific to the feature or service, the procedure call is omitted if the entity does not support an optional feature or service. If the handling consists of more than a call to a procedure specific to the feature or service, the text associated with each SDL diagram specifies the handling which applies if the entity does not support an optional feature or service. For simplicity of description, it is assumed that support for Operator Determined Barring and the Call Forwarding and Call Barring supplementary services is mandatory.",

The parameter \"Destination address\" is returned by the procedure Obtain_Routeing_Address only if the GMSC supports Optimal Routeing of mobile-to-mobile calls. The Send Routeing Info negative response information element received in the execution of the procedure Obtain_Routeing_Address is global data, available to the parent process.\nSheet 1: the suggested mapping from values of the Send Routeing Info negative response information element to values of the ISUP release cause (see ITU‑T Recommendation Q.850 [37]) is shown in table 1. The mapping used is a matter for the network operator, depending on the telephony signalling system used.\nTable 1: Suggested mapping of Send Routeing Info (SRI)negative responses to ISUP release causes\nSRI negative response\nISUP release cause number\nISUP release cause name\nAbsent subscriber\n20\nSubscriber absent\nBearer service not provisioned\n57\nBearer capability not authorized\nBusy subscriber\n17\nUser busy\nCall barred (ODB)\n21\nCall rejected\nCall barred (SS barring)\n21\nCall rejected\nCall barred (ACR)\n31\nNormal, unspecified (NOTE 2)\nCUG reject (Called party SS interaction violation)\n21\nCall rejected\nCUG reject (Incoming calls barred within CUG)\n55\nIncoming calls barred within CUG\nCUG reject (Subscriber not member of CUG)\n87\nUser not member of CUG\nCUG reject (Requested basic service violates CUG constraints)\n87\nUser not member of CUG\nData missing\n111\nProtocol error, unspecified\nFacility not supported\n69\nRequested facility not implemented\nForwarding violation\n21\nCall rejected\nNumber changed\n22\nNumber changed\nSystem failure\n111\nProtocol error, unspecified\nTeleservice not provisioned\n57\nBearer capability not authorized\nUnexpected data value\n111\nProtocol error, unspecified\nUnknown subscriber\n1\n26\nUnallocated (unassigned) number\nMisrouted call to a ported number (NOTE 1)\nNOTE 1:\tIf the Diagnostic parameter indicates \"NPDB mismatch\", MNP can require a specific ISUP release cause value, according to National Coding Standard, to indicate \"Misrouted call to a ported number\", depending on national regulations. North American GSM Number Portability (NAGNP) requires the SRI negative response \"unknown subscriber\" to be treated differently under certain conditions. If the IAM received from the originating exchange contained the HPLMN routing number for NAGNP then the SRI negative response \"unknown subscriber\" shall be mapped to ISUP release cause number 26 \"Misrouted call to a ported number\"; under all other conditions the SRI negative response \"unknown subscriber\" shall be mapped to ISUP release cause number 1 \"Unallocated (unassigned) number\".\nNOTE 2:\tThe GMSC will play an announcement towards the calling user to signal that the call is rejected due to anonymous call rejection and then include cause 24 \"call rejected due to feature at destination\" in ACM or CPG.

This behaviour is not specific to UMTS or GSM.\n-\tIt acts as a terminating exchange, i.e. it attempts to connect the call to an MS currently registered in the service area of the MSC.\n-\tIt acts as a GMSC, i.e. it interrogates an HLR for information to route the call. If the HLR returns routeing information, the MSC uses the routeing information from the HLR to construct an IAM, which it sends to a destination exchange determined by analysis of the routeing information from the HLR.\nSheet 1: when the MSC co-ordinating setup procedure has decided whether the MSC is to act as a terminating VMSC, a GMSC or a transit exchange, it forwards the IAM to an idle
