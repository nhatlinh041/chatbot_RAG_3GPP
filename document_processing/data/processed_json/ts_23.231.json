The logical architecture for the SIP-I based CS core network is defined in 3GPP TS 23.205 [7].\nThis stage 2 shall cover the information flows between the GMSC server, MSC server and media gateways that are required to support a SIP-I based Nc interface. Note that nothing in the present document shall preclude an implementation of a combined MSC Server and MGW. The present document shall show the CS core network termination of the Iu and A interfaces in order to cover the information flow stimulus to the core network and describe the interaction with the supplementary and value added services and capabilities.\nFor the purposes of the present document, the Nc interface profile is based on ITU-T Q.1912.5 [9] SIP-I profile C and is specified in 3GPP TS 29.231 [4]. The Mc interface profile is based on ITU-T H.248.1 [5] and is specified in 3GPP TS 29.232 [8].\nLocal Call Local Switch (LCLS) functionality is further specified in 3GPP TS 23.284 [31].\nThe present document is applicable only for IP transport in the CS core network.\nDetails of Transcoder-Free Operation/Out of Band Transcoder Control are outside the scope of the present document. See 3GPP TS 23.153 [3] for more information.\nThe present document specifies functions, procedures and information which apply to GERAN Iu mode.

If the succeeding node supports the deferred MGW selection, it should include the identity of the selected MGW in the SDP answer.\nUpon reception of the SDP answer, the (G)MSC Server that initiated the \"deferred MGW\" selection  shall seize a MGW.

The bearer termination T1 is used for the bearer towards the RNC/BSC and the bearer termination T2 is used for the bearer towards the GMSC server selected MGWa. The GMSC server seizes one context with two bearer terminations in MGWa.

In the example the GMSC server requests from MGWa the seizure of the outgoing side bearer termination before forwarding the INVITE to the MSC server. After the outgoing side bearer termination is seized the GMSC server sends the INVITE with supported SDP to the MSC server.  The MSC server requests from MGWb the seizure of the network side bearer termination when Call Confirmed message is received from the UE. The MSC server sends the SDP answer (183 SESSION PROGRESS) to the GMSC. On receipt of the SDP answer, the GMSC requests from MGWa the through connection of the outgoing side bearer termination and the seizure of the incoming side bearer termination. The GMSC server sends the SDP answer (183 SESSION PROGRESS) to the external network. On receipt of the second SDP offer (UPDATE) from the external network, the GMSC server forwards this to the MSC server. The MSC server requests seizure of the access side bearer termination. For a speech call the MSC server requests MGWb to provide a ringing tone to the calling party at alerting. At answer the MSC server requests MGWb to both-way through-connect the bearer. For a speech call the MSC server requests MGWb to stop the ringing tone to the calling party at answer. When the MSC server receives an answer indication, for circuit switched data call it may request the activation of the interworking function in both bearer terminations.

The \"dotted\" line represents the bearer control signalling (not applicable in A/Gb mode for the A-interface) and the bearer. The MSC server seizes one context with two bearer terminations in the MGW. Bearer termination T1 is used for the bearer towards RNC/BSC and bearer termination T2 is used for the bearer towards succeeding MGW.\nFigure 7.2.5.3.1: MGW Initiated Call Clearing (Network model)\nFigure 7.2.5.3.2 shows the message sequence example for the MGW initiated clearing of an established mobile call. After the MSC server is notified that the MGW has released the network side bearer, the MSC server initiates call clearing of the network side and the access side. After the call clearing towards the UE and the radio resource release have been completed the MSC server requests release of the access side bearer termination. Once the preceding/succeeding node has indicated that call clearing has been completed, the MSC server requests the release of the network side bearer termination.\nFigure 7.2.5.3.2: MGW Initiated Call Clearing (message sequence chart)",

Support of the session timer extension procedure is indicated by placing the \"timer\" tag in the Supported header in the INVITE request. The use of session continuity and the session expiration timer value may be negotiated independently between each MSC Server pair. The session refresh request may be either an INVITE request or UPDATE request. The use of the UPDATE request does not require the exchange of SDP and is recommended by RFC 4028 [16].\nWhen a failure of the session continuity is detected, the call will be cleared by the MSC servers independently on either side of the failure point according to the normal call clearing procedures (see clause 7).\nFigure 12.2.2.1 SIP Session Timer",

      "content": "In this example, the procedures for establishing the internal Nb bearer between the peripheral context and the Multiparty bridge context are in accordance with the standard external bearer setup procedures specified for SIP-I based Nc.\nFigure 13.7.6.1 shows the network model for multi party call. The \"squared\" line represents the call control signalling. The \"dotted\" line represents the bearer control signalling and the bearer. Note that for a TDM access there is no separation between the call and bearer control signalling. In the following example it is assumed that each party participating in the Multi Party conference is handled in a separate context representing the call leg between the Multi Party bridge and the Multi Party participant. The Multi Party bridge itself is handled in a separate context. This separation to several contexts is done in order to simplify interactions with other functionality, such as handover, even though other implementation options are not excluded.\nFigure 13.7.6.1: Multi Party call (Network model)\nFor the purposes of the information flow diagrams it is assumed that there are only two remote parties. Party A is the subscriber controlling the Multi Party service (served mobile subscriber). Party B is the held party and party C is the active party.\nIt is assumed that the Multi Party bridge is located in the MGW that has been selected for the served mobile subscriber.\nFigure 13.7.6.2 shows the message sequence example for the beginning of multi party call. When the served mobile subscriber invokes a Multi Party service the MSC server requests the MGW to create a separate context for the Multi Party bridge. The MSC server seizes a bearer termination for each party in that context. In addition, each call leg is represented by a separate context. Therefore the parties in the active call will be split in separate contexts. The MSC server requests the MGW to create a new context and to move the bearer termination for the served mobile subscriber from the active call context to the new context. To connect the parties to the Multi Party bridge the MSC server requests the MGW to establish internal Nb connections with the PCM codec between the bearer terminations in the Multi Party bridge context and the call leg contexts, using the standard external bearer setup procedures of SIP-I based Nc. The held party is informed about the retrieval of the held call, and the both remote parties are informed about the multi party call establishment.\nNote:\tSee Clause 13.7.2.\nFigure 13.7.6.2: Information flow for multi party call, internal IP bearer (message sequence chart)",
