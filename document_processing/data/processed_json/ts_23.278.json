The use of B timer in the IM-SSF is indicated in the SDL Process MO_IM_SSF. There are other SIP timers defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 [8] that are not specified in the SDLs for IM-SSF processing. The usage of these timers is based on the network's implementation of the IM-SSF (e.g. choice of UDP or TCP for transport of SIP, and how IM-SSF operates as both a UAS and a UAC - i.e. back-to-back UA).\nThe following clauses provide additional information on Process MO_IM_SSF's handling of the internal timers:\nSheets 1-2: The inclusion of Expires header field in the INVITE method is optional and is used to indicate the duration of the invitation in seconds. When the timer fires before a final response is generated by the IM-SSF, the INVITE message is considered to be \"expired\". The IM-SSF shall report a call abandon event to the gsmSCF if requested and return a 487 Request Terminated to the originating S-CSCF.\nWhen the IM-SSF (taking the role of a UAC) sends out the INVITE request, the B timer (i.e. Tb timer) shall be used for the INVITE transaction timeout timer. Refer to 3GPP TS 24.229 [8] for the recommended B timer value.\nSheet 3:  When the IM-SSF (taking the role of a UAS) sends the 200 OK final response to the S-CSCF that sent the INVITE request, the IM-SSF shall start the Tack timer to monitor the receipt of the ACK request. Refer to 3GPP TS 24.229 [8] for the recommended ACK timer value.\nSheet 4: The expiration of Tb timer shall be reported as a no answer event to the gsmSCF if requested.  If the Tinvite timer expires, the IM-SSF shall report a call abandon event to the gsmSCF if requested.\nSheet 5: The expiration of the Tack shall be reported to the gsmSCF as a call disconnect from the originating party if requested.\nFigure 4.13-1: Process MO_IM_SSF (sheet 1)\nFigure 4.13-2: Process MO_IM_SSF (sheet 2)\nFigure 4.13-3: Process MO_IM_SSF (sheet 3)\nFigure 4.13-4: Process MO_IM_SSF (sheet 4)\nFigure 4.13-5: Process MO_IM_SSF (sheet 5)\nFigure 4.13-6: Process MO_IM_SSF (sheet 6)\nFigure 4.14-1: Procedure CAMEL_IMCN_MO_ O_IM_CSI_INIT (sheet 1)\nFigure 4.14-2: Procedure CAMEL_IMCN_MO_O_IM_CSI_INIT (sheet 2)\nFigure 4.14-3: Procedure CAMEL_IMCN_MO_O_IM_CSI_INIT (sheet 3)\nFigure 4.15-1: Procedure CAMEL_IMCN_MO_D_IM_CSI_INIT (sheet 1)\nFigure 4.15-2: Procedure CAMEL_IMCN_MO_D_IM_CSI_INIT (sheet 2)\nFigure 4.15-3: Procedure CAMEL_IMCN_MO_D_IM_CSI_INIT (sheet 3)\nFigure 4.16: Procedure CAMEL_IMCN_MO_CANCEL (sheet 1)\nFigure 4.17‑1: Procedure CAMEL_IMCN_MO_ANSWER (sheet 1)\nFigure 4.17‑2: Procedure CAMEL_IMCN_MO_ANSWER (sheet 2)\nFigure 4.18‑1: Procedure CAMEL_IMCN_MO_UNSUCCESSFUL (sheet 1)\nFigure 4.18‑2: Procedure CAMEL_IMCN_MO_UNSUCCESSFUL (sheet 2)\nFigure 4.18‑3: Procedure CAMEL_IMCN_MO_UNSUCCESSFUL (sheet 3)\nFigure 4.18‑4: Procedure CAMEL_IMCN_MO_UNSUCCESSFUL (sheet 4)\nFigure 4.18‑5: Procedure CAMEL_IMCN_MO_UNSUCCESSFUL (sheet 5)\nFigure 4.18‑6: Procedure CAMEL_IMCN_MO_UNSUCCESSFUL (sheet 6)\nFigure 4.19: Procedure CAMEL_IMCN_MO_DISC1 (sheet 1)\nFigure 4.20‑1: Procedure CAMEL_IMCN_MO_DISC2 (sheet 1)\nFigure 4.20‑2: Procedure CAMEL_IMCN_MO_DISC2 (sheet 2)\nFigure 4.21-1: Procedure CAMEL_OCH_CTR (sheet 1)\nFigure 4.21-2: Procedure CAMEL_OCH_CTR (sheet 2)\nFigure 4.21-3: Procedure CAMEL_OCH_CTR (sheet 3)\nFigure 4.21-4: Procedure CAMEL_OCH_CTR (sheet 4)\nFigure 4.21-5: Procedure CAMEL_OCH_CTR (sheet 5)",

It is used to address the required application/SLP within the gsmSCF.\nSubscriber State\n-\nC\nThis IE indicates the status of the IMS Subscriber. The states are:\n-\tCAMELBusy: The IMS subscriber is engaged on a transaction for an originating or terminating IM call session.\n-\tNetworkDeterminedNotReachable: The network can determine from its internal data that the IMS subscriber is not reachable.\n-\tAssumedIdle: The state of the IMS subscriber is neither \"CAMELBusy\" nor \"NetworkDeterminedNotReachable\".\nTime And Timezone\nM\nM\nThis IE contains the time that the IM‑SSF was triggered, and the time zone the IM‑SSF resides in.",
