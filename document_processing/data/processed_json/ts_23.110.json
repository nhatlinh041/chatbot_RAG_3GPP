Some radio access bearers may be asymmetric, i.e., have different parameters on uplink and downlink.\n6)\tThere are radio access bearers for both connection oriented packet-switched services, connectionless (store-and-forward) services, and circuit-switched traffic.\n7)\tParameters for connection-oriented radio access bearers may change during connection (bandwidth on demand, quality management).\n8)\tWhether a terminal can be registered and have connections to several Core Networks simultaneously (i.e., over different instances of Iu) is FFS.\n9)\tThe Access Stratum can provide several parallel and independent radio access bearers to one user equipment each with its own characteristics.\n10)\tMultimedia is handled outside the Access Stratum by multiplexing several streams onto one radio access bearer or by requesting several parallel radio access bearers. In the latter case, the possibly needed synchronisation is handled outside the Access Stratum.\n11)\tConnection of a user equipment to several URAN at a time has to be studied.\n12)\tHandover and if applied macrodiversity within one Access Network is handled within the Access Stratum.\n13)\tHandover between two Access Networks (e.g., two UTRANs, or between UTRAN and GSM BSS) may use support from the Core Network.\n14)\tThe Access Stratum should hide all access -specific parameters, e.g., location data provided to the Core Networks should be independent from the actual configuration of the Access Network.\n15)\tThe user equipment can be connected to different AN/CN points via a single Access Network.

Radio access bearers shall support real time as well as non real time user traffic.\n2)\tRadio access bearers must be flexible enough to support different traffic types, activity levels, throughput rates, transfer delays and bit error rates. Attributes allowing efficient use of radio resources are crucial.\n3)\tEfficient mapping from the traffic attributes used by non-UMTS applications, given by dominating external network technologies, to the attributes of the radio access bearer layer of the access stratum is essential. Complexity in mapping procedures should be avoided.\n4)\tDefinitions of traffic attributes and traffic management for radio access bearers shall be consistent with the predominant networking technology on the market (e.g. N-ISDN and IP networks for UMTS phase 1). As networking technologies emerge, adapted radio access bearer attributes and types shall gradually be added.\n5)\tRadio access bearer definitions must allow for straightforward and efficient traffic management and resource handling of the radio resources in the access stratum.\nThis procedure is part of the NAS. Example are 13.0 kbit/s (for GSM speech) and 2B+D (for ISDN BRI).\nThe protocols required in AS to provide a radio access bearer should be able to describe both packet switch and circuit switch types of connections.",

This is meant to be used for charging, location-based services, lawful interception, emergency calls, etc., as well as the positioning services.\nWhen location identification is supported by URAN, the following apply:\nURAN obtains 'Area ID' and/or geographic co-ordinates with uncertainty parameters for identification of the likely location of UE, to be sent to the NAS entity side of the CN (i.e., edge node) 'Area ID' represents either a radio access cell/sector or a geographic area. 'Area ID' is coded in the same format as Cell Global Identification (CGI), for compatibility to GSM.\nLocation information is categorised to two levels of accuracy. The Basic Level of information is what URAN obtains without extra signalling with the UE. The advanced level is obtained through extra signalling for positioning. Both levels can be used for both, Positioning services and other applications.\nLocation information is always at least obtained from URAN by the appropriate edge node(s) at the activation of a Call/PDP Context. Mechanism to make it possible to obtain the location information at the release of a Call/PDP Context should be specified. Location information sent to the edge node at other occasions is on the basis of asynchronous requests from the edge node to URAN. An edge node can request URAN to send the location information with the two types of requests, Type 1 (Direct request) where URAN sends location information only once at the request and Type 2 (Event request) where URAN sends location information at each specified event (e.g. Cell Update) requested by the edge node.",

The nature of Broadcast and Multicast services, like Cell Broadcast Service (CBS), is very different from other specified services. The following model characteristics are missing to fulfil the CBS requirements, namely:\n1.\tCBS uses two segments with different QoS requirements to deliver CB messages to the UE:\n1a.\tFrom Cell Broadcast Centre (CBC) to RNC, a SAP is required where for instance, 1 second turnaround time, interactive class, with a reliable transport is required.\n1b.\tFrom RNC to UE, a SAP is required where for instance, a maximum delay of 10 seconds and a background class is required.\n2.\tBecause of (item 1), the service primitives used by each of the segments may also be different; i.e., the related SAPs to those primitives may differ in the two segments and a combination of GC, Nt, and DC SAPs requires study.\n3.\tCBS traffic is asymmetric in nature. The communication flow is only in one direction from the CBC to the UE. There is no uplink channel needed and the UE can not initiate a communication or request specific information.\nAt least two changes are envisaged and thus detailed contributions are expected:\ni.\tIntroduce a new SAP type.\nii.\tMapping example between the two communication segments.\nFigure 2 shows also, as an example, some details of the AS architecture. The details are out of the scope of this document and are further specified in the 25-series.\nThis model does not exclude, nor imply, which protocol is specified between the UE-AS entity and the CN-AS entity. These protocols are 'transparent' for the AN, but participate in the service provided by the AS.",

A connection is a relationship between temporary contexts respectively in the AN and in the CN. The context in the AN is initiated at the establishment of the connection, and erased when the connection is released. Several types of connections are identified, such as point connection (single user) and group connections.\nThere are typically a great number of Dedicated Control SAPs per AN/CN connection point. SAPs are identified by a SAPI at the AS boundary. During the lifetime of a connection, the connection can be identified unambiguously by the SAPI of the associated SAP, and the SAPI is used as a reference in the exchanges at the AS boundary on the infrastructure side.\nA SAPI is used as a connection identifier allocated unambiguously to each connection during its lifetime, and used in the exchanges at the AS boundary on the infrastructure side.\nOn the UE side, a possible modelling is to consider that there is a single dedicated control SAP in an MS.\nNOTE 1:\tOn the UE side, an open issue is whether simultaneous services from distinct ANs can be provided to an MS. Settling this issue may lead to a different model, for instance with the possibility to have several Dedicated Control SAPs, one per AN with which an active context exists. Another issue, visible when analysing Point-to-Multipoint services in GSM, is the SAP modelling for those PTM services.\nNOTE 2:\tThe model is limited in this version to the cases where all the activity between a User Equipment and the infrastructure pertains to the same subscriber.

The operation caters only for transmission from AS boundary to access boundary. Upper layers of protocol are typically added for addressing and routing beyond this boundary.\nSeveral independent streams can exist simultaneously on the same connection, as distinguished by a routing and transaction identifiers. Message order is guaranteed, if applicable, on a stream basis. Routing identifiers are typically used to indicate originator and destination (e.g., USIM to Home, ME to Serving, and also distinctions such as GSM between MM and CC for instance...). Transaction identifiers are used to distinguish streams with the same originator and destination. Messages can be sent within a transaction or not. Transactions are explicitly set up and released, either in-band (i.e., together with information transfer) or out-band. Transaction identifiers have only a local significance.\nNOTE 1:\tThere is a difficulty behind the message order. In some cases it may be important to keep message order in a combination of streams, e.g., within a route, or even involving two routes. The model presented so far is too simple to cope with such cases.\nA quality of service indication is present in sending requests. This covers such aspects as message order, effect on other on-going traffic (e.g., speech pre-emption), delay. A finite number of quality of service classes will be identified, and the one to apply to a message indicated.\nWith each transaction is associated a default quality of service, established at transaction establishment or by a subsequent modification request.\nA transmission mode indication is present in reception indications. This gives information from the Access Stratum on the aspects of the transmission related to service quality of service (e.g., speech has been pre-empted).\nNOTE 2:\tThis covers circuit data transport, including cases where each message is very small (down to 1 bit or other information quantum).

      "content": "This clause describes the radio access bearer (RAB) by referencing a list of attributes related to the QoS. The radio access bearers are divided into two categories:\n-\tRestricted radio access bearers;\n-\tUnrestricted radio access bearers.\nAn unrestricted radio access bearer is meant for data requiring bit sequence integrity (;e.g., N-ISDN data transport), whereas a restricted radio access bearer contains a description of the nature of the information (;e.g., encoded voice). For a restricted radio access bearer, the characteristics are implicitly given.\nThe characterisation of a radio access bearer is made by using a set of attributes. A radio access bearer attribute is a specific characteristic that distinguishes it from other radio access bearer services. Refer to TS 23.107 [5] for a list of these QoS attributes. Particular values are also indicated in that specification for different services.\nIn order to describe the desired radio access bearer service, QoS attributes are defined at the SAP. Note that it is not necessary, nor meaningful to support all possible combinations of parameter settings.\nNOTE:\tIn case of an unrestricted radio access bearer, for every SDU provided at the SAP, bit sequence integrity should be maintained.",
