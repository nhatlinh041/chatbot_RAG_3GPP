The PSI Activation State shall be set to Inactive.\nThe PSI(s) used to identify a shared Repository Data are contained in a specific Repository Data (identified by a dedicated Service Indication value \"SHARED-REPOSITORY-DATA-IDENTIFICATION\") stored for each  subscriber to whom this shared Repository Data applies.\nOne or multiple shared Repository Data may be stored in the HSS, while a subscriber may reference one or several of them.\nWhen an AS wants to read a shared Repository Data for a subscriber, the AS should retrieve first the PSI(s) contained in the Repository Data identified by the dedicated Service Indication value \"SHARED-REPOSITORY-DATA-IDENTIFICATION\" and the Public Identity of this subscriber. Then, the AS uses received PSI(s) to retrieve the shared Repository Data, using corresponding specific Service Indication.\nThe AS should store the shared Repository Data locally and it should subscribe to notifications on changes. If shared Repository Data is modified, the HSS notifies the AS about it with a single Sh notification.\nSee figure 12.2-1 for an example of shared Repository Data usage.\nFigure 12.2-1: Shared Data example\nIf the same Repository Data is defined for a subscriber both as individual Repository Data and shared Repository Data, the individual one shall take precedence.\nThe same Repository Data shall not be defined as different shared Repository Data for the same subscriber.",
