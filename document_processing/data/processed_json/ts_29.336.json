If not, Experimental-Result shall be set to DIAMETER_ERROR_UNAUTHORIZED_SERVICE (5511) in the Configuration Information Answer.\n3a.\tIf the request is IMSI Group Id Retrieval (as indicated by the CIR-Flags AVP), the HSS shall return the IMSI Group Id(s) in the order of sequence that corresponds to the order of sequence of the received External Group Identifier(s) received in the User-Identifier AVP and AdditionalIdentifiers AVP. The Result Code shall be set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS. Stop processing.\nOtherwise, continue to step 4.\nNOTE:\tApplicable steps 4-8 are performed for each monitoring event type or communication pattern requested.\n4.\tCheck whether the limits on number of monitoring events that can be requested per monitoring type and SCEF-ID is reached. If so, Result-Code in Monitoring-Event-Config-Status for the affected service(s) shall be set to DIAMETER_RESOURCES_EXCEEDED (5006). The Result-Code shall be set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS in the Configuration Information Answer.\n4a.\tCheck whether the requesting SCEF is authorized to request the specific service configuration(s) (e.g. Monitoring Event Type indicates a specific monitoring event configuration). If not, Experimental-Result-Code in Monitoring-Event-Config-Status for the affected service configuration(s) shall be set to DIAMETER_ERROR_UNAUTHORIZED_REQUESTING_ENTITY (5510). The Result-Code shall be set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS in the Configuration Information Answer.\n4b.\tCheck that the requested specific service configuration(s) (e.g. Monitoring Event Type) is authorized for the UE or the group of UEs. If not, Experimental-Result-Code in Monitoring-Event-Config-Status for the affected service(s) shall be set to DIAMETER_ERROR_UNAUTHORIZED_SERVICE (5511). The Result-Code shall be set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS in the Configuration Information Answer.\n5.\tWhen the request is for a group, i.e. because the External-Identifier AVP of the User-Identifier AVP contain an External Group Identifier, the HSS applies the Monitoring-Event-Configuration AVP to each UE of the Group and includes the CIA-Flags AVP with the Group-Configuration-In-Progress bit set in the Configuration Information Answer. The Result-Code shall be set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS in the Configuration Information Answer.If the CIR command is to delete configured monitoring event(s) for certain UE(s) in a group of UEs, i.e. Monitoring-Event-Configuration AVP(s) containing Exclude-Identifier AVP, and the HSS supports Dynamic-Group-Event-Monitoring feature, the HSS shall cancel the monitoring event(s) for the UE(s) indicated by Exclude-Identifier AVP and keep monitoring events(s) for other UEs in the group, as specified in clause 5.6.1 of 3GPP TS 23.682 [2].\nIf the CIR command is to add configured monitoring event(s) for certain UE(s) in a group of UEs, i.e. Monitoring-Event-Configuration AVP(s) containing Include-Identifier AVP, and the HSS supports Dynamic-Group-Event-Monitoring feature, the HSS shall create the monitoring event(s) for the UE(s) indicated by Include-Identifier AVP, as specified in clause 5.6.1 of 3GPP TS 23.682 [2].\n6.\tIf a serving node is registered and is involved in the reporting of the configured monitoring event, the HSS shall forward the monitoring event configuration to the serving node and wait for the answer before sending the Configuration Information Answer to the SCEF. The monitoring event configuration status from the serving node for each event shall be conveyed by the HSS to the SCEF. The Result-Code shall be set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS in the Configuration Information Answer.\n7.\tIf the user is not registered in any serving node or the user is purged in the registered serving node(s), the HSS shall store the configuration data related to the service; also, it shall indicate to the SCEF that the user is absent, in the Configuration Information Answer, by setting the relevant bit in the S6t-HSS-Cause IE. The Result-Code shall be set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS in the Configuration Information Answer.\n8.\tFor Monitoring, if the data related to an immediate reporting is available in the HSS, the HSS (e.g. as being received from the MME/SGSN in the Insert Subscriber Data answer) shall include this data in the Configuration Information Answer.For Monitoring events that can be answered by the HSS without requiring interation with the serving node (e.g. roaming status, IMEI-Change), the HSS shall respond immediately, either in the CIA or in an immediate RIR.\nIf the HSS is aware that the UE is registered in an MME and an SGSN and the services supported by the MME and SGSN are different, the HSS shall additionally report the capabilities of the different nodes to the SCEF by including Supported-Services AVP(s) with the subset of services supported by the serving node(s) among those supported by the HSS, as indicated by the Node-Type AVP (e.g. HSS, MME). If the capabilities are the same reported from the MME, the SGSN and the HSS, the HSS shall report the service capabilities without Node-Type to the SCEF. If the Supported-Services of the SGSN and MME are different and the UE is purged in SGSN or MME the HSS shall report the Supported-Services to the SCEF excluding the Supported-Services from the purged node.\nIf the HSS receives CIR command from SCEF and has sent IDR commands over S6a/S6d to an MME and an SGSN, the HSS shall check the Result-Codes in Monitoring-Event-Config-Status AVPs reported by the MME and the SGSN:\n-\tif they are different, the HSS shall include both Service-Report AVPs with the respective Node-Type (indicating the type of serving node) in the Monitoring-Event-Config-Status AVP to the SCEF in the CIA command;\n-\totherwise, the HSS shall include one Service-Report AVP without Node-Type in the Monitoring-Event-Config-Status AVP to the SCEF in the CIA command.\nIf the configuration data in the CIR command are out of the allowed range, the HSS shall set the Experimental-Result-Code in Monitoring-Event-Config-Status for the affected service(s) to DIAMETER_ERROR_REQUESTED_RANGE_IS_NOT ALLOWED (5512).\nIf the received SCEF Reference ID for Deletion does not exist, the HSS shall set the Experimental-Result-Code in Monitoring-Event-Config-Status for the affected service(s) to DIAMETER_ERROR_CONFIGURATION_EVENT_NON_EXISTANT (5514).\nIf the SCEF Reference ID exists and the old configuration data could not be replaced by new Configuration event data, the HSS shall set the Experimental-Result-Code in Monitoring-Event-Config-Status for the affected service(s) to DIAMETER_ERROR_CONFIGURATION_EVENT_STORAGE_NOT_SUCCESSFUL (5513).\nIf the HSS cannot fulfil the received request for reasons not stated in the above steps (e.g. due to a database error), it shall stop processing the request and set Result-Code in Configuration Information Answer to DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_COMPLY.\nIf the HSS detects that configuration data provided by a Monitoring-Event-Configuration are overwritten by a CIR command and both configurations were initiated by the same SCEF, the HSS shall include in the CIA command the Monitoring Event Report AVP including the SCEF Reference ID and SCEF Reference ID for Deletion of the overwritten configuration data.\nIf the HSS needs to report loss of connectivity it shall include the Monitoring-Type AVP set to \"LOSS_OF_CONNECTIVITY\" in the Monitoring Event Report. In addition, the HSS may also include the Loss-Of-Connectivity-Reason AVP in the Monitoring Event Report.\nFor the \"CHANGE_OF_IMSI_IMEI(SV)_ASSOCIATION\" event type, if there was no previous IMEI(SV) information stored in the HSS, and a new IMEI(SV) is received from the MME/SGSN, this is equivalent to a change of IMEI(SV) and the corresponding event shall be reported, by setting the \"IMEI\" flag (bit 0) in the IMEI-Change AVP, as described in clause 8.4.22.\nFor the \"ROAMING_STATUS\" event type, if there was no previous roaming status information stored in the HSS, and a certain PLMN ID value is received from the MME/SGSN, this is equivalent to a change of roaming status and the corresponding event shall be reported.\nIf the SCEF indicates the support of Monitoring event feature to the HSS and the HSS supports Monitoring. The HSS shall include the Supported-Services AVP with the Supported-Monitoring-Events AVP indicating the authorized monitoring events for the requesting SCEF in the CIA command.\nIf CIR message includes multiple SCEF Reference ID and one, several or all SCEF Reference ID Monitoring events cannot be handled, or fail to be configured at the registered serving node(s), the HSS shall report all SCEF Reference ID requested to the SCEF with an appropriate Experimental-Result-Code or Result-Code in the Monitoring-Event-Config-Status AVP(s).\nNOTE:\tIn order to avoid reattempts from the SCS/AS when some configuration failed at the serving node(s), based on operator's choice, the HSS can still store the configuration data, return a successful response to SCEF and report the SCEF with monitoring event(s) suspended. The configuration data can then be forwarded whenever traffic is received from MME/SGSN and event(s) can be reported to SCEF as resumed, as described in clause 7.2.2.\nIf a CIR message includes multiple SCEF Reference ID and for a SCEF Reference ID at least one CP parameter set cannot be handled, the HSS shall reply within the AESE-Communication-Pattern-Config-Status all SCEF Reference ID requested to the SCEF with an appropriate Experimental-Result-Code or Result-Code.\nIf an SCEF Reference ID received in a CIR command match with an SCEF Reference ID stored in the HSS and both SCEF Reference ID are provided by the same SCEF ID, the HSS shall delete the stored CP sets associated with the SCEF reference Id and store the new CP set(s).\nIf the CIR message contains combinations of monitoring events and CP parameter set it shall handle each set belonging to an SCEF Reference ID separately and shall send a combined answer to the SCEF with all SCEF Reference IDs requested.\nIf the SCEF Reference ID for Deletion is present, the receiving node shall delete the corresponding configuration, if stored.\nIf the SCEF Reference ID is present, the receiving node shall store the configuration event.\nIF the CIR message contains the CIR-Flags with delete all monitoring events, the HSS shall delete all Monitoring events configured by the SCEF for the subscriber. This includes forwarding the deletion to involved serving nodes. In this case the CIR message shall not contain new monitoring events.\nIf the CIR message contains the CIR-Flags with delete all communication pattern, and the feature Config-Eff-CP is supported, the HSS shall delete all Communication Pattern configured by the SCEF for the subscriber. This includes forwarding the deletion to involved serving nodes. In this case the CIR message shall not contain new communication pattern.\nIf the CIR message contains the CIR-Flags with delete all network parameter configurations, and the feature Config-Eff-NP is supported, the HSS shall delete all Suggested Network Configurations configured by the SCEF for the subscriber. This includes the updating of involved serving nodes. In this case the CIR message shall not contain new network parameter configurations.\nIf the CIR command contains the CIR-Flags AVP with the bit for Enhanced Coverage Query set, the HSS shall return the current settings of Enhanced Coverage together with the current Serving PLMN-ID (if any) in the CIA command.\nIf the CIR command contains Enhanced-Coverage-Restriction AVP, the HSS shall update the subscription data for Enhanced Coverage; the update shall be a complete replacement of any stored information with the received information. This may result in the need to update the MME/SGSN via S6a/d/MAP-Gr with the new value for access restriction; there is however no need for the HSS to delay sending of CIA until updates of serving nodes are confirmed.\nIf the CIR command contains Suggested-Network-Configuration AVP to update a previous Suggested Network Configuration (i.e. the SCEF Reference ID matches with an SCEF Reference ID stored in the HSS and both SCEF Reference IDs are provided by the same SCEF ID), the HSS shall check whether the suggested parameters are acceptable, and if so, update the stored UE's subscription parameters accordingly. The update shall be a complete replacement of any stored information with the received information. This may result in Insert Subscriber Data Signalling towards the UE's serving node. If the HSS modifies parameters received in Suggested-Network-Configuration AVP, the HSS shall inform the SCEF about the active parameters. When the HSS did not modify parameters received in the Suggested-Network-Configuration AVP, the HSS shall return a Suggested-Network-Configuration AVP to the SCEF in CIA containing only SCEF Reference ID and SCEF-ID.\nIf a Monitoring-Event-Report is included in a CIA command and the Monitoring-Event-Report is related to a One-time Monitoring event request, the HSS shall delete the related Monitoring event for the UE or the individual group member UE locally after sending the Monitoring-Event-Report.\nIf the subscribed periodic RAU/TAU Timer, Active Time, Suggested number of downlink packets, or any combinatio was previously set by a different SCEF requests including the Monitoring-Event-Configuration AVP(s) or Suggested-Network-Configuration AVP identified by a different SCEF Reference ID for the same UE, the HSS shall accept the request as follows:\n-\tIf the newly received the value of the Maximum-Detection-Time AVP or the Maximum-Latency AVP within the Monitoring-Event-Configuration AVP(s) or the value of the Subscribed-Periodic-RAU-TAU-Timer AVP within the Suggested-Network-Configuration AVP is lower than the provided subscribed periodic RAU/TAU timer, the HSS shall set the subscribed periodic RAU/TAU timer using the newly received value.\n-\tIf the newly received the value of Maximum-Response-Time AVP within the Monitoring-Event-Configuration AVP(s) or the value of the Active-Time AVP within the Suggested-Network-Configuration AVP is higher than the provided subscribed Active Time (i.e. previously provided Maximum Response Time), the HSS shall set the subscribed Active Time using the newly received value.\n-\tIf the DL-Buffering-Suggested-Packet-Count AVP is newly received within the Monitoring-Event-Configuration AVP(s) or Suggested-Network-Configuration AVP, the HSS shall set the subscribed Suggested number of downlink packets by adding the newly received value to the currently used value of Suggested number of downlink packets if the aggregated value is within the operator defined range. If the aggregated value is not within the operator defined range, the HSS shall set the subscribed Suggested number of downlink packets according to operator defined range.",

This will apply to the SIR request commands.\nThe MTC-IWF can consider some messages with a lower or a higher priority; lower priority messages will be candidates for throttling before higher priority messages.\nFollowing considerations can be taken into account:\n-\tSIR messages for a given SCS can have a lower priority according to operator policies;\n-\tIf a SCS node generates a peak signalling over the Tsp interface, SIR messages over S6m related to this SCS can have a lower priority;\n-\tThe SIR messages over S6m related to a recall procedure or a replace procedure over the Tsp interface (see 3GPP TS 29.368 [13]) may have a lower priority according to operator policies.\nB.3\tMessage prioritisation over S6t\nThis clause gives an analysis of possible behaviours of the SCEF regarding message prioritisation as guidance and for an informative purpose.\nWhen the HSS is overloaded, the SCEF will receive overload reports from the HSS requesting a reduction of requests sent by the SCEF. This will apply to the CIR request commands.\nThe SCEF can consider some messages with a lower or a higher priority; lower priority messages will be candidates for throttling before higher priority messages.\nFollowing considerations can be taken into account:\n-\tCIR messages for a given SCEF can have a lower priority according to operator policies;\n-\tIf a SCEF node generates a peak signalling over the S6t interface, CIR messages from this SCEF can have a lower priority;\nAnnex C (normative):Diameter message priority mechanism\nC.1\tGeneral\nIETF 7944 [20] specifies a Diameter routing message priority mechanism that allows Diameter nodes to indicate the relative priority of Diameter messages. With this information, other Diameter nodes may leverage the relative priority of Diameter messages into routing, resource allocation, set the DSCP marking for transport of the associated Diameter message, and also abatement decisions when overload control is applied.\nIt is recommended to make use of IETF 7944 [20] over the S6m, S6n and S6t interfaces of an operator network when the overload control defined in Annex A is applied on these interfaces.\nC.2\tS6m, S6n, S6t interfaces\nThe Diameter message priority mechanism is an optional feature which may apply on one or several of the S6m, S6n, S6t interfaces.\nA 3GPP functional entity supporting the Diameter message priority mechanism over one or several of the S6m, S6n, S6t interfaces shall comply with IETF RFC 7944 [20].\nA 3GPP functional entity sending a request shall determine the required priority according to its policies. When priority is required, it shall include the DRMP AVP indicating the required priority level in the request it sends, and shall prioritise the request according to the required priority level.\nWhen the 3GPP functional entity receives the corresponding response, it shall prioritise received response according to the priority level received within the DRMP AVP if present in the response, otherwise according to the priority level of the corresponding request.\nWhen a 3GPP functional entity receives a request, it shall handle the request according to the received DRMP AVP priority level. For the response, it may modify the priority level received in the DRMP AVP according to its policies and shall handle the response according to the required priority level. If the required priority level is different from the priority level received in the request, it shall include the DRMP AVP in the response.\nThe decisions of the 3GPP functional entity for a required priority and for the priority level value are implementation specific.\nIf:\n-\ta 3GPP functional entity supports using the Diameter message priority mechanism for DSCP marking purposes,\n-\tthe transport network utilizes DSCP marking, and\n-\tmessage-dependant DSCP marking is possible for the protocol stack transporting Diameter,\nthen the 3GPP functional entity shall set the DSCP marking for transport of the request or response according to the required priority level.\nDiameter requests related to high priority traffic should contain a DRMP AVP with a high priority of which the level value is operator dependent.\nAnnex D (normative):Diameter load control mechanism\nD.1\tGeneral\nIETF RFC 8583 [22] specifies a mechanism for sharing of Diameter load information. It includes the definition and the transfer of related AVPs between Diameter nodes.\nD.2\tS6m interface\nD.2.1\tGeneral\nThe Diameter load control mechanism is an optional feature over the S6m interface.\nIt is recommended to make use of IETF RFC 8583 [22] on the S6m interface where, when applied, the MTC-IWF shall behave as reacting nodes and the HSS as a reporting node.\nD.2.2\tHSS behaviour\nThe HSS may report its current load by including a Load AVP of type HOST in answer commands as described in IETF RFC 8583 [22].\nThe HSS calculates its current load by implementation specific means.
