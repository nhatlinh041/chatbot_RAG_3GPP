      "content": "This document defines the Stage 2 architecture and specification for the CS Fallback and for SMS over SGs for EPS or CS Fallback and SMS over S102. The scope of this document includes the architecture enhancements for functionality to enable fallback from E-UTRAN access to UTRAN/GERAN CS domain access and to CDMA 1x RTT CS domain access, and functionality to reuse of voice and other CS-domain services (e.g. CS UDI video / LCS / USSD) by reuse of the CS domain. The functionality specified to support SMS over SGs does not trigger any CS Fallback to UTRAN/GERAN. The functionality specified to support SMS over S102 does not trigger any CS Fallback to CDMA 1xRTT CS domain.\nIn addition this specification includes an SMS in MME architecture option for SMS services only. This functionality does not trigger any CS Fallback and does not require SGs.\nThe architecture enhancements to support CS fallback to CDMA 1x RTT CS domain access for UEs with single and dual receiver configurations are specified in Annex B.\nIn this Release of the specification no mechanisms are specified to support CS Fallback to both UTRAN/GERAN and CDMA 1xRTT in the same PLMN. So, even when a UE has the capability to support both CS Fallback to UTRAN/GERAN CS domain and CS Fallback to CDMA 1xRTT CS domain in a given PLMN, the PLMN implements only one of the two.",

The combined TA/LA Update Procedure is also performed in order to re-establish the SGs association.\nA UE that only supports NB-IoT (see TS 23.401 [2]) may request SMS service but send a TA Update instead of a combined TA/LA Update.\n2)\tThe UE initiates the TAU procedure by sending a TAU Request (parameters as specified in TS 23.401 [2] including the Update Type, old LAI and Mobile Station Classmark 2) message to the MME. The Update Type indicates that this is a combined Tracking Area/Location Area Update Request or a combined Tracking Area/Location Area Update with IMSI attach Request.

If the target network is a shared GERAN, the MME shall also take into account the UE capability of support or non-support of GERAN network sharing when selecting the PLMN for the CS domain as specified in TS 23.251 [42]. The PLMN selected for CS should be the same that is used for this UE as a target PLMN for PS handovers or for any other mobility procedures related to CSFB. The MME may take any access restrictions provided by the HSS into account, if the network is using separate location areas for GERAN and UTRAN cells. The selected PLMN ID is included in the newly allocated LAI. If the association has to be established or if the LA changed, the new MME sends a Location Update Request (new LAI, IMSI, MME name, Location Update Type, selected CS domain operator) message to the VLR. The cases in which the MME includes the selected CS domain operator towards the VLR are specified in TS 23.251 [42]. The MME retrieves the corresponding VLR number from the determined LAI. If multiple MSC/VLRs serve this LAI, the TMSI based NRI as provided by the UE or an IMSI hash function is used to retrieve the VLR number for the LAI as defined in TS 23.236 [23]. The Location Update Type shall indicate normal location update. The MME name is a FQDN string.\n5)\tThe VLR performs the normal subscription checks for CS and if all checks are successful performs Location Update procedure in CS domain.\nFor GWCN configuration, the MSC selects the core network operator as specified in TS 23.251 [42].\n6)\tThe VLR responds with Location Update Accept (VLR TMSI) to the MME.\n7)\tThe MME sends a TAU Accept (parameters as specified in TS 23.401 [2], LAI, VLR TMSI) message to the UE. The VLR TMSI is optional if the VLR has not changed. LAI is determined in step 4 above. The presence of the LAI indicates to the UE that it is IMSI attached.

      "content": "In relation with CSFB and/or SMS over SGs, when ISR is activated, the UE follows regular ISR behaviour. It may reselect between E-UTRAN and GERAN/UTRAN without a need to update the CN. When a mobile terminated service arrives, the MSC/VLR sends a paging message via SGs to the MME. The MME pages in the TA(s) registered for the UE, and, the MME uses the S3 interface to request the SGSN (i.e. the SGSN that has an ISR relation with the MME for that UE) to page the UE in the registered RA. When the UE is already connected with the MME, the MME forwards the paging request only to the UE via the established signalling connection.\nWhen the UE is IMS registered for voice service, even if the UE is configured for CSFB or SMS over SGs, it may need to ignore ISR activation based on the conditions for ISR activation/de-activation for UEs registered for IMS voice service as defined in TS 23.401 [2].\nA UE that supports CSFB and/or SMS over SGs includes the \"EMM combined procedures capability\" indication as part of the \"MS Network Capability\" in the Attach, RAU or combined RAU/LAU Request message, if the UE supports CSFB service or SMS over SGs. SGSN stores the \"EMM combined procedures capability\" indication for ISR operation as part of the stored \"MS Network Capability\". If the UE does not support CSFB or SMS over SGs, it shall not include the \"EMM combined procedures capability\" indication in the Attach, RAU or combined RAU/LAU Request message to SGSN.\nISR remains activated until the UE performs a combined RAU/LAU procedure (e.g. a UE in NMO I moves to a new RA or LA or the periodic TAU timer expires while the UE is in NMO I of GERAN/UTRAN) or separate LAU procedure (e.g. a UE moves to a different LA in NMO II or the periodic TAU timer expires while the UE is in NMO II of GERAN/UTRAN). Normal re-selection between registered RA/TA(s) does not cause ISR deactivated condition. When the UE needs to perform a combined RAU/LAU, the SGSN checks the \"EMM combined procedures capability\" bit in MS Network Capability and if it indicates that CSFB and/or SMS over SGs is supported then the SGSN deactivates ISR by not indicating ISR activated in the combined RAU Accept message, which is a regular ISR functionality as specified in TS 23.401 [2]. So an SGSN in a CSFB/SMS over SGs configuration never indicates ISR activated in combined RAU procedures for a UE that supports CSFB/SMS over SGs. An SGSN with ISR capability in a CSFB/SMS over SGs configuration shall always maintain ISR by indicating ISR Activated in Periodic RAU Accept for a UE that supports CSFB/SMS over SGs if the SGSN has the status that ISR is activated for the UE. After a combined RA/LA update procedure, the MSC pages via Gs for mobile terminated services. When Gs is not used, the MSC/VLR pages in the LA via Iu/A for mobile terminated services.\nIf ISR is deactivated and the UE re-selects to E-UTRAN with the TIN indicating \"P-TMSI\", it initiates a TAU procedure, which is a regular ISR functionality as specified in TS 23.401 [2], and ISR can be activated again. The UE that supports CS fallback/SMS over SGs shall perform this TAU procedure as a combined TA/LA Update Procedure.\nIn case of the detach procedure for E-UTRAN when ISR is activated, the MME notifies the associated SGSN with indicating detach cause (i.e. local detach or complete detach) as specified in clause 5.3.1, 5.3.2, 5.3.3 and TS 23.401 [2] except UE-initiated IMSI detach only procedure.\nIn case of the detach procedure for GERAN/UTRAN when ISR is activated, the SGSN sends an IMSI or GRPS Detach indication message to the VLR depending on the detach type sent by the UE as specified in TS 23.060 [3], clause 6.6.1, and notifies the associated MME with indicating detach cause (i.e. local detach, complete detach or IMSI detach only) and detach type (i.e. PS detach or combined PS/CS detach) in case of complete detach, and the MME sends IMSI Detach Indication or EPS Detach Indication message to the MSC/VLR accordingly, which is specified in clause 5.3.1A and 5.3.2A.\nWhen the MME receives a SGs paging for CS service, if ISR is activated and the mobile reachable timer has expired but the Implicit Detach timer has not expired, the MME shall not notify the MSC/VLR that the UE is unreachable via SGs and instead shall page the UE via S3 interface.\nWhen implicit detach timer expires in the MME, the MME shall send EPS Detach Indication message. .\nThe SGSN in NMO I configuration with ISR capability shall support the \"EMM combined UE Waiting Flag\".

The registered PLMN for CS domain is identified by the PLMN ID included in the LAI, which is allocated by the MME.\nIf MME determines the CS Fallback procedure needs priority handling based on MPS CS Priority in the UE's EPS subscription or because the call is an emergency call, it also sets priority indication, i.e. \"CSFB High Priority\", in the S1AP message to the eNodeB as specified in TS 36.413 [35]. In the case of emergency call, the MME also requests the eNodeB to inhibit roaming and access restrictions via the Additional CS Fallback Indicator as specified in TS 36.413 [35].\n1c.\tThe eNodeB shall reply with S1-AP UE Context Modification Response message.\n1d.\tIf configured to support the return to the last used PLMN after CSFB, the MME sends a MO CSFB indication via SGs to the MSC in order to indicate that the CM service request message, as described in step 4b in this clause , is due to the CSFB via CS MO call.\n2.\tThe eNodeB may optionally solicit a measurement report from the UE to determine the target GERAN/UTRAN cell to which PS handover will be performed.\nNOTE:\tBased on operator policy, the priority indicator received in step1b may be used by eNodeB to decide whether to continue CS Fallback procedures with PS HO, i.e. step3a, or to initiate radio release procedure to redirect the UE to 2G/3G Circuit Switch as specified in clause 6.3.\n3a.\tThe eNodeB triggers PS handover to a GERAN/UTRAN neighbour cell by sending a Handover Required message to the MME. The eNodeB selects the target PS handover cell considering the PLMN ID and possibly the LAC for CS domain provided by the MME in step 1b.\nIf the eNB is a HeNB, the HeNB should perform step 3 through step 6 of clause 6.3 instead of PS HO if the HeNB detects that the UE has only LIPA PDN Connections. CSFB will not be completed successfully when PS HO is performed if the UE has only LIPA PDN Connections as PS HO would result in the MME detaching the UE.\nNOTE 2:\tFor details how the HeNodeB determines whether a PDN connection is a LIPA PDN connection see TS 23.401 [2], clause 4.3.16.\nIn the following an inter-RAT handover from E-UTRAN to UTRAN or GERAN as specified in TS 23.401 [2] begins. The eNodeB indicates in the Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent container that PS handover was triggered due to CSFB. The eNodeB also indicates whether CSFB was triggered for emergency or priority call handling purpose. If the network supports a priority call handling, the eNodeB may forward the priority indication to the target GERAN/UTRAN in the Source to Target Transparent Container, and the target GERAN/UTRAN allocates radio bearer resources taking received priority indication take into account. As part of this handover, the UE receives a HO from E‑UTRAN Command and tries to connect to a cell in the target RAT. The HO from E-UTRAN Command may contain a CS Fallback Indicator which indicates to UE that the handover is triggered due to a CS fallback request. If the HO from E-UTRAN Command contains a CS Fallback Indicator and the UE fails to establish connection to the target RAT, then the UE considers that CS fallback has failed. Service Request procedure is considered to be successfully completed when PS Handover procedure is completed successfully.\nNOTE 3:\tDuring the PS HO the SGSN does not create a Gs association with the MSC/VLR.\nNOTE 4:\tService Request procedure supervision timer shall be sufficiently long considering the optional measurement reporting at step 2.\nWhen the UE arrives at the target cell, if the target RAT is UTRAN, the UE establishes the radio signalling connection by sending an RRC Initial Direct Transfer message as specified in TS 25.331 [7] that contains a NAS message. The CN Domain Indicator is set to \"CS\" in the Initial Direct Transfer message.\nIf the target RAT is GERAN A/Gb mode: The UE establishes a radio signalling connection by using the procedures specified in TS 44.018 [4] (i.e. UE requests and is assigned a dedicated channel where it sends a SABM containing a NAS message to the BSS and the BSS responds by sending a UA). Upon receiving the SABM (containing the NAS message) the BSS sends a COMPLETE LAYER 3 INFORMATION message (containing the NAS message) to the MSC which indicates CS resources have been allocated in the GERAN cell. If both the UE and the target cell support enhanced CS establishment in DTM (indicated by GERAN system information included within the HO from E‑UTRAN Command) a RR connection may be established while in packet transfer mode without release of the packet resources, see TS 43.055 [24]. After the establishment of the main signalling link as described in TS 44.018 [4] the UE enters either Dual Transfer Mode or Dedicated Mode.\n3b.\tIf the target RAT is GERAN and the UE has entered Dedicated Mode, the UE starts the Suspend procedure (see TS 44.018 [4]) unless both the UE and the Target cell support DTM in which case TBF re-establishment may be performed.\n3c.\tA Gn/Gp-SGSN that receives the Suspend message from the UE follows the Suspend procedure specified in TS 23.060 [3], clause 16.2.1.1.1.\nAn S4-SGSN that receives the Suspend message from the UE follows the Suspend procedure specified in TS 23.060 [3]. The S4-SGSN deactivates GBR bearers towards S-GW and P-GW(s) by initiating MS-and SGSN Initiated Bearer Deactivation procedure as specified in TS 23.060 [3], and starts the preservation and suspension of non-GBR bearers by sending Suspend Notification message to the S-GW. The S-GW releases all RNC related information (address and TEIDs) for the UE if Direct Tunnel is established, and sends Suspend Notification message to the P-GW(s). The SGSN stores in the UE context that UE is in suspended status. All the preserved non-GBR bearers are marked as suspended status in the S-GW and P-GW(s). The P-GW should discard packets if received for the suspended UE.\n4a.\tIf the LA of the new cell is different from the one stored in the UE (which is received as part of Combined Attach/TAU procedure in E-UTRAN), the UE shall initiate a Location Area Update procedure as follows:\n-\tif the network is operating in NMO-I (Network Modes of Operation), the UE shall initiate a separate Location Area Update before initiating the RAU procedure instead of a Combined RA/LA Update procedure (to speed up the CSFB procedure); or\n-\tif the network is operating in NMO-II, the UE shall initiate a Location Area Update before initiating the RAU procedure required for PS handover.\nWhen the UE initiates a Location Area Update the UE shall set the \"follow-on request\" flag in the LAU Request in order to indicate to the MSC not to release the Iu/A connection after the LAU procedure completion. The UE shall indicate to the target MSC that this is an originating call establishment as a result of CSFB by including the \"CSMO\" flag. Further the UE performs any Routing Area Update procedure as specified by TS 23.060 [3].\nThe UE may initiate a Location Area Update procedure immediately when the UE is handed over to the target cell i.e. before the UE receives e.g. LAI or NMO information as part of the RAN Mobility Information.\nWhen different from the serving MSC, the target MSC derives the Last Used LTE PLMN from the MAP Send Identification message received from the serving MSC/VLR during the Location Area Update procedure.\n4b.\tThe UE sends a CM Service Request to the MSC. The UE shall indicate to the MSC that this is an originating call establishment as a result of CSFB by including the \"CSMO\" flag.\n5.\tIf the UE is not registered in the MSC serving the 2G/3G target cell or the UE is not allowed in the LA, the MSC shall reject the CM service request, if implicit location update is not performed. The CM Service Reject shall trigger the UE to perform a Location Area Update or a Combined RA/LA Update procedure as specified in TS 23.060 [3] for the different Network Modes of Operation (NMO).\nWhen different from the serving MSC, the target MSC derives the Last Used LTE PLMN from the MAP Send Identification message received from the serving MSC/VLR during the Location Area Update procedure.\n6.\tThe UE initiates the CS call establishment procedure and the UE shall include the CSMO flag in the CM Service Request to the MSC.\n7.\tThe UE performs any remaining steps of the inter-RAT handover from E-UTRAN to UTRAN or GERAN as specified in TS 23.401 [2].\nIf the UE remains on UTRAN/GERAN after the CS voice call is terminated the UE performs normal mobility management procedures as defined in TS 23.060 [3] and TS 24.008 [21].",

If the eNodeB indicated UE to go to GERAN in step 3 but the UE finally camps on an UTRAN cell of the same RA that the UE is registered with and ISR active, the UE shall locally deactivate ISR.\nIf target RAT is GERAN A/Gb mode: The UE establishes a radio signalling connection by using the procedures specified in TS 44.018 [4] (i.e. UE requests and is assigned a dedicated channel where it sends a SABM containing a NAS message to the BSS and the BSS responds by sending a UA). Upon receiving the SABM (containing the NAS message) the BSS sends a COMPLETE LAYER 3 INFORMATION message (containing the NAS message) to the MSC which indicates CS resources have been allocated in the GERAN cell.

This triggers the (serving) SGSN to send a Suspend Request (TLLI, RAI) message to the old CN node identified by the RAI and TLLI. If ISR is not active, the RAI and TLLI refer to an MME. The MME returns a Suspend Response to the SGSN even though the GUTI cannot be derived from the P-TMSI and RAI pair. If ISR is active, the RAI and TLLI refer to the old S4-SGSN, In this case, if the serving SGSN is different from the old SGSN which has ISR association with MME, the old SGSN returns a Suspend Response to the serving SGSN.\nNOTE 3:\tFor step 7b and 8, the inter-SGSN suspending procedure of ISR active case are not shown in the figure.\n8.\tIf the S1-AP UE Context Release Request message, received from the eNodeB in step 4, indicates that the UE is not available for the PS service in the target cell, the MME deactivates GBR bearers towards S-GW and P-GW(s) by initiating MME-initiated Dedicated Bearer Deactivation procedure as specified in TS 23.401 [2], and starts the preservation and suspension of non-GBR bearers by sending Suspend Notification message to the S-GW. If ISR is active, the (old) S4-SGSN deactivates GBR bearers towards S‑GW and P‑GW(s) by initiating MS-and SGSN initiated Bearer Deactivation procedure as specified in TS 23.060 [3], and starts the preservation and suspension of non-GBR bearers by sending the Suspend Notification message to the S-GW, which is all triggered by the Suspend procedure in step 7. The S-GW sends Suspend Notification message to the P-GW(s) when it receives the Suspend Notification message from MME or S4-SGSN. If the S-GW receives two Suspend Notification messages for the same UE, it ignores the second one except for sending response. The MME stores in the UE context that UE is suspended status. If ISR is active, the (old) S4-SGSN stores in the UE context that UE is in suspended status. All the preserved non-GBR bearers are marked as suspended status in the S-GW and P-GW(s). The P-GW should discard packets if received for the suspended UE.\nNOTE 4:\tStep 8 can not be triggered by the Suspend procedure since the full GUTI can not be derived from the P-TMSI and RAI included in the Suspend Request message.\n9.\tThe UE continues with the MO call setup procedure with sending CM Service Request. The UE shall indicate to the MSC that this is an originating call establishment as a result of CSFB by including the \"CSMO\" flag.\n10a.\tIf the UE is not registered in the MSC serving the 2G/3G cell or the UE is not allowed in the LA, the MSC shall reject the service request, if implicit location update is not performed.\n10b.\tA UE detecting that the MSC rejected the service request shall perform the Location Area Update or a Combined RA/LA procedure according to existing GERAN or UTRAN procedures as specified in TS 23.060 [3] for the different Network Modes of Operation (NMO).\nWhen different from the serving MSC, the target MSC derives the Last Used LTE PLMN from the MAP Send Identification message received from the serving MSC/VLR during the Location Area Update procedure.\n10c.\tThe UE initiates the CS call establishment procedure and the UE shall include the CSMO flag in the CM Service Request to the MSC.\n11.\tAfter the CS voice call is terminated and if the UE is in GERAN and PS services are suspended, then the UE shall resume PS services as specified in TS 23.060 [3]. A Gn/Gp -SGSN will follow TS 23.060 [3] to resume the PDP Context(s); in addition, the Gn/Gp SGSN sends a Update PDP Context Request message to the GGSN/P‑GW, the GGSN/P‑GW resumes the PDP Context(s). An S4 SGSN will follow TS 23.060 [3] to resume the bearers, and informs the S-GW and P-GW(s) to resume the suspended bearers. If the UE has returned to E-UTRAN after the CS voice call was terminated, then the UE shall resume PS service by sending TAU Request to MME. If PS services resumption was unsuccessful before returning to E-UTRAN and ISR is active, the UE shall locally deactivate ISR before initiating the TAU procedure. The MME will in addition inform S-GW and P-GW(s) to resume the suspended bearers. Resuming the suspended bearers in the S-GW and in the P-GW should be done by implicit resume using the Modify Bearer request message if it is triggered by the procedure in operation, e.g. RAU, TAU or Service Request. The S-GW is aware of the suspend state of the bearers and will forward the Modify Bearer request to the P-GW. Explicit resume using the Resume Notification message should be used in cases when Modify Bearer Request is not triggered by the procedure in operation.\nNOTE 5:\tUpon termination of CS services, if all the PDN connections have been handed over to WLAN according to procedures defined in TS 23.402 [27] the UE does not need to resume the PS traffic over the current cell.\nIf the UE remains on UTRAN/GERAN after the CS voice call is terminated the UE performs normal mobility management procedures as defined in TS 23.060 [3] and TS 24.008 [21].",

Clause 6.6 describes the procedure when the procedure is rejected by the MME.\nFigure 7.2-1: Mobile Terminating Call in idle mode\n1.\tG‑MSC receives IAM.\n2.\tG‑MSC retrieves routing information of the terminating UE by Send Routing Info procedures as specified in TS 23.018 [5].\n3.\tG‑MSC sends IAM to the MSC on the terminating side as specified in TS 23.018 [5].\n4.\tThe MME receives a Paging Request (IMSI, VLR TMSI, Location Information, eMLPP priority level indication) message from the MSC over a SGs interface. IMSI is used by the MME to find the S‑TMSI. If the TMSI and the LAI are received from the MSC/VLR, the S-TMSI is used as the paging address on the radio interface. If the TMSI is not received from the MSC/VLR, the IMSI shall be used as the paging address on the radio interface. If location information is reliably known by MME (i.e. MME stores the list of TAs), the MME shall page the UE in all the TAs. If the MME does not have a stored TA list for the UE, the MME may use the location information received from the MSC to page the UE.\nNOTE 1:\tThe case when LAI is not received from MSC/VLR and the case when S-TMSI is not available are further described in clause 4.8.\nNOTE 2:\tThis procedure takes place before step 3, immediately after MSC receives MAP_PRN from HSS, if pre-paging is deployed.\nIf the MME receives a Paging Request message for an UE which is considered as detach for EPS services, the MME sends the Paging reject message to the MSC with an appropriate cause value. This rejection triggers the MSC to page the UE over A or Iu-cs interface.\nNOTE 3:\tIn case of a CS fallback capable UE in NMO II, there is a case where, for example, the MME releases the SGs association due to the UE idle mode mobility while the VLR still maintains the SGs association.\nIf the MME holds stored Paging Restriction information (see TS 23.401 [2]) for the UE that restricts the SGs Paging Request from causing paging, the MME sends the SGs Paging Reject message to the MSC containing an appropriate cause. The rest of the steps in the procedure are skipped.\nIf the MME receives Paging Request with eMLPP priority level indication from the MSC, then the MME determines based on its configuration whether this priority level requires CSFB priority call handling.\n5.\tIf the MME did not return an \"SMS-only\" indication to the UE during Attach or Combined TA/LA Update procedures, the MME sends a Paging (as specified in TS 23.401 [2]) message to each eNodeB. The Paging message includes a suitable UE Identity (i.e. S‑TMSI or IMSI) and a CN Domain Indicator that indicates which domain (CS or PS) initiated the paging message. In this case it shall be set to \"CS\" by the MME.\nIf the MME returned the \"SMS-only\" indication to the UE during Attach or Combined TA/LA Update procedures, the MME shall not send the paging to the eNodeBs and sends Paging Reject towards MSC to stop CS Paging procedure and this CSFB procedure stops.\nIf the MME determined in step 4 that CSFB priority call handling shall apply, the MME sets the priority level in the S1AP Paging message based on the value(s) configured in the MME for CSFB priority call handling.\n6.\tThe radio resource part of the paging procedure takes place. The message contains a suitable UE Identity (i.e. S‑TMSI or IMSI) and a CN Domain indicator. The eNodeB performs the paging procedure according to the priority level received with the S1AP Paging Request.\n7a.\tThe UE establishes an RRC connection and sends an Extended Service Request for mobile terminating CS fallback to MME. The UE indicates its S-TMSI in the RRC signalling. The Extended Service Request message is encapsulated in RRC and S1‑AP messages. The MME sends the SGs Service Request message to the MSC containing an indication that the UE was in idle mode (and hence, for example, that the UE has not received any Calling Line Identification information). Receipt of the SGs Service Request message stops the MSC retransmitting the SGs interface Paging message.\nNOTE 4:\tIn order to avoid the calling party experiencing a potentially long period of silence, the MSC may use the SGs Service Request message containing the idle mode indication as a trigger to inform the calling party that the call is progressing.\nIf the UE, when in MUSIM mode, upon reception of paging indication in E-UTRAN access decides not to accept the paging, the UE attempts to send a Reject Paging Indication in the Extended Service Request message unless it is unable to do so e.g. due to UE implementation constraints. The MME sends the SGs Paging Reject message to the MSC containing an appropriate cause. The UE remains reachable for future paging attempts based on stored (if any) Paging Restriction Information in the MME. The rest of the steps in the procedure are skipped.\nIf the MME determined in step 4 that CSFB priority call handling shall apply and the MME receives subsequent Extended Service Request in Step 7a, it detects this message is the response to the priority CS Fallback procedure initiated in step5. In this case, the MME processes this message with priority and set the priority indication, i.e. \"CSFB High Priority\", in step7b as specified in TS 36.413 [35].\nIf UE has only LIPA PDN connection and the cell accessed by the UE does not link to the L-GW where the UE had the LIPA PDN Connection, the MME shall reject the Extended Service Request with a reason code which results in the UE selecting GERAN or UTRAN as specified in TS 24.301 [34].\nIf the UE has only SIPTO at the Local Network PDN connections:\n(i)\tin a network with collocated L-GW deployment and the (H)eNB accessed by the UE is not collocated with the L-GW providing the SIPTO at the Local Network connectivity; or\n(ii)\tin a network with stand-alone GW deployment and the (H)eNB accessed by the UE is not connected to the Local Network where the stand-alone GW (with S-GW and L-GW collocated) providing the SIPTO at the Local Network connectivity is residing,\nthe MME shall reject the Extended Service Request with an appropriate cause value which results in the UE selecting GERAN or UTRAN.\nIf the UE has only SIPTO at the Local Network PDN connections and LIPA PDN connections, where:\n-\tthe SIPTO at the Local Network PDN connections fulfil criterion (i) or (ii) above; and\n-\tthe cell accessed by the UE does not link to the L-GW where the UE had the LIPA PDN connection,\nthe MME shall also reject the Extended Service Request with an appropriate cause value which results in the UE selecting GERAN or UTRAN.\n7b.\tMME sends S1‑AP: Initial UE Context Setup (UE capabilities, CS Fallback Indicator, LAI and other parameters specified in TS 23.401 [2]) to indicate the eNodeB to move the UE to UTRAN/GERAN.

Clause 6.6 describes the procedure when the procedure is rejected by the MME.\nFigure 7.3-1: CS Page in E-UTRAN, Call in GERAN/UTRAN\n1a.\tThe MSC receives an incoming voice call and responds by sending a Paging Request (IMSI or TMSI, optional Caller Line Identification and Connection Management information, CS call indicator, eMLPP priority level indication) to the MME over a SGs interface. The MSC only sends a CS Page for an UE that provides location update information using the SGs interface. In active mode the MME has an established S1 connection and if the MME did not return the \"SMS-only\" indication to the UE during Attach or Combined TA/LA Update procedures, the MME reuses the existing connection to send the CS Service Notification to the UE.\nIf the MME returned the \"SMS-only\" indication to the UE during Attach or Combined TA/LA Update procedures, the MME shall not send the CS Service Notification to the UE and shall send Paging Reject towards MSC to stop CS Paging procedure, and this CSFB procedure stops.\nIf the X2-based or S1-based handover procedure is ongoing when the MME receives a Paging Request over the SGs interface, the MME shall follow the procedures as specified in clauses 5.5.1.1.1 and 5.5.1.2.1 of TS 23.401 [2]  for X2-based handover and S1-based handover respectively.\nIf the Inter RAT handover procedure is ongoing when the MME receives a Paging Request over the SGs interface, the MME shall simply discard this message and no further action is performed by MME. In this case, mobile terminating call can be continued by the MSC retransmitting Paging message as specified in TS 29.118 [44].\nThe eNodeB forwards the CS Service Notification message to the UE. The message contains CN Domain indicator and, if received from the MSC, the Caller Line Identification.\nThe MME sends the SGs Service Request message to the MSC containing an indication that the UE was in connected mode. The MSC uses this connected mode indication to start the Call Forwarding on No Reply timer for that UE and the MSC should send an indication of user alerting to the calling party. Receipt of the SGs Service Request message stops the MSC retransmitting the SGs interface Paging message.\nNOTE 1:\tThe pre‑configured policy may be used by UE to avoid being disturbed without Caller Line Identification display and the detailed handling is to be decided by CT1 and CT6.\nNOTE 2:\tThis procedure can also take place immediately after MSC receives MAP_PRN from HSS, if pre-paging is deployed. Caller Line Identification and CS call indicator are also provided in the case of pre-paging.\nNOTE 3:\tIn order to avoid the calling party experiencing a potentially long period of silence, the MSC may use the SGs Service Request message as a trigger to inform the calling party that the call is progressing.\nIf the MME receives paging request message with eMLPP priority level indication from the MSC, then the MME determines based on its configuration whether this priority level requires CSFB priority call handling.\n1b.\tUE sends an Extended Service Request (Reject or Accept) message to the MME for mobile terminating CS fallback. The Extended Service Request message is encapsulated in RRC and S1‑AP messages. The UE may decide to reject CSFB based on Caller Line Identification.\n1c.\tUpon receiving the Extended Service Request (Reject) for mobile terminating CS fallback, the MME sends Paging Reject towards MSC to stop CS Paging procedure and this CSFB procedure stops.\n1d.\tMME sends an S1‑AP UE Context Modification Request (CS Fallback Indicator, LAI) message to eNodeB. This message: indicates to the eNodeB that the UE should be moved to UTRAN/GERAN. The registered PLMN for CS domain is identified by the PLMN ID included in the LAI, which is allocated by the MME.\nIf MME determined in Step 1a that CSFB priority call handling shall apply, the MME sends S1-AP UE Context Modification Request message to the eNodeB with priority indication, i.e. \"CSFB High Priority\", as specified in TS 36.413 [35].\n1e.\tThe eNodeB shall reply with S1-AP UE Context Modification Response message.\n2.\tThe eNodeB may optionally solicit a measurement report from the UE to determine the target GERAN/UTRAN cell to which PS handover will be performed.\nNOTE 4:\tBased on operator policy, the priority indicator received in step1b may be used by eNodeB to decide whether to continue CS Fallback procedures with PS HO, i.e. step3a, or to initiate radio release procedure to redirect the UE to 2G/3G Circuit Switch.\n3a.\tThe eNodeB triggers PS handover to a GERAN/UTRAN neighbour cell by sending a Handover Required message to MME. The eNodeB selects the target PS handover cell considering the PLMN ID and possibly the LAC for CS domain provided by the MME in step 1d.\nIf the eNB is a HeNB, the HeNB should perform step 3 through step 6 of clause 7.4 instead of PS HO if the HeNB detects that the UE has only LIPA PDN Connections. CSFB will not be completed successfully when PS HO is performed if the UE has only LIPA PDN Connections as PS HO would result in the MME detaching the UE.\nNOTE 5:\tFor details how the HeNodeB determines whether a PDN connection is a LIPA PDN connection see TS 23.401 [2], clause 4.3.16.\nIn the following an inter-RAT handover from E‑UTRAN to UTRAN or GERAN as specified in TS 23.401 [2] begins. The eNodeB indicates in the Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent container that PS handover was triggered due to CSFB. The eNodeB also indicates whether CSFB was triggered for emergency or priority call handling purpose. If the network supports a priority call handling, the eNodeB may forward the priority indication to the target GERAN/UTRAN in the Source to Target Transparent Container, and the target GERAN/UTRAN allocates radio bearer resources taking received priority indication take into account. As part of this handover, the UE receives a HO from E‑UTRAN Command and tries to connect to a cell in the target RAT. The HO from E-UTRAN Command may contain a CS Fallback Indicator which indicates to UE that the handover was triggered due to a CS fallback request. If the HO from E-UTRAN Command contains a CS Fallback Indicator and the UE fails to establish connection to the target RAT, then the UE considers that CS fallback has failed.\nThe UE establishes the signalling connection as described in step 4b.\nNOTE 6:\tDuring the PS HO the SGSN does not create a Gs association with the MSC/VLR.\n3b.\tIf the target RAT is GERAN and the UE has entered Dedicated Mode, the UE starts the Suspend procedure (see TS 44.018 [4]) unless both the UE and the Target cell support DTM in which case TBF re-establishment may be performed.\n3c.\tA Gn/Gp-SGSN that receives the Suspend message from the UE follows the Suspend procedure specified in TS 23.060 [3], clause 16.2.1.1.1.\nAn S4-SGSN that receives the Suspend message from the UE follows the Suspend procedure specified in TS 23.060 [3]. The S4-SGSN deactivates GBR bearers towards S-GW and P-GW(s) by initiating MS-and SGSN Initiated Bearer Deactivation procedure as specified in TS 23.060 [3], and starts the preservation and suspension of non-GBR bearers by sending Suspend Notification message to the S-GW. The S-GW releases all RNC related information (address and TEIDs) for the UE if Direct Tunnel is established, and sends Suspend Notification message to the P-GW(s). The SGSN stores in the UE context that UE is in suspended status. All the preserved non-GBR bearers are marked as suspended status in the S-GW and P-GW(s). The P-GW should discard packets if received for the suspended UE.\n4a.\tIf the LA of the new cell is different from the one stored in the UE, the UE shall initiate a Location Area Update procedure as follows:\n-\tIf the network is operating in NMO-I (Network Modes of Operation), the UE shall initiate a separate Location Area Update before initiating the RAU procedure instead of a Combined RA/LA Update procedure (to speed up the CSFB procedure); or\n-\tif the network is operating in NMO-II the UE shall initiate a Location Area Update procedure before initiating the RAU procedure required for PS handover.\nThe UE shall set the \"CSMT\" flag in the LAU Request. The \"CSMT\" flag is used to avoid missing MT call in roaming retry case. Further the UE performs any Routing Area Update procedure as specified in TS 23.060 [3].\nThe UE may initiate a Location Area Update procedure immediately when the UE is handed over to the target cell i.e. before the UE receives e.g. LAI or NMO information as part of the RAN Mobility Information.\nWhen the MSC receives a LA Update Request, it shall check for pending terminating CS calls and, if the \"CSMT\" flag is set, maintain the CS signalling connection after the Location Area Update procedure for pending terminating CS calls.\n4b.\tIf the UE does not initiate a LAU procedure, it shall respond with a Paging Response message to the MSC as follows:\n-\tIf the Target RAT is UTRAN or GERAN Iu mode: The UE establishes a radio signalling connection and responds to the paging by sending an RRC Paging Response as specified in TS 25.331 [7]. The CN Domain Indicator is set to \"CS\" in the Initial Direct Transfer message.\n-\tIf the Target RAT is GERAN A/Gb mode: The UE establishes a radio signalling connection and responds to paging by using the procedures specified in TS 44.018 [4] (i.e. UE requests and is assigned a dedicated channel where it sends a SABM containing a Paging Response to the BSS and the BSS responds by sending a UA). Upon receiving the SABM (containing a Paging Response message) the BSS sends a COMPLETE LAYER 3 INFORMATION message (containing a Paging Response message) to the MSC which indicates CS resources have been allocated in the GERAN cell. If both the UE and the target cell support enhanced CS establishment in DTM (indicated by GERAN system information included within the HO from E‑UTRAN Command) an RR connection may be established while in packet transfer mode without release of the packet resources, see TS 43.055 [24]. After the establishment of the main signalling link as described in TS 44.018 [4] the UE enters either Dual Transfer Mode or Dedicated Mode and the CS call establishment procedure completes.\nNOTE 7:\tThe BSS should be prepared to receive a Paging Response even when the corresponding Paging Request has not been sent by this BSS.\n5a.\tAfter performing the LAU procedure or after receiving the Paging Response the MSC shall establish the CS call if the UE is allowed in the LA.\n5b.\tIf the UE is not registered in the MSC that receives the Paging Response or the UE is not allowed in the LA, the MSC shall reject the Paging Response message by releasing the A/Iu-CS. The BSC/RNC in turn releases the signalling connection for UTRAN or GERAN CS domain. The signalling connection release shall trigger the UE to obtain the LAI, which causes the initiation of a Location Area Update or a Combined RA/LA procedure as specified in TS 23.060 [3] for the different Network Modes of Operation (NMO).\nThe Location Area Update triggers the Roaming Retry for CS Fallback procedure as defined in clause 7.5.\n5c.\tAfter performing the LAU procedure the MSC shall establish the CS call if the UE is allowed in the LA.\n6.\tThe UE performs any remaining steps of the inter-RAT handover from E-UTRAN to UTRAN or GERAN as specified in TS 23.401 [2]\nWith the exception of steps 1a and 1c, above, Call Forwarding (see TS 23.082 [31]) is performed on the basis of the TS 24.008 [21] signalling received on the GERAN/UTRAN cell.\nIf the UE remains on UTRAN/GERAN after the CS voice call is terminated the UE performs normal mobility management procedures as defined in TS 23.060 [3] and TS 24.008 [21].",

The UE uses the NACC information and/or the broadcast System Information and when it has the necessary information to access the GERAN cell, establishes a radio signalling connection.\n6b.\t(Step 6b is performed if step 3b, RRC release with redirection, was performed).\nThe UE moves to the target RAT, identifies a suitable cell preferably of the same PLMN as received in LAI IE of combined EPS/IMSI Attach/TAU Accept message,, receives the broadcast System Information and when it has the necessary information to access GERAN/UTRAN, establishes a radio signalling connection.\n6c.\t(Step 6c is performed if step 3c, RRC connection release with redirection and Multi Cell System Information, was performed)\nThe UE moves to the target RAT and identifies a suitable cell preferably of the same PLMN as received in LAI IE of combined EPS/IMSI Attach/TAU Accept message. The UE uses the Multi Cell System Information and/or the broadcast System Information and when it has the necessary information to access GERAN/UTRAN, the UE establishes the radio signalling connection.\nIf the UE receives the \"CS Fallback High Priority\" indication in the RRC Release message in Step 3b or 3c and the target is UTRAN, the UE sets the establishment cause value to \"Terminating High Priority Signalling\" in the RRC Connection Request in Steps 6b and 6c. If the target is GERAN, no special establishment cause value is set by the UE.\n6d.\tIf the LA of the new cell is different from the one stored in the UE, the UE shall initiate a Location Area Update regardless of the different Network Modes of Operation (NMO). The UE shall set the \"CSMT\" flag in the LAU Request. The \"CSMT\" flag is used to avoid missing MT call in roaming retry case. In NMO I, the UE in GERAN may perform LA update over the RR connection instead of combined RA/LA update over the packet access as defined in TS 24.008 [21], clause 4.7.5.2.5, unless enhanced CS establishment in DTM is supported. Further the UE performs any Routing Area Update procedure as specified in TS 23.060 [3].\nIn NMO I a CSFB UE shall perform LAU (and if it does so, shall set the \"CSMT\" flag) and RAU procedures instead of a Combined RA/LA Update procedure to speed up the CSFB procedure.\nWhen the MSC receives a LA Update Request, it shall check for pending terminating CS calls and, if the \"CSMT\" flag is set, maintain the CS signalling connection after the Location Area Update procedure for pending terminating CS calls.\nIf the eNodeB indicated UE to go to GERAN in step 3 but the UE finally camps on an UTRAN cell of the same RA that the UE is registered with and ISR active, the UE shall locally deactivate ISR.\n7.\tIf the target RAT is GERAN and DTM is not supported or the UE does not support DTM, the UE starts the Suspend procedure specified in TS 23.060 [3]. This triggers the (serving) SGSN to send a Suspend Request (TLLI, RAI) message to the old CN node identified by the RAI and TLLI. If ISR is not active, the RAI and TLLI refer to an MME. The MME returns a Suspend Response to the SGSN even though GUTI cannot be derived from the P-TMSI and RAI pair. If ISR is active, the RAI and TLLI refer to the old S4-SGSN, In this case, if the serving SGSN is different from the old SGSN which has ISR association with MME, the old SGSN returns a Suspend Response to the serving SGSN.\nNOTE 5:\tFor step 7b and 8, the inter-SGSN suspending procedure of ISR active case are not shown in the figure.\n8.\tIf the S1-AP UE Context Release Request message, received from the eNodeB in step 4, indicates that the UE is not available for the PS services in the target cell, the MME deactivates GBR bearers towards S-GW and P-GW(s) by initiating MME-initiated Dedicated Bearer Deactivation procedure as specified in TS 23.401 [2], and starts the preservation and suspension of non-GBR bearers by sending Suspend Notification message to the S-GW. If ISR is active, the (old) S4-SGSN deactivates GBR bearers towards S‑GW and P‑GW(s) by initiating MS-and SGSN initiated Bearer Deactivation procedure as specified in TS 23.060 [3], and starts the preservation and suspension of non-GBR bearers by sending the Suspend Notification message to the S-GW, which is all triggered by the Suspend procedure in step 7. The S-GW sends Suspend Notification message to the P-GW(s) when it receives the Suspend Notification message from MME or S4-SGSN. If the S-GW receives two Suspend Notification messages for the same UE, it ignores the second one except for sending response. The MME stores in the UE context that the UE is in suspended status. If ISR is active, the (old) S4-SGSN stores in the UE context that UE is in suspended status. All the preserved non-GBR bearers are marked as suspended status in the S-GW and P-GW(s). The P-GW should discard packets if received for the suspended UE.\nNOTE 6:\tStep 8 can not be triggered by the Suspend procedure since the full GUTI can not be derived from the P‑TMSI and RAI included in the Suspend Request message.\n9.\tIf the UE does not initiate a LAU procedure, the UE responds to the paging by sending a Paging Response message as specified in TS 44.018 [4] or TS 25.331 [7]. When received at the BSS/RNS, the Paging Response is forwarded to the MSC.\nNOTE 7:\tThe MSC should be prepared to receive a Paging Response after a relatively long time from when the CS Paging Request was sent (step 1a).\n9a.\tIf UE is registered in the MSC serving the 2G/3G cell and the UE is allowed in the LA the MSC shall establish the CS call.\n9b.\tIf the UE is not registered in the MSC that receives the Paging Response or the UE is not allowed in the LA, the MSC shall reject the Paging Response by releasing the A/Iu-cs connection. The BSS/RNS in turn releases the signalling connection for CS domain.\n9c.\tThe signalling connection release shall trigger the UE to obtain the LAI, which causes the initiation of a Location Area Update or a Combined RA/LA procedure as specified in TS 23.060 [3] for the different Network Modes of Operation (NMO).\nThe Location Area Update triggers the Roaming Retry for CS Fallback procedure as defined in clause 7.5.\nAfter performing the LAU procedure the MSC shall establish the CS call if the UE is allowed in the LA.\nWith the exception of steps 1a and 1c, above, Call Forwarding (see TS 23.082 [31]) is performed on the basis of the TS 24.008 [21] signalling received on the GERAN/UTRAN cell.\nAfter the CS voice call is terminated and if the UE is still in GERAN and PS services are suspended, then the UE shall resume PS services as specified in TS 23.060 [3]. A Gn/Gp- SGSN will follow TS 23.060 [3] to resume the PDP Context(s), which is done by the Routing Area Update procedure. During the Routing Area Update procedure in which the Gn/Gp SGSN sends a Update PDP Context Request message to the GGSN/P‑GW, the GGSN/P‑GW resumes the PDP Context(s). An S4 SGSN will follow TS 23.060 [3] to resume the bearers, and informs the S-GW and P-GW(s) to resume the suspended bearers. If the UE has returned to E-UTRAN after the CS voice call was terminated, then the UE shall resume PS service by sending TAU Request to MME. If PS services resumption was unsuccessful before returning to E-UTRAN and ISR is active, the UE shall locally deactivate ISR before initiating the TAU procedure. The MME will in addition inform S-GW and P-GW(s) to resume the suspended bearers. Resuming the suspended bearers in the S-GW and in the P-GW should be done by implicit resume using the Modify Bearer request message if it is triggered by the procedure in operation e.g. RAU, TAU or Service Request. The S-GW is aware of the suspend state of the bearers and shall forward the Modify Bearer request to the P-GW. Explicit resume using the Resume Notification message should be used in cases when Modify Bearer Request is not triggered by the procedure in operation.\nNOTE 8:\tUpon termination of CS services, if all the PDN connections have been handed over to WLAN according to procedures defined in TS 23.402 [27], when the UE returns to E-UTRAN the UE performs an attach with handover indication.\nIf the UE remains on UTRAN/GERAN after the CS voice call is terminated the UE performs normal mobility management procedures as defined in TS 23.060 [3] and TS 24.008 [21].",

The procedure is based on the \"Mobile Terminating Roaming Retry Call\" procedure defined in TS 23.018 [5] and there is an only minor adaptation of the procedure to support CS fallback.\nFigure 7.5-1: Roaming Retry for CS fallback\nThere are only 2 differences in this procedure compared to the \"Mobile Terminating Roaming Retry Call\" procedure defined in TS 23.018 [5].\n-\tThe first difference is that the paging message in E-UTRAN triggers the CS fallback which is followed by a location update in the new RAT. This functionality is already supported in the CS fallback flows for terminating calls and no additional functionality is needed.\n-\tThe second difference is that the UE includes the \"CSMT\" flag in the location update request message so that the signalling link is maintained for longer in case the IAM is delayed by the HLR.\nNOTE:\tRoaming Retry for CS fallback procedure is not designed to provide the target MSC/VLR with the information required for allowing UE return to the last used LTE PLMN after CSFB. If this is required for a certain deployment, Roaming Forwarding for CS fallback could be used.\n7.5a\tRoaming Forwarding for CS fallback\nThe procedure in this clause may be applied for mobile terminated calls where the MSC/VLR, to which the UE sends the LAU, is different from the MSC/VLR that sent the paging message to the UE. The procedure is based on the \"Mobile Terminating Roaming Forwarding\" procedure defined in TS 23.018 [5]; the specific behaviour for CSFB is described in this clause. This procedure avoids impacting all GMSC nodes and can coexist with Mobile Terminating Roaming Retry procedure described in clause 7.5.\nNOTE 1:\tIn order to support Mobile Terminating Roaming Forwarding both the MSC controlling the target cell, the MSC that sent the paging message to the UE and the HLR need to support the feature.\nNOTE 2:\tThis procedure has smaller call setup delay than Mobile Terminating Roaming Retry procedure especially in roaming cases.\nNOTE 3:\tIf the network does not support this procedure, the Mobile Terminating Roaming Retry procedure specified in clause 7.5 can be used.\nIn order to ensure roaming forwarding can be offered in all scenarios (e.g. in case of IMSI in the LAU Request from UE), HLRs should be updated to support MTRF. In order to permit Mobile Terminating Roaming Forwarding from the old VLR if the HLR is not updated to support MTRF but the visited network does support MTRF, the new VLR may include MTRF supported flag in Send Identification when it receives a Location Updating Request containing the \"CSMT\" flag.\nFigure 7.5a-1: Roaming Forwarding for CSFB\nThe main differences compared to the \"Mobile Terminating Roaming Forwarding\" procedure defined in TS 23.018 [5] are described below:\n-\tThe paging message in E-UTRAN triggers the CS fallback which is followed by a location update in the new RAT.\nNOTE 4:\tThis functionality is already supported in the CS fallback flows for terminating calls and no additional functionality is needed.\n-\tThe UE includes the \"CSMT\" flag in the location update request message so that the signalling link is maintained for longer in case the IAM is delayed by the old MSC/VLR.\n-\tIf the Location Update Request contains the \"CSMT\" flag set and a valid TMSI/old LAI, the new MSC/VLR may indicate to the old MSC/VLR that it supports MTRF in the Send Identification message. The new VLR then performs authentication to the Location update and updates the HSS. If the Location Update Request contains the IMSI, only HLR-based MTRF procedure can be used.\n-\tAfter Cancel Location is received from HSS, if the HLR authorised the MTRF call between the old and the new terminating MSCs or if the HLR did not disallow the MTRF call between the old and the new terminating MSCs but the new MSC/VLR indicated its MTRF support earlier in Send Identification message, the old MSC/VLR stops paging timer and checks roaming and charging pre-configured agreements with regards to call routeing to the new MSC/VLR. If these checks are successful, the old MSC/VLR sends a Provide Roaming Number request (MTRF Indicator, parameters received from the HLR) to the new MSC/VLR.\n-\tIn a MT CSFB call, last used LTE PLMN identity may be added in the Provide Roaming Number Request message from old MSC/VLR to new MSC/VLR, based on configuration.\n7.5b\tCoexistence of Roaming Retry and Roaming Forwarding for CS fallback\nIf an MSC/VLR supports both the procedures as specified in clause 7.5 and 7.5a, and the GMSC has indicated support roaming retry as specified in clause 7.5, the old MSC/VLR which sends the initial paging request can decide based on operator policy whether to follow the procedure specified in clause 7.5 or clause 7.5a.",

The HLR is requested for routing number for SMS services and the SMS message is forwarded to the MSC/VLR where the MS/UE is CS attached.\n5.\tThe MSC/VLR sends a Paging (IMSI, VLR TMSI, Location Information, SMS indicator) message to the MME.\n6.\tThe MME initiates the paging procedure by sending the Paging (as specified in TS 23.401 [2]) message to each eNodeB with cells belonging to the tracking area(s) in which the UE is registered. The UE is paged with its S‑TMSI.\n7.\tThe MS/UE is paged by the eNodeBs.\n8.\tThe UE sends a Service Request message to the MME. The UE indicates its S‑TMSI in the RRC signalling. The MME sends the S1-AP Initial Context Setup Request message to the eNodeB and the eNodeB establishes the Radio Bearers. If the UE and the MME accept to use Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation, then to enable SMS transfer the Service Request procedures defined in TS 23.401 [2] are not used, but instead UE and MME shall be using the Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation.\n8a.\tThe MME sends a Service Request message to the MSC. In order to permit the MSC to create an accurate charging record, the MME adds the IMEISV, the local time zone, the Mobile Station Classmark 2, and the UE's current TAI and E‑CGI.\n9a.\tThe MSC/VLR builds the SMS message to be sent as defined in TS 23.040 [14] (i.e. the SMS message consists of CP‑DATA/RP‑DATA/TPDU/SMS‑DELIVER parts). The MSC/VLR forwards the SMS message to the MME in a Downlink Unitdata message.\n9b.\tThe MME encapsulates the SMS message in a NAS message and sends the message to the MS/UE.\n9c, 9d.\tThe MS/UE acknowledges receipt of the SMS message to the MSC/VLR.\n10.\tThe MS/UE returns a delivery report as defined in TS 23.040 [14]. The delivery report is encapsulated in an NAS message and sent to the MME.\n11.\tThe MME forwards the delivery report to the MSC/VLR in an Uplink Unitdata message.\n12‑13.\tThese steps are performed as defined in TS 23.040 [14]. The delivery report is forwarded to the SC.\n14-15.\tIn parallel to steps 12-13, the MSC/VLR acknowledges receipt of the delivery report to the MS/UE.\n16.\tThe MSC/VLR indicates to the MME that no more NAS messages need to be tunnelled.\nThe MME should not use the SGs Release Request message as a trigger for the release of S1 resources.\nNOTE:\tAlthough the MME could use the RRC establishment cause (set to mt-Access) sent in the S1-AP Initial UE Message in step 8 to deduce that the MS/UE sent the Service Request solely for receiving the SMS), the MME does not know whether the MT-SMS might cause the initiation of user plane traffic or an MO SMS. So, for simplicity of MME implementation, the normal eNodeB procedures should be used to initiate the release of S1 resources.\n8.2.4a\tMobile Terminated SMS in extended Idle mode DRX and in PSM\n8.2.4a.1\tGeneral\nMobile terminated SMS in extended idle mode DRX or in PSM can be achieved via different deployment options depending on operator needs:\n-\tDeployment Option 1:\n-\tBased on MME rejection of paging message from MSC/VLR with no impact to SMS-GMSC.\n-\tDeployment Option 2:\n-\tBased on deployment Option 1, with additional optimization for avoiding additional signalling to HLR/HSS, consisting on signalling and handling of Maximum Retransmission Time.\n-\tDeployment Option 3:\n-\tThe supervision timers to acknowledge receipt of the SMS message at the SMS-GMSC and at the MSC/VLR may be configured by the operator with a value (e.g. 45 minutes) longer than the maximum possible extended idle mode DRX cycle allowed in the network and the maximum possible time that the network allows the UE to continue to remain in power saving state.\n8.2.4a.2\tProcedure for Deployment Option1 and Deployment Option 2\nThe sequence flow described in Figure 8.2.4a.2-1 shows the delivery of mobile terminating SMS when the UE is using extended idle mode DRX with a DRX cycle value, or when the UE is in Power Saving Mode (as defined in TS 23.682 [48]) that can cause mobile terminating SMS retransmissions for Deployment Option 1. It also shows the additional optimizations in case of Deployment Option 2.\nFigure 8.2.4a.2-1: Mobile terminating SMS in extended idle mode DRX (Deployment Options 1 and 2)\n1.\tThe combined EPS/IMSI attach procedure as described in clause 5.2 has been performed, and extended Idle mode DRX has been negotiated.\n2 4.\tThe SC initiates transfer of mobile terminating SMS. The HLR is requested for routing number for SMS services and the SMS message is forwarded to the MSC/VLR where the MS/UE is CS attached. The SMS-GMSC may include in case of Deployment Option 2 the Maximum Retransmission Time in the Forward Short Message to indicate that it is capable to retransmit the Short Message until a maximum retransmission time.\n5.\tThe MSC/VLR sends a Paging (IMSI, VLR TMSI, Location Information, SMS indicator, in Deployment Option 2, SM Delivery Timer, SM Delivery Start Time) message to the MME. For Deployment Option 2, if the Forward Short Message received from the SMS-GMSC includes the Maximum Retransmission Time IE, the VLR should forward the received Maximum Retransmission Time IE in the Paging message to indicate to the MME that the SMS GMSC is capable to retransmit the Short Message until the indicated maximum retransmission time. In Deployment Option 2, if the Forward Short Message received from the SMS-GMSC includes the SM Delivery Timer and SM Delivery Start Time IEs, the VLR may include these IEs in the Paging message to indicate to the MME the time until which the VLR supports buffering the Short Message.\n6a.\tIf the UE is considered unreachable for paging (as specified in TS 23.682 [48]), the MME sends UE unreachable message (cause that indicates UE Temporarily Unreachable and for Deployment Option 2 Requested Retransmission Time, SM Buffer Request Indicator) to the MSC/VLR.\nFor UEs using extended idle mode DRX, the MME proceeds with step 6a, steps 6b-14 as shown in Figure 8.2.4a.2-1 and described below are performed.\nFor UEs in Power Saving Mode, the MME proceeds with step 6a, steps 7a-9, and steps 11-14 as shown in Figure 8.2.4a.2-1 and described below are performed.\nFor Deployment Option 2, if the UE is using a power saving mechanism such as extended idle mode DRX or Power Saving Mode and the Paging message includes the Maximum Retransmission Time IEs, the MME may return an UE Unreachable message to that VLR with the cause UE Temporarily Unreachable and with the Requested Retransmission Time IE requesting the SMS GMSC to retransmit the Short Message at a later time prior to the Maximum Retransmission Time. In that case, the MME shall set the NEAF, so as to notify the VLR of any subsequent UE activity prior to the requested SM retransmission time.\nIn Deployment Option 2, if the UE is using extended idle mode DRX or PSM and the Paging message includes the SM Delivery Timer and SM Delivery Start Time IEs, and if the UE is expected to respond to paging after the paging guard timer but before the time indicated by the SM-Delivery-Timer and SM-Delivery-Start-Time IEs, the MME should page the UE and return an UE Unreachable message to that VLR with cause UE Temporarily Unreachable and with the SM Buffer Request Indicator to request the VLR to buffer the Short Message.\nIn Deployment Option 2, if the VLR included the SM-Delivery-Timer and SM-Delivery-Start-Time IEs in the Paging message, and if the UE Unreachable message indicates a request to buffer the Short Message in the VLR, the VLR shall buffer the Short Message until the time indicated in the Paging message or until receipt of any earlier SGs Service Request message. Steps 7a-9 and 12-14 are not performed.\nOtherwise, if the UE is considered reachable for paging, steps 6-16 of clause 8.2.4 are performed.\n6b.\tThe MME sends the paging request just before the occurrence of next paging occasion. This step is not performed for UEs in PSM.\nNOTE:\tSteps 7-9 are as per legacy behaviour of MT SMS delivery failure as defined in TS 23.040 [14].\n7.\tThe MSC/VLR sends a failure report to the SMSC-GMSC with an Absent Subscriber indication as defined in TS 23.040 [14]. For Deployment Option 2, if the UE Unreachable message includes the Requested Retransmission Time IE, the VLR shall forward the received Requested Retransmission Time IE in the Failure Report to the SMS-GMSC. In that case, the MSC/VLR shall not set the MNRF flag, and steps 8-9 and 12-13 are not performed.\n7a.\tThe MSC/VLR shall, in parallel with step 8, set its MNRF and send an SGs interface Alert Request message to the MME, as described in clause 8.2.5c. The MME shall set the NEAF so as to notify the MSC/VLR of any subsequent UE activity.\n8.\tWhen the SMS-GMSC receives the absent subscriber indication from MSC/VLR it sends an SM-DeliveryReportStatus with absent subscriber indication to HSS in order to be notified when the UE becomes reachable, according to TS 23.040 [14].\n9.\tThe SMS-GMSC, in parallel with step 8, sends a failure report to the SC, according to TS 23.040 [14].\n10.\tThe MS/UE is paged by the eNodeBs. This step is not performed for UEs in PSM.\n11.\tThe UE sends a Service Request message to the MME. The UE indicates its S-TMSI in the RRC signalling. The MME sends the S1-AP Initial Context Setup Request message to the eNodeB and the eNodeB establishes the Radio Bearers. The network should ensure the UE is connected long enough that it allows the SC to reattempt to deliver the MT SMS message while the UE is still active. If the UE and the MME accept to use Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation, then to enable SMS transfer, the Service Request procedures defined in TS 23.401 [2] are not used, but instead UE and MME shall use Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation procedure defined in TS 23.401 [2].\nFor UEs in PSM, Service Request, or Data Transport in Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation or Tracking Area Update, as defined TS  23.401 [2], is performed when the UE wakes up from its power saving state.\n12.\tThe MME sends UE-Activity-Indication (IMSI) to the MSC/VLR. For Deployment Option 2, if the UE is using a power saving mechanism (such as extended idle mode DRX or PSM), the MME includes the Maximum UE Availability Time IE in the UE-Activity-Indication message to indicate the time until which the UE is expected to be reachable.\n12a.\tThe MSC/VLR sends Ready-For-SM Service to the HLR. For Deployment Option 2, the MSC/VLR includes this information to the HLR if received in step 12.\n13.\tThe HLR initiates Alert-SC function towards the SC as defined in TS 23.040 [14]. For Deployment Option 2, the HLR includes the Maximum UE Availability Time IE in the Alert-SC if received at step 12a.\n14.\tThe SC initiates a new attempt to deliver the MT SMS according to clause 8.2.5. For Deployment Option 2, the SC prioritizes the retransmission of pending Mobile Terminated Short Messages to UEs using a power saving mechanism, i.e. UEs known to have a Maximum UE Availability Time.\n8.2.4a.3\tProcedure for Deployment Option 3\nThe following sequence flow described in Figure 8.2.4a.3-1 shows the delivery of mobile terminating SMS when the UE is using extended idle mode DRX (as defined in TS 23.682 [48]) with a DRX cycle value, or when the UE is using PSM, that can cause mobile terminating SMS retransmissions for Deployment Option 3.\nFigure 8.2.4a.3-1: Mobile terminating SMS in extended idle mode DRX (Deployment Option 3)\n1-5.\tSteps 1-5 as described in clause 8.2.4 are performed.\n6a.\tIf the UE is considered unreachable for paging due to using extended idle mode DRX or PSM (as specified in TS 23.682 [48]), the MME sends a Service Request message to the MSC/VLR. If the MME proceeds with step 6a, steps 6b-16 as shown in Figure 8.2.4a.3-1 and described below are performed.\nOtherwise steps 6-16 of clause 8.2.4 are performed.\n6b.\tThe MSC/VLR builds the SMS message to be sent as defined in TS 23.040 [14] (i.e. the SMS message consists of CP DATA/RP DATA/TPDU/SMS DELIVER parts). The MSC/VLR forwards the SMS message to the MME in a Downlink Unitdata message. The MME stores the received SMS message.\n7a.\tThe MME sends the paging request just before the occurrence of next paging occasion. This step is not performed for UEs in PSM.\n7b.\tThe MS/UE is paged by the eNodeBs. This step is not performed for UEs in PSM.\n8.\tThe UE sends a Service Request message to the MME. The UE indicates its S TMSI in the RRC signalling. The MME sends the S1-AP Initial Context Setup Request message to the eNodeB and the eNodeB establishes the Radio Bearers. If the UE and the MME accept to use Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation, then to enable SMS transfer the Service Request procedures defined in TS 23.401 [2] are not used, but instead UE and MME shall use Data Transport in Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation procedure defined in TS 23.401 [2].\nFor UEs in PSM, Service Request, or Data Transport in Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation or Tracking Area Update, as defined TS 23.401 [2] is performed when the UE wakes up from its power saving state.\n9.\tThe MME encapsulates the SMS message in a NAS message and sends the message to the MS/UE.\n9c-16.\tSteps 9c-16 as described in clause 8.2.4 are performed.",

      "content": "Mobile terminating SMS in Active Mode procedure is specified by reusing the Mobile Terminating SMS in Idle Mode with the following modification:\n-\tThere is no need for the MME to perform Paging of the MS/UE after step 5. MME continues with step 8a (i.e. steps 6 to 8 are skipped). The MME immediately sends a Downlink Unitdata to the UE.\n-\tThe MME also includes the E-CGI and TAI in step 9d.\n8.2.5a\tMultiple Mobile terminating SMSs\nIn clause 3.2 of TS 24.011 [28], the simultaneous transmission of more than one MT SMS per domain is prohibited.\nIf the MSC/VLR has more than one SMS to send, the subsequent SMS is sent in a Downlink Unitdata message after step 14 and instead of the Release Request in step 16 of clause 8.2.4. i.e. the MSC/VLR does not need to send another SGs Paging message.\n8.2.5b\tSimultaneous Mobile terminating and Mobile originating SMSs\nThe above clauses on mobile originating and mobile terminating SMS handling in active and idle mode can be reused such that no special treatment is needed for this case.\n8.2.5c\tUnsuccessful Mobile terminating SMS delivery attempt\nAs specified in clause 3.2.8 of TS 23.040 [14], setting the Mobile Station Not Reachable Flag (MNRF) in the MSC/VLR is mandatory. However, when using the SGs interface, the MSC/VLR has delegated the 'implicit detach' functionality to the MME (and/or, if Network Mode of Operation 1 is in use in GERAN/UTRAN, to the SGSN).\nIf an SGs based MT SMS delivery attempt fails, the MSC/VLR shall set its MNRF and send an SGs interface Alert Request message to the MME. Upon receipt of Alert Request message, MME shall set its Non-EPS Alert Flag (NEAF) and if ISR is activated, the MME shall then send an S3 interface Alert-MME-Request message to the SGSN. SGSN shall set the S3 SMS Alert Flag (SSAF).\nIf the MME operator knows (e.g. because it is in the HPLMN) that the receiving UE's HPLMN deploys SMS-Router, and if the receiving UE's HPLMN uses both SMS via MSC and SMS via SGSN, then the MME need not send the Alert-MME-Request message to the SGSN for that UE.\nNOTE:\tThe receiving UE's HPLMN should ensure that the SMS-Router in the receiving UE's HPLMN only returns SMS-Router address to the SMS-GMSC of the sender UE's PLMN.\nSubsequently, if the UE makes radio contact with the SGSN and SSAF is set, the SGSN informs the MME with an S3 interface UE-Activity-Indication. Upon receipt of the S3 interface UE-Activity-Indication, or, if the UE makes radio contact with the MME, the MME sends an SGs AP UE-Activity-Indication message to the MSC/VLR. Upon receipt of an SGs AP UE-Activity-Indication message, or signalling on the A, Iu-cs or Gs interface for that UE, the MSC/VLR shall inform the HLR.\nFor Deployment Option 2, if the UE is using a power saving mechanism (such as extended idle mode DRX), the MME may include the Maximum UE Availability Time IE in the SGs AP UE-Activity-Indication message to indicate the time until which the UE is expected to be reachable. This information may be used by the SMS Service Center to prioritize the retransmission of pending Mobile Terminated Short Messages to UEs using a power saving mechanism.\n8.2.5d\tNon-SMS Mobile terminating activity during SMS delivery\nWhile one or more SMS is being transferred, other mobile terminating requests (e.g. an MT voice call) may arrive in the MSC/VLR. If this happens the MSC/VLR continues the SMS activities but shall also send the SGs Paging message for the non-SMS activity to the MME. The MME shall handle this SGs Paging message as if no SMS transfers are ongoing. Typically this should lead to the MME invoking the handover/call redirection to GERAN/UTRAN features and it may lead to disruption of the SMS delivery. The MSC/VLR and UE shall recover from any such SMS disruption using the normal RP and CP layer retransmission timers/mechanisms.\n8.2.5e\tNon-SMS Mobile originating activity during SMS delivery\nWhile one or more SMS is being transferred, other mobile originating requests (e.g. an MO voice call or USSD) may be requested by the user. If this happens the MS/UE continues the SMS activities but shall also send the Extended Service Request message for the non-SMS activity to the MME. The MME shall handle this Extended Service Request message as if no SMS transfers are ongoing. Typically this should lead to the MME invoking the handover/call redirection to GERAN/UTRAN features and it may lead to disruption of the SMS delivery. The MSC/VLR and UE shall recover from any such SMS disruption using the normal RP and CP layer retransmission timers/mechanisms.\n8.2.5f\tMobile Terminating SMS when ISR is active and SGs is active between MSC/VLR and MME\nWhen the MME receives the SGs Paging message for SMS, and ISR is active, and the UE is in idle mode, the MME sends the S1 interface paging message to the E‑UTRAN (using the S-TMSI as temporary identity) and sends a CS paging message (SMS indicator) to the SGSN using the MSC TMSI as temporary identity (unless the MSC did not allocate a TMSI, in which case the IMSI is used for paging).\nThe UE is paged on E‑UTRAN and by the SGSN on GERAN and/or UTRAN. For GERAN A/Gb mode, the SGSN sends a PAGING CS message to the BSS (see TS 48.018 [30]) if \"SMS in SGSN\" is not used for this UE. For UTRAN, the SGSN sends a PAGING message to the UTRAN (see TS 25.413 [29]) with the CN Domain Indicator set to 'CS domain' and the Paging Cause set to 'Terminating Low Priority Signalling' if \"SMS in SGSN\" is not used for this UE. The UE responds on the cell on which it is camped. When camped on E-UTRAN, the UE responds to the MME. When camped on GERAN or UTRAN, the UE responds to the MSC.",

UEs with single Rx configuration are not able to camp in 1xRTT when they are active in E-UTRAN. The network therefore provides mechanisms for the UE to perform registration to 1xRTT, receive 1xRTT paging, SMS etc. while the UE is in E-UTRAN. UEs with dual Rx configuration can camp in 1xRTT while they are active in E-UTRAN, they may however not be able to stay in E-UTRAN when they handle a CS call and/or perform registration signalling, and/or sending or receiving SMS in 1xRTT.\nClause B.1 and B.2 describes the architecture and procedures for CS Fallback (and enhanced CS Fallback) to 1xRTT when the UE has single Rx, dual Rx, or dual Rx/Tx configuration. In this scenario the network need to support the S102 interface between the MME and 1xCS system in order to support CS Fallback (this is indicated by the presence of CSFB registration parameters on E-UTRAN broadcast channel, TS 36.331 [33]).\nClause B.3 describes the procedures for CS Fallback when the UE has dual Rx configuration. In this scenario the network needs to support the Extended Service Request procedure in order to support CS Fallback (this is indicated by either the presence of CSFB registration parameters or indication of support for dual rx CSFB on E-UTRAN broadcast channel, TS 36.331 [33]).\nIf the UE has a dual Rx configuration and indicates support for enhanced CS fallback to 1xRTT in the UE radio capabilities, the principles and procedures in clauses B.1 and B.2 are followed when the network indicates support for S102.\nB.1\tOverall Description\nB.1.1\tGeneral Considerations\nThe CS fallback for 1xRTT in EPS enables the delivery of CS-domain services (e.g. CS voice) by reuse of the 1xCS infrastructure when the UE is served by E-UTRAN. A CS fallback enabled terminal, while connected to E-UTRAN may register in the 1x RTT CS domain in order to be able to use 1xRTT access to establish one or more CS services in the CS domain. The CS Fallback function is only available where E-UTRAN coverage overlaps with 1xRTT coverage.\nThis specification also specifies the architecture required for SMS over S102 in EPS. The MO SMS and MT SMS are tunnelled in EPS and over S102 and do not cause any CS Fallback to CDMA 1xRTT, and consequently does not require any overlapped CDMA 1xRTT coverage.\nCS Fallback to 1xRTT and IMS-based services shall be able to co-exist in the same operator's network.\nCS Fallback to 1xRTT with PS Handover procedure to HRPD access for Optimised HO, non-Optimised HO, and Optimised Idle mode mobility as defined in TS 23.402 [27] shall be able to co-exist in the same operator's network.\nB.1.2\tReference Architecture\nThe CS fallback to 1xRTT and SMS over S102 in EPS function is realised by reusing the S102 reference point between the MME and the 1xCS IWS. The reference architecture described in figure B.1.2‑1 is similar to the SRVCC architecture for E‑UTRAN to 3GPP2 1xCS described in TS 23.216 [20], with the additional aspect that the S102 session is long‑lived (similar to pre‑registration for S101).\nFigure B.1.2-1: Reference architecture for CS fallback to 1xRTT CS\nReference architecture for PS handover procedure between E-UTRAN and HRPD access is defined in TS 23.402 [27].\nB.1.2.1\tReference points\nS102:\tIt is the reference point between the MME and the 1xCS IWS. The S102 reference point provides a tunnel between MME and 3GPP2 1xCS IWS to relay 3GPP2 1xCS signalling messages. 1x CS signalling messages are those messages that are defined for A21 interface as described in 3GPP2 A.S0008-C [16] and 3GPP2 A.S0009 [17].\nB.1.3\tFunctional entities\nB.1.3.1\tUE\nThe UE capable of CS fallback to 1xRTT and SMS over S102 supports access to E-UTRAN/EPC as well as access to the 1xCS domain over 1xRTT. It supports the following additional functions:\n-\t1xRTT CS registration over the EPS after the UE has completed the E-UTRAN attachment;\n-\t1xRTT CS re-registration due to mobility;\n-\tCS fallback procedures specified for 1xRTT CS domain voice service;\n-\tProcedures for mobile originated and mobile terminated SMS tunnelled over EPS and S102;\n-\tIncludes enhanced CS fallback to 1xRTT capability indication as part of the UE radio capabilities;\n-\tIncludes concurrent 1xRTT and HRPD capability indication as part of the UE radio capabilities if supported by the enhanced CS fallback to 1xRTT capable UE.\nIf the UE is service user with subscription to CS domain priority service, the UE's USIM belongs to one of the special Access Classes as specified in TS 22.011 [38] and the UE shall set the RRC establishment cause to \"HighPriorityAccess\" as specified in TS 36.331 [33].\nB.1.3.2\tMME\nThe MME enabled for CS fallback to 1xRTT supports the following additional functions:\n-\tIt serves as a signalling tunnelling end point towards the 3GPP2 1xCS IWS via S102 interface for sending/receiving encapsulated 3GPP2 1xCS signalling messages to/from the UE, which are encapsulated in S1-MME S1 Information Transfer messages, as defined in TR 36.938 [19];\n-\t1xCS-IWS (terminating S102 reference point) selection for CSFB procedures;\n-\tHandling of S102 tunnel redirection in case of MME relocation;\n-\tBuffering of messages received via S102 for UEs in idle state.\nIf the network supports CSFB priority call handling, the MME supports the following additional functions:\n-\tFor page message received on the S102 interface with priority indication, the MME provides preferential treatment to this message and also the subsequent CS fallback procedure compared to other normal transactions. If UE needs to be paged, the MME sets priority indication on the paging request to eNodeB. The MME also sets priority indication, i.e. \"CSFB High Priority\", in S1AP message to the eNodeB, so that eNodeB may initiate the CSFB procedure with priority, as specified in TS 36.413 [35].\n-\tFor a CSFB request from service user, the MME determines that the CSFB request need priority handling based on the UE's EPS subscription information. The MME in congestion situation provides preferential treatment to this request and also sets priority indication, i.e. \"CSFB High Priority\", in S1AP message to eNodeB to initiate CSFB procedure, as specified in TS 36.413 [35].\nB.1.3.3\tE-UTRAN\nThe E‑UTRAN enabled for CS fallback to 1xRTT supports the following additional functions:\n-\tProvision of control information that causes the UE to trigger 1xCS registration;\n-\tForwarding 1x RTT CS paging request to the UE;\n-\tForwarding 1x RTT CS related messages between MME and UE;\n-\tRelease of E-UTRAN resources after UE leaves E-UTRAN coverage subsequent to a page for CS fallback to 1xRTT CS if PS handover procedure is not performed in conjunction with 1xCS fallback;\n-\tInvoking the optimised or non-optimised PS handover procedure concurrently with enhanced 1xCS fallback procedure when supported by the network and UE, and based on network configuration.\nIf the network supports CSFB priority call handling, the E-UTRAN supports the following additional functions:\n-\tFor page message received on S1AP with priority indication, the E-UTRAN should provide preferential treatment to this request compared to other normal paging requests.\n-\tFor CS fallback S1AP message with priority indication and if the UE is idle, the E-UTRAN should provide preferential treatment in allocating E-UTRAN radio bearer resources compared to other normal resource requests. Also, E-UTRAN shall not trigger enhanced 1xCSFB with concurrent optimized PS handover to HRPD access.\nB.1.4\tCo-existence with IMS services\nClause 4.5 of this specification also applies here.\nB.1.5\tCSFB Priority Call Handling\nPriority call handling support for CSFB ensures that end-to-end priority handling is provided for both mobile originated CSFB calls by a service user in E-UTRAN and for mobile terminated CSFB call from a service user to a normal or service user in E-UTRAN. A service user's EPS subscription information contains an indication of the users 1xRTT CS domain priority status, i.e. a MPS CS priority. If the UE is subscribed to CS domain priority, the UE's USIM shall belong to one of special Access Classes as specified in TS 22.011 [38].\nFor mobile terminated CS fallback calls from a service user, the 1x MSC via the 1xCS IWS provides a priority indication to the MME along with a page message. The MME shall set a priority indication to the eNodeB when requesting the eNodeB to page the UE if the UE is idle. If the MME, while waiting for a UE response to the paging request sent without priority indication, receives a message with priority indication from the 1xCS MSC via 1xCS IWS, the MME should send another paging request with priority indication. For mobile originated CS fallback calls from a service user in E-UTRAN, the MME determines that the CSFB requires priority handling based on the MPS CS priority in the UE's EPS subscription. For both mobile originated and mobile terminated CSFB, the MME shall also provide priority indication, i.e. \"CSFB High Priority\", when requesting the eNodeB to execute the CSFB priority procedure. The eNodeB should handle the page message with priority and also prioritize the subsequent CS fallback procedure to 1xRTT as specified in TS 36.413 [35].\nB.2\tProcedures\nB.2.1\tMobility Management\nB.2.1.1\t1x RTT CS Pre-Registration over EPS Procedure\nThis clause describes how the UE in an E-UTRAN system establishes and maintains pre-registration in the 1xCS system.\nFigure B.2.1.1-1: 1xRTT CS registration procedure\n1.\tThe UE attaches to E-UTRAN as specified in TS 23.401 [2]. The UE includes an indication of enhanced CS fallback to 1xRTT and may also include concurrent 1xRTT and HRPD PS session handling capabilities as part of the UE radio capabilities.\nIf the UE is a service user with subscription to 1x priority service in the 1xRTT CS domain, the UE's EPS subscription contains MPS CS priority.\n2.\tBased on a radio layer trigger (e.g. an indication from the E-UTRAN when the UE is in connected state or an indication over the broadcast channel), the UE decides to register with the 1xRTT CS domain.\n3.\tIf the UE is in idle state, in order to create a signalling connection with the MME, it performs the Service Request procedure.\n4.\tThe UE generates a 1xRTT CS registration request.\n4a.\tThe 1xRTT CS message is transferred from the UE to E-UTRAN.\n4b.\tE-UTRAN forwards the 1xRTT CS message to the MME including the CDMA2000 Reference Cell ID.\n4c.\tThe MME selects a 1xCS IWS node based on the CDMA2000 Reference Cell ID. The IMSI is used to distinguish S102 signalling transactions belonging to different UEs. The MME sends a S102 Direct Transfer message (IMSI, 1xCS message) to the 1xCS IWS node.\n5.\t1xRTT CS registration is then performed by the 1xCS IWS node based on 3GPP2 A.S0008 [16].\n6a.\t1xRTT CS registration response is tunnelled back to the MME in a S102 Direct Transfer message (IMSI, 1xCS message).\n6b.\tThe MME forwards the 1xRTT CS message to the E-UTRAN.\n6c.\tThe E-UTRAN forwards the 1xRTT CS message to the UE.\nIf the triggers for 1xCS registration change over time, the UE (both in idle or connected state), uses this information to update the 1xCS registration via the tunnel.\nB.2.1.2\tS102 Tunnel Redirection\nS102 Tunnel Redirection Procedure is used when the UE perform Tracking Area Update with MME change while the UE is registered with the 1xRTT CS domain as described in clause B.2.1.1 and the S102 session exists between the MME and the 1xCS IWS.\nThe detail procedure for the idle case is depicted as figure B.2.1.2-1.\nFigure B.2.1.2-1: S102 tunnel redirection during TAU with MME change\n1.\tUE performs 1x-registration over the source MME while in ECM-CONNECTED state, followed by transition to ECM-IDLE state. The S102 tunnel exists between the source MME and the 1xCS IWS.\n2.\tTAU procedure with MME change as described in TS 23.401 [2], figure 5.3.3.1-1, up to and including the step where the target MME receives Update Location Ack from the HSS, is executed. The 1xCS IWS ID is transferred to the target MME via the Context Response message.\n3.\tThe target MME sends S102 Redirection Command message to the 1xCS IWS. After receiving this message, the 1xCS IWS associates the S102 tunnel for this specific UE with the target MME. Then the 1xCS IWS releases any context associated with the source MME.\n4.\tIn response to the S102 Redirection Command message, the 1xCS IWS sends a S102 Redirection Ack message to the target MME.\n5.\tThe TAU procedure is completed.\nThe detailed procedure for the active case is depicted as figure B.2.1.2-2.\nFigure B.2.1.2-2: S102 tunnel redirection during inter-eNodeB handover with MME relocation\n1.\tUE performs 1x-registration over the source MME while in ECM-CONNECTED state. The S102 tunnel exists between the source MME and the 1xCS IWS.\n2.\tInter-eNodeB handover with MME relocation procedure as described in TS 23.401 [2], figure 5.5.1.2.2-1, steps prior to TAU, is executed. The 1xCS IWS ID is transferred to the target MME via the Forward Relocation Request message.\n3.\tThe target MME sends S102 Redirection Command message to the 1xCS IWS. After receiving this message, the 1xCS IWS associates the S102 tunnel with the target MME. Then the 1xCS IWS releases any context associated with the source MME.\n4.\tIn response to the S102 Redirection Command message, the 1xCS IWS sends a S102 Redirection Ack message to the target MME.\n5.\tThe TAU procedure occurs.\nB.2.1.3\tUE-initiated Detach Procedure\nIf a 1xRTT CS Fallback UE, pre-registered to the 1xRTT CS system, initiates the detach procedure in E-UTRAN access due to switch off and the UE is required to perform a \"power-down registration\" in the 1xRTT CS system (see C.S0005‑A [32]), the UE shall first perform the \"power-down registration\" procedure with the 1xRTT CS system via the S102 tunnel, before initiating the detach procedure in E-UTRAN access as specified in TS 23.401 [2].\nA 1xCSF UE, pre-registered to the 1xCS system, performing detach due to reasons other than switch off is not required to perform \"power-down registration\" with the 1xCS system prior to performing the detach procedure in E-UTRAN.\nB.2.2\tMobile Originating Call in Active Mode\nThis clause describes the mobile originating call procedures for the CS Fallback to 1xRTT in the normal case. For enhanced CS fallback to 1xRTT procedure, see clause B.2.3a. Clause B.2.3b describes the procedure when the procedure is rejected by the MME.\nFigure B.2.2-1: CS MO call using fallback to CDMA 1x RTT network\n1.\tUE is E‑UTRAN attached and registered with 1xRTT CS as defined in clause B.2.1.1.\n2.\tUE makes a decision to perform a mobile originated CS call.\n3.\tUE sends an Extended Service Request for mobile originating 1xCS fallback to the MME.\n4.\tMME sends UE Context Modification Request (CS Fallback Indicator, priority indicator) to E-UTRAN. CS Fallback Indicator indicates to the E‑UTRAN to move the UE to 1xRTT.\nIf MME determines the CS Fallback procedure needs priority handling based on the MPS CS priority in the UE's EPS subscription, it sets priority indication in the S1AP message to the E-UTRAN. E-UTRAN responds with UE Context Modification Response\n5.\tE-UTRAN may optionally solicit a 1xRTT measurement report from the UE to determine the target 1xRTT cell to which the CS Fallback will be performed.\n6a.\tThe E-UTRAN triggers RRC connection release with redirection to 1xCS and continue with step 7.\n7.\tE-UTRAN sends an S1 UE Context Release Request (Cause) message to the MME. Cause indicates that the S1 UE Context Release was caused by CS fallback to 1xRTT.\nIn case the Cause indicates that RRC was released due to abnormal conditions, e.g. radio link failure, the MME should continue with steps 8 -10.\n8.\tThe MME deactivates GBR bearers towards S-GW and P-GW(s) by initiating MME-initiated Dedicated Bearer Deactivation procedure as specified in TS 23.401 [2], and starts the preservation and suspension of non-GBR bearers by sending Suspend Notification message to the S-GW. The S-GW releases all eNodeB related information (address and TEIDs) for the UE, and sends Suspend Notification message to the P-GW(s).\n9.\tS-GW and P-GW(s) acknowledges the bearer updates by responding with Suspend Acknowledge. The MME stores in the UE context that UE is in suspended status. All the preserved non-GBR bearers are marked as suspended status in S-GW and P-GW. The P-GW discards downlink data if the UE is marked as suspended.\n10.\tS1 UE Context in the E-UTRAN is released as specified in TS 23.401 [2].\n11.\tUE moves to 1xRTT and performs the procedure for mobile originating call as specified in 3GPP2 A.S0013 [18].\nOnce CS service ends in the 1xCS domain, the UE returns to E‑UTRAN by performing reselection. The EPS service is resumed as described in clause 6.5.\nB.2.2a\tMobile Originating call in Idle Mode\nMobile Originating call in Idle Mode procedure is specified by reusing the Mobile Originating Call in Active mode procedure with Extended Service Request for mobile originating 1xCS fallback to the MME where the messages S1-AP UE context Modification Request and Response are replaced by S1-AP Initial UE Context Request and Response. UE is transited to ECM-CONNECTED mode by following the applicable procedures specified in TS 23.401 [2].\nIf UE has only LIPA PDN connection and the cell accessed by the UE does not link to the L-GW where the UE had the LIPA PDN Connection, the MME shall reject the Extended Service Request with a reason code which results in the UE selecting 1xRTT access as specified in TS 24.301 [34].\nIf the UE has only SIPTO at the Local Network PDN connections:\n(i)\tin a network with collocated L-GW deployment and the (H)eNB accessed by the UE is not collocated with the L-GW providing the SIPTO at the Local Network connectivity; or\n(ii)\tin a network with stand-alone GW deployment and the (H)eNB accessed by the UE is not connected to the Local Network where the stand-alone GW (with S-GW and L-GW collocated) providing the SIPTO at the Local Network connectivity is residing,\nthe MME shall reject the Extended Service Request with an appropriate cause value which results in the UE selecting 1xRTT access.\nIf the UE has only SIPTO at the Local Network PDN connections and LIPA PDN connections, where:\n-\tthe SIPTO at the Local Network PDN connections fulfil criterion (i) or (ii) above; and\n-\tthe cell accessed by the UE does not link to the L-GW where the UE had the LIPA PDN connection,\nthe MME shall also reject the Extended Service Request with an appropriate cause value which results in the UE selecting 1xRTT access.\nIf the UE is a service user with subscription to CS domain priority service, the UE's USIM shall belong to one of special Access Classes as specified in TS 22.011 [38] and sets the RRC establishment cause to \"HighPriorityAccess\" as specified in TS 36.331 [33]. If the network supports a priority call handling, the MME determines that the Extended Service Request requires priority handling of CS Fallback based on the \"HighPriorityAccess\" establishment cause forwarded by eNodeB to the MME and/or MPS CS priority in the UE's EPS subscription. According to operator policy, the MME may use MPS CS priority to verify the priority handling of the CS Fallback procedure.\nIf MME decides to perform CS Fallback with priority, it sets priority indication in the S1-AP Initial UE Context Request message to the eNodeB. The eNodeB should allocate radio bearer resources to the UE preferentially compared to other normal calls.\nB.2.3\tMobile Terminating Call\nThis clause describes the mobile terminating call procedures when the UE accepts or rejects CS paging for the CS Fallback to 1xRTT, in the normal case. Clause B.2.3b describes the procedure when the procedure is rejected by the MME.\nWhen the 1x MSC receives a registration from a UE, it makes note of the RAN equipment from which it received the registration. Subsequent paging activities may thus be directed toward that RAN equipment. However, paging activities by the 1xMSC are not limited to the single RAN equipment from which the registration was received. The MSC may choose to page a wider area, including inter‑system paging. If the 1xMSC has direct interfaces to 1xCS IWS, as well as to 1xRTT access, the MSC may choose to do direct paging activities to both E‑UTRAN and 1x RAN equipments in its attempts to contact the UE.\nThe 1x paging request sent by the 1xMSC to the 1xCS IWS is delivered to the UE via the tunnel. The UE tunes to 1xRTT access, acknowledges the 1x page and performs the 1xCS procedures for mobile terminated call.\nThe detailed procedure using RRC connection release with redirection to 1xCS is described in figure B.2.3‑1. For enhanced 1xRTT CS Fall Back procedure, see clause B.2.3a.\nFigure B.2.3-1: CS MT call using fallback to CDMA 1x RTT network\n1.\tUE is E-UTRAN attached and pre-registered with 1xRTT CS as defined in clause B.2.1.1.\n2.\t1xMSC sends a paging request to the 1xCS IWS node with Caller Line Identification if available.\nIf the call is originated by a priority user or an emergency callback from PSAP, the paging request message from the 1xRTT MSC to the IWS contains a priority value or an emergency indicator, respectively, as specified in 3GPP2 specification A.S0008-C v3.0 [39] / A.S0009-C v3.0 [40].\n3.\t1xCS IWS node forwards the 1x RTT CS paging request via the S102 tunnel to the MME.\nIf a priority value or emergency indication was received in the previous step, the S102 message also reflects the same.\n4.\tIf the UE is in idle state, the MME performs the network initiated Service Request procedure in order to bring the UE to active state prior to tunnelling of the 1x RTT CS paging request toward the UE. The paging is performed using S-TMSI with CN domain indicator set to \"PS\".\nIf the S102 message contains a priority value or emergency indication, the MME also sets priority indication in the S1AP paging request message to the E-UTRAN. The E-UTRAN handles the paging process with priority.\n5.\tMME forwards the 1xRTT CS paging request to the UE.\n6a.\tVoid.\n6b.\tIf the UE accepts CS paging for the CS Fallback to 1xRTT, the UE sends an Extended Service Request for mobile terminating 1xCS fallback to the MME and proceeds with step 7 to step 15 below.\n7.\tMME sends UE Context Modification Request (CS Fallback Indicator) to indicate the E‑UTRAN to move the UE to 1xRTT.\nIf priority value or emergency indication was received in Step 3, the MME also sets priority indication to the E-UTRAN in UE Context Modification Request. The E-UTRAN provides preferential treatment to this call in the subsequent steps. E-UTRAN responds with UE Context Modification Response.\n8.\tE-UTRAN may optionally solicit a 1xRTT measurement report from the UE to determine the target 1xRTT cell to which the CS Fallback will be performed.\n9.\tE-UTRAN triggers RRC connection release with redirection to 1xCS.\n10.\tE-UTRAN sends an S1 UE Context Release Request (Cause) message to the MME. Cause indicates that the S1 UE Context Release was caused by CS fallback to 1xRTT.\n11.\tThe MME deactivates GBR bearers towards S-GW and P-GW(s) by initiating MME-initiated Dedicated Bearer Deactivation procedure as specified in TS 23.401 [2], and starts the preservation and suspension of non-GBR bearers by sending Suspend Notification message to the S-GW. The S-GW releases all eNodeB related information (address and TEIDs) for the UE, and sends Suspend Notification message to the P-GW(s).\n12.\tS-GW and P-GW(s) acknowledges the bearer updates by responding with Suspend Acknowledge. The MME stores in the UE context that UE is in suspended status. All the preserved non-GBR bearers are marked as suspended status in S-GW and P-GW. The P-GW discards downlink data if the UE is marked as suspended.\n13.\tS1 UE Context in the E-UTRAN is released as specified in TS 23.401 [2].\n14.\tUE tunes to 1xRTT and acknowledges the page by transmitting a 1xRTT Paging Response message over the 1x Access Channel.\n15.\tSubsequently UE performs the procedure for mobile terminated call establishment as specified in 3GPP2 A.S0013 [18].\nOnce CS service ends in the 1xCS domain the UE returns to E-UTRAN by performing reselection. The EPS service is resumed as described in clause 6.5.\nB.2.3a\tEnhanced CS fallback to 1xRTT Procedure\nB.2.3a.1\tGeneral\nEnhanced CS fallback to 1xRTT procedure may be used when the UE indicates its support of this capability to the network. If in addition, the UE also indicates its support of concurrent 1xRTT and HRPD PS session handling, this indication also allows the network to invoke optimised or non-optimised PS handover procedure concurrently with the enhanced CS fallback to 1xRTT procedure.\nA network that advertises support for enhanced CS fallback to 1xRTT may also advertise support for UEs with dual 1xRTT and E-UTRAN receiver/transmitter configuration. In such networks, UEs that support enhanced CS fallback to 1xRTT for dual receiver/transmitter configuration may switch off their 1xRTT receiver/transmitter while camped in E-UTRAN and register in the 1xRTT domain via the S102 tunnel. A network advertising these capabilities does not suspend the EPS bearers for mobile originated or mobile terminated 1x CS calls for such UEs. Concurrent enhanced CS fallback to 1xRTT and PS handover to HRPD is not performed for UEs that support enhanced CS fallback to 1xRTT for dual receiver/transmitter configuration.\nIf enhanced CS fallback to 1xRTT procedure is not used by the network (i.e., not supported or not configured), the network uses RRC connection release with redirection as specified in clauses B.2.2 and B.2.3.\nNOTE 1.\tOther 3GPP2 specific procedure (e.g. how UE performs concurrent operation in 3GPP2 network) is outside the scope of this specification.\nNOTE 2.\tE-UTRAN may invoke concurrent optimised active-mode PS handover procedure or non-optimised PS handover procedure when it receives S1-AP: UE Context Modification with CSFB indication, based on UE capability and operator configuration.\nB.2.3a.2\tMobile Originating Call without concurrent PS handover, or with concurrent non-optimised PS handover or optimised idle-mode PS handover\nThe following figure describes the mobile originating call procedures for the enhanced CS Fallback to 1xRTT with concurrent non-optimised PS handover or optimised idle-mode PS handover, or without concurrent PS handover, in the normal case. Clause B.2.3b describes the procedure when the procedure is rejected by the MME.\nFigure B.2.3a.2-1: Enhanced CS fallback to 1xRTT MO Call with no PS handover, or with concurrent non-optimised PS handover or optimised idle-mode PS handover\n1.\tUE is E UTRAN attached and registered with 1xRTT CS as defined in clause B.2.1.1 with enhanced CS fallback to 1xRTT capability indication to E-UTRAN. The UE may also indicate that it supports concurrent 1xRTT and HRPD capability. The UE may also be pre-registered with HRPD access using procedures defined in TS 23.402 [27], clause 9.3.1. The UE may also indicate support of enhanced CS Fallback to 1xRTT for dual receiver/transmitter configuration to E-UTRAN.\n2.\tUE makes a decision to perform a mobile originated CS call.\n3.\tUE sends an Extended Service Request for mobile originating 1xCS fallback to the MME.\n4.\tFor a UE in active mode, MME sends UE Context Modification Request (CS Fallback Indicator) to E-UTRAN. CS Fallback Indicator indicates to the E UTRAN to move the UE to 1xRTT.E-UTRAN responds with UE Context Modification Response.\nFor a UE in idle mode, MME sends Initial UE Context Request (CS Fallback Indicator) to E-UTRAN. CS Fallback Indicator indicates to the E‑UTRAN to move the UE to 1xRTT. E-UTRAN responds with Initial UE Context Response.\nIf MME determines the CS Fallback procedure needs priority handling based on MPS CS priority in the UE's EPS subscription and/or the high priority access indication that the eNodeB includes in the S1AP message in step 3, it sets priority indication as well as CS Fallback indicator in the S1AP message to the eNodeB. According to operator policy the MME may use CS priority indicator to verify the priority handling of the CS Fallback procedure, in the case high priority access indication is received in the S1-AP message. The E-UTRAN, in congestion conditions, provides preferential treatment for this call in the subsequent steps. Also, the E-UTRAN shall not trigger enhanced 1xCSFB with concurrent optimized PS handover to HRPD access.\n5.\tE-UTRAN may optionally solicit a 1xRTT measurement report from the UE to determine the target 1xRTT cell to which the CS Fallback will be performed.\nIf the network supports PS handover procedure to HRPD then E-UTRAN may optionally solicit an HRPD measurement report from the UE to determine whether the target HRPD candidates exist or not.\n6.\tE-UTRAN sends a HandoverFromE-UTRAPreparation Request message to the UE to start the enhanced 1xCS fallback procedure. It includes 3G1x Overhead Parameters and RAND value. This message also includes an indication that concurrent HRPD handover preparation is not required.\nWhen both the network and the UE support enhanced CS Fallback to 1xRTT for dual receiver/transmitter configuration, the E-UTRAN may after Step 4 decide, e.g. due to RF conditions, to direct the UE to turn on its second radio to 1xRTT and retry the 1xCS call directly on the 1xRTT access network. For this case, the E-UTRAN in the HandoverFromE-UTRAPreparation Request message includes a redirection indicator along with optional redirection information. The procedure stops after this step and the UE tunes its 1x radio and retries its 1x call in 1xRTT while still receiving/transmitting data on E‑UTRAN.\n7.\tThe UE initiates signalling for establishment of the CS access leg by sending UL HandoverPreparation Transfer message which contains the 1xRTT Origination message with called party number.\n8.\tMessages between MME and 1xIWS are tunnelled using the S102 interface. The 1xRTT MSC initiates the call with the called party number carried in the 1xRTT Origination message.\n9.\tThe E-UTRAN performs either Step 9a or Step 9b. Step 9b is only performed when both the E-UTRAN and UE support enhanced 1x CS fallback to 1xRTT for dual receiver/transmitter configuration.\n9a.\tThe E UTRAN sends Mobility from EUTRA Command to the UE with indication that this is for enhanced 1x CS Fallback operation, 1xRTT related information, and optionally the HRPD redirection information. The 1xRTT information contains 1xRTT messages related to 1x channel assignment and cause the UE to tune to and acquire this 1x channel. This is perceived by the UE as a Handover Command message to 1xRTT.\n-\tIf the network does not support PS handover procedure to HRPD or if no target HRPD candidates exist then E-UTRAN shall release the S1 UE context (see step 10a/b) after executing the enhanced CS fallback to 1xRTT procedure.\n-\tFor either concurrent non-optimised PS handover procedure or optimised idle-mode PS handover procedure along with enhanced CS fallback to 1xRTT, E-UTRAN may also redirect the UE to HRPD as part of this procedure. This is indicated by the HRPD redirection information in the Mobility from EUTRA Command.\nIf 1xRTT CS network cannot support this CSFB request (for example due to resource availability), the DL information transfer message is sent instead, with an embedded 1x message that indicates failure to the UE. In this case, steps 10, 11, 12 shall be skipped.\n9b.\tThe E‑UTRAN sends DL information transfer message, with the embedded 1x message indicating 1xRTT preparation success to the UE. Steps 10 and 12 are not performed in this case.\n10a/b/c.\tIf PS handover procedure is not performed then E-UTRAN sends an S1 UE Context Release Request (Cause) message to the MME. Cause indicates that the S1 UE Context Release was caused by CS fallback to 1xRTT. The S1-U bearers are released and the MME starts the preservation and suspension of non-GBR bearers and the deactivation of GBR bearers towards S-GW and P-GW(s). The MME sets the UE context to suspended status.\n11.\tUE tunes to the 1xRTT radio access network and performs 1xchannel acquisition with the 1xRTT CS access (e.g. 1xRTT BSS). A UE supporting enhanced 1xCSFB to 1xRTT for dual receiver/transmitter configuration continues to receive/transmit data on E-UTRAN.\n12.UE and Network follow the appropriate procedure for handling non-optimised PS handover procedure or optimised idle-mode PS handover as defined in TS 23.402 [27] if performed. S1 UE Context release procedure is as specified in TS 23.402 [27] for non-optimised PS handover (clause 8.2.2) or optimised idle-mode PS handover (clause 9.4). This step occurs in parallel with step 11.\nB.2.3a.3\tMobile Originating Call with concurrent optimised PS handover\nThe following figure describes the mobile originating call procedures for the enhanced CS Fallback procedure to 1xRTT with concurrent optimised PS handover, in the normal case. Clause B.2.3b describes the procedure when the procedure is rejected by the MME. This procedure is not executed for mobile originated priority 1x CS Fallback. This procedure is not performed when both the network and the UE support enhanced CS Fallback to 1xRTT for dual receiver/transmitter configuration.\nFigure B.2.3a.3-1: Enhanced CS fallback to 1xRTT MO Call with concurrent optimised PS handover\n1-5.\tSame as steps 1-5 in figure B.2.3a.2-1. The UE indicates that it supports enhanced CS fallback to 1xRTT procedure and concurrent 1xRTT and HRPD capability.\n6.\tE-UTRAN sends an Handover From E-UTRA Preparation Request message to the UE to start the enhanced 1xCS fallback procedure. It includes 3G1x Overhead Parameters and RAND value. This message also includes an indication that concurrent HRPD handover preparation is required.\n7.\tUE starts the enhanced 1xCS fallback and optimised PS handover messages (7a, 7b) in a sequential manner. Step 7a contains the 1xRTT Origination message with called party number.\n8a, 9a, 10a, and 8b, 9b, 10b.MME treats the enhanced 1xCS fallback and HRPD PS handover procedure independently (i.e. MME does not link the HRPD message and 1xCS fallback message together).\n8a, 9a, 10a is same as shown in step 8 in figure B.2.3a.2-1\n8b, 9b, 10b are messages/procedure for optimised E‑UTRAN to HRPD handover procedure as defined in TS 23.402 [27], clause 9.3.2.\n11.\tThe E-UTRAN sends Mobility from EUTRA Command to the UE with indication that this is for enhanced 1x CS Fallback operation including the 1xRTT message and the HRPD message received over the S102 and S101 tunnels.\nIf handover preparation to HRPD is successful but preparation failure message in received from the 1xRTT CS network via the S102 tunnel, the message for 1xRTT preparation failure indication is sent to the UE as part of the Mobility from EUTRA Command. If handover to HRPD is successful and the eNodeB times out waiting for preparation completion message from 1xRTT, the E-UTRAN sends a Mobility from EUTRA command with only the HPRD message included. In the case that the preparation to HRPD failed but 1xRTT is successful, E‑UTRAN may optionally include HRPD redirection info as part of the Mobility from EUTRA Command.\nIn case preparation on 1xRTT and HRPD failed with explicit failure messages received on S102 and S01 tunnels, the E-UTRAN forwards the received failure messages as DL Information transfers. In this case, steps 12 and 13 are skipped.\n12.\tUE retunes to the 1xRTT radio access network and performs 1x channel acquisition with the 1xRTT CS access (e.g. 1xRTT BSS), see TS 23.216 [20], clause 6.1.3.\n13.\tUE and network follow the optimised E-UTRAN to HRPD handover procedure. UE context release procedure follows the optimised E-UTRAN to HRPD handover procedure as defined in TS 23.402 [27], clause 9.3.2. This step occurs in parallel with step 12.\nB.2.3a.4\tMobile Terminating Call without PS handover, or with concurrent non-optimised PS handover or optimised idle-mode PS handover\nThe following figure describes the mobile terminating call procedures for the enhanced CS Fallback to 1xRTT with concurrent non-optimised PS handover or optimised idle-mode PS handover, or without PS handover, in the normal case. Clause B.2.3b describes the procedure when the procedure is rejected by the MME.\nFigure B.2.3a.4-1: Enhanced CS fallback to 1xRTT MT call without PS handover, or with concurrent non-optimised PS handover or optimised idle-mode PS handover\n1.\tUE is E‑UTRAN attached and pre-registered with 1xRTT CS as defined in clause B.2.1.1 with enhanced CS fallback to 1xRTT capability indication to E-UTRAN. The UE may also indicate that it supports concurrent 1xRTT and HRPD capability The UE may also be pre-register with HRPD access using procedures defined in TS 23.402 [27], clause 9.3.1. The UE may also indicate support of enhanced CS fallback to 1xRTT for dual receiver/transmitter configuration to E-UTRAN.\n2-7.\tSame as step 2-7 in figure B.2.3-1.\nIf priority indication in included in the S1AP UE Context Setup or modification message from the MME to the E-UTRAN, the E-UTRAN shall not initiate enhanced 1xCSFB with concurrent optimized PS handover to HRPD access.\n8-17.\tSame as steps 5 – 12 of Figure B.2.3a.2-1, with the modifications that the 1x message in step 7 of Figure B.2.3a.2-1 provided by the UE to the E-UTRAN is a 1xPage Response message and 1x messages in step 9a of Figure B.2.3.a.2-1 (step 14a of Figure B.2.3a.4-1) provided by the E-UTRAN to UE may also contain Alert With Information message to provide caller line Identification and alerting trigger with 1x channel assignment message.\nB.2.3a.5\tMobile Terminating Call with concurrent optimised PS handover\nThe following figure describes the mobile terminating call procedures for the enhanced CS Fallback to 1xRTT with concurrent optimised PS handover, in the normal case. Clause B.2.3b describes the procedure when the procedure is rejected by the MME. This procedure is not executed for mobile terminated priority 1x CS Fallback. This procedure is not performed when both the network and the UE support enhanced CS Fallback to 1xRTT for dual receiver/transmitter configuration.\nFigure B.2.3a.5-1: Enhanced CS fallback to 1xRTT MT Call with concurrent optimised PS handover\n1-8.\tSame as steps 1-8 in figure B.2.3a.4-1. The UE indicates that it supports enhanced CS fallback to 1xRTT procedures and concurrent 1xRTT and HRPD capability. The UE may also be pre-register with HRPD access using procedures defined in TS 23.402 [27], clause 9.3.1.\n9-16.\tSame as steps 6 – 13 of Figure B.2.3a.3-1, with the modifications that the 1x message in step 7 of Figure B.2.3a.2-1 provided by the UE to the E-UTRAN is a 1xPage Response message and 1x messages in step 9a of Figure B.2.3.a.2-1 (step 14 of Figure B.2.3a.5-1) provided by the E-UTRAN to UE may also contain Alert With Information message to provide caller line Identification and alerting trigger with 1x channel assignment message.\nB.2.3a.6\tInteraction between enhanced CS Fallback to 1xRTT and optimised PS handover\nFor regular optimized PS handover procedure, it is possible that the UE receives 1xRTT CS paging from EPS while optimised PS handover to HRPD is in progress. In this case, UE shall ignore the 1xRTT CS paging locally.\nB.2.3b\tMobile Originated or Mobile terminated call rejected by the MME\nThe MME may reject an Extended Service Request either for mobile originated or mobile terminated CSFB. In this case, the following procedure is executed.\nFigure B.2.3b-1: 1xCSFB MO or MT call, rejected by MME\n1.\tUE is E-UTRAN attached and pre-registered with 1xRTT CS as defined in clause B.2.1.1.\n2.\tUE makes a decision to perform a mobile originated CS call or accepts CS paging for the CS Fallback to 1xRTT (Step 6a, Clause 5.2.3).\n3.\tUE sends an Extended Service Request for mobile originating/mobile terminating 1xCS fallback to the MME.\n4.\tIf the MME decides to reject the Extended Service Request, the MME sends a Service Reject message to the UE.\nSteps 5 – 10 are executed when Service Reject is sent with a reason code which results in the UE selecting 1xRTT access, as specified in TS 24.301 [34].\n5.\tThe UE selects 1xRTT access without waiting for RRC Release.\n6.\tThe MME releases S1 by sending the S1 UE Context Release Command (Cause) message to the eNodeB. Cause value indicates that the release is triggered by CS Fallback procedure.\n7.\tIf the RRC connection is not already released, the E-UTRAN sends a RRC Connection Release message to the UE.\n8.\tThe E-UTRAN confirms the S1 Release by returning an S1 UE Context Release Complete message to the MME.\n9-10.\tDepending on the reason for rejection, MME may start Suspend Notification:\n-\tSuspend Notification: The S1-U bearers are released and the MME starts the preservation and suspension of non-GBR bearers and the deactivation of GBR bearers towards S-GW and P-GW(s).\n-\tS-GW and P-GW(s) acknowledges the bearer updates Suspend Notification and marks the UE as suspended. The P-GW discards downlink data if the UE is marked as suspended.\nB.2.4\tShort Message Service (SMS)\nB.2.4.1\tGeneral\nThe procedures for SMS in this annex apply only if the UE is 1xRTT CS Registered and the CS access domain is chosen by the UE and/or the home PLMN for delivering short messages.\nThis clause describes both the mobile originating and mobile terminating SMS over S102 which uses 1xCS procedures in EPS. SMS support is based on the S102 reference point between the MME and the 1xCS IWS, use of RRC Information Transfer message between the UE and the E-UTRAN, and use of S1 cdma2000 Tunnelling message between the E‑UTRAN and the MME.\nB.2.4.2\tMobile originating SMS\nThe following sequence flow shows the delivery of mobile originating SMS sent via the 1xMSC while in E‑UTRAN.\nFigure B.2.4.2-1: Mobile originating SMS sent via the 1xMSC while in E-UTRAN\n1.\tThe 1xRTT CS Registration procedure as described in clause B.2.1.1 has been performed earlier.\n2.\tA mobile originating short message is triggered. If the UE is in idle state, the UE performs the UE triggered Service Request procedure, which is defined in TS 23.401 [2].\n3.\tThe UE builds the SMS message to be sent as defined in 3GPP2 A.S0008 [16] and 3GPP2 A.S0009 [17].\n3a.\tThe 1xRTT SMS message is transferred from the UE to the E-UTRAN.\n3b.\tThe E-UTRAN forwards the SMS message to the MME.\n4.\tThe MME forwards the SMS message to the 1xCS IWS in an S102 Direct Transfer message.\n5.\tThe 1xCS IWS acknowledges the message.\n6.\tThe 1xCS IWS sends an ADDS Transfer message to the 1xMSC containing the SMS message as defined in 3GPP2 A.S0008 [16] and 3GPP2 A.S0009 [17].\n7.\tThe 1xMSC forwards the SMS message to the Message Centre (MC). If an acknowledgement was requested by the UE, the MC responds with an acknowledgement.\n8.\tThe 1xMSC forwards the SMS acknowledgement to the 1xCS IWS in an ADDS Page message.\n9.\tThe 1xCS IWS forwards the SMS acknowledgement to the MME in an S102 Direct Transfer message.\n10.\tThe MME forwards the SMS acknowledgement to the UE.\n11.\tThe MME sends an S102 Ack message to the 1xCS IWS. This occurs immediately after step 9 if the MSC has not requested an acknowledgement from the 1xCS IWS.\n12.\tIf the MSC requested an acknowledgement, the 1xCS IWS sends an ADDS Page Ack message to the 1xMSC.\nB.2.4.3\tMobile terminating SMS\nThe following sequence flow shows the delivery of mobile terminating SMS sent via the 1xMSC while in E‑UTRAN.\nFigure B.2.4.3-1: Mobile terminating SMS sent via the 1xMSC while in E-UTRAN\n1.\tThe UE is E-UTRAN attached and registered with 1xRTT CS as defined in clause B.2.1.1.\n2.\tThe 1xMSC receives the SMS message from the MC and sends an ADDS Page message to the 1xCS as defined in 3GPP2 A.S0008 [16] and 3GPP2 A.S0009 [17]. The ADDS Page contains the SMS message.\n3.\tThe 1xCS IWS sends the SMS message in an S102 Direct Transfer message.\n4.\tIf the UE is in idle state, the MME performs the network initiated Service Request procedure to bring the UE to active state prior to tunnelling of the SMS message toward the UE.\n5.\tThe MME forwards the SMS message to the UE.\n6.\tThe MME sends an S102 Ack message to the 1xCS IWS. This occurs immediately after step 3 if the MSC has not requested an acknowledgement from the 1xCS IWS.\n7.\tIf the MSC requested an acknowledgement, the 1xCS IWS sends an ADDS Page Ack message to the 1xMSC.\n8.\tAfter receiving the SMS message at step 5, the UE sends an SMS acknowledgement toward the MC.\n9.\tThe MME forwards the SMS acknowledgement in an S102 Direct Transfer message to the 1xCS IWS.\n10.\tThe 1xCS IWS sends an S102 Ack message to the MME.\n11.\tThe 1xCS IWS forwards the SMS acknowledgement to the 1xMSC. The 1xMSC then forwards the SMS acknowledgement to the MC.\nNOTE:\tIn addition to above MT SMS procedure (Common Channel SMS), 3GPP2 also defines Traffic Channel SMS delivering method in 3GPP2 A.S0008[16] and A.S0009 [17] that can be used in E-UTRAN-1x interworking architecture. In this method, the messages between 1xRTT IWS and 1xMSC are different from those messages specified in this clause. There is no additional functional requirement to EPS.\nB.2.5\tEmergency Calls\nWhen UE is performing CS fallback procedure to 1xRTT for the purpose of emergency call, it shall indicate to the MME that this CS fallback request is for emergency purpose. MME also indicates to the E-UTRAN via the appropriate S1-AP message that this CS fallback procedure is for emergency purpose.\nEmergency call with enhanced 1xRTT CS fallback procedure shall be executed without the concurrent PS handover procedure.\nB.3\tCS Fallback for UEs with dual Rx configuration\nB.3.1\tGeneral Considerations\nThe following principles are used for supporting CS Fallback for dual receiver UEs:\n-\tThe UE with dual Rx configuration attaches separately to each RAT (E-UTRAN, 1xRTT) and maintains separate registration and mobility procedure handling to each RAT. No coordination is required between the E‑UTRAN and 1xRTT network.\n-\tThe UE with dual Rx configuration is able to camp in 1xRTT at the same time as it is active or idle in E‑UTRAN. Camping in 1xRTT includes performing 1xRTT cell re-selection, reading broadcast channels, monitoring paging, performing location updates, etc. according to 3GPP2 specifications.\n-\tThe UE with dual Rx configuration is allowed to leave E-UTRAN in order to handle a CS call and/or perform registration signalling, and/or sending or receiving SMS in 1xRTT. The procedures for leaving E-UTRAN is described in clause B.3.2 and are only allowed if the network indicates that it supports them (this is indicated by either the presence of CSFB registration parameters or indication of support for dual Rx CSFB on E‑UTRAN broadcast channel, TS 36.331 [33]).\n-\tThe UE that reports dual Rx configuration to E‑UTRAN does not require redirection information.\nNOTE:\tFurther clarification to the UE behaviour may be needed if the procedure in clause B.3.2, i.e. time between transmission of Extended Service Request (3) and reception of RRC Connection Release (5) takes too long.\nB.3.2\tProcedures for leaving E-UTRAN\nThe UE with dual Rx configuration is allowed to leave E-UTRAN in order to handle a CS call and/or perform registration signalling, and/or perform location management signalling, and/or sending or receiving SMS in 1xRTT. When the UE needs to leave E-UTRAN it indicates this to E-UTRAN by using the Extended Service Request procedure similar to how MT/MO calls are handed in clauses B.2.2, B.2.2a and B.2.3. The procedure is the same regardless what activity is performed in the 1xRTT system (e.g. if it is a page response, MO call, re-registration). The procedure is shown in Figure B.3.2-1.\nFigure B.3.2-1: Performing 1xRTT related activity for dual receiver UEs\n1.\tUE is E‑UTRAN attached the UE may also be registered in 1xRTT CS.\n2.\tUE makes a decision that it needs to perform some 1xRTT activity (e.g. in order to respond to an incoming 1xRTT page, setup a MO call, perform location management signalling, or perform re-registration).\n3.\tUE sends an Extended Service Request for mobile originating/mobile terminating 1xCS fallback to the MME. The figure shows the case the UE is in active state in E-UTRAN but the same principles applies if the UE is in idle state, TS 23.401 [2].\n4.\tMME sends UE Context modification Request (CS Fallback Indicator) to E-UTRAN. CS Fallback Indicator indicates to the E‑UTRAN to move the UE to 1xRTT.E-UTRAN responds with UE Context Modification Response.\n5.\tThe E-UTRAN triggers RRC connection release and continues with step 6. This step may include re-direction information if the E-UTRAN indicates support for S102. E-UTRAN that indicates support for dual Rx CSFB shall not include any redirection information towards the UE that indicates dual Rx configuration but no support for enhanced CS fallback to 1xRTT.\n6.\tE-UTRAN sends an S1 UE Context Release Request (Cause) message to the MME. Cause indicates that the S1 UE Context Release was caused by CS fallback to 1xRTT.\n7.\tThe S1-U bearers are released and the MME starts the preservation and suspension of non-GBR bearers and the deactivation of GBR bearers towards S-GW and P-GW(s). by sending Suspend Notification to S-GW and P-GW The MME sets the UE context to suspended status.\n8.\tThe S-GW and P-GW(s) acknowledges the bearer updates by responding with Suspend Acknowledge and marks the UE as suspended in S-GW and P-GW. When a downlink data arrives at the P-GW, the P-GW should not send downlink data if the UE is marked as suspended.\n9.\tS1 UE Context in the E-UTRAN is released as specified in TS 23.401 [2].\nB.3.3\tProcedures for returning to E-UTRAN\nThe procedure for returning to E-UTRAN is the same as specified in clause 6.5.\nAnnex C (normative):SMS in MME\nC.1\tGeneral\nSMS in MME is an architecture option primarily intended for networks that do not deploy GERAN or UTRAN. SMS in MME delivers SMS services over EPS NAS signalling for UE's requiring SMS services. SMS in MME architecture option enables support of SMS in the EPS via E-UTRAN without requiring deployment of 3GPP MSCs.\nFor SMS in MME the SMS service control is performed by the MME. The MME receives SMS subscriber data and the MME verifies whether the subscriber is permitted to obtain SMS services.\nThe SMS subscriber data received and used by the MME may be PS subscriber data (the MME directly obtains from HSS) or CS subscriber data (the MME obtains via an interworking function as described in clause C.5).\nNOTE:\tThe use of SMS in MME by an operator that also deploys CS service on GERAN or UTRAN may lead to increased signalling traffic to the HSS.\nC.2\tArchitecture\nAs outlined in the architecture figure below SMS in MME requires support of SMS functionality in the MME and the MME also needs to receive SMS subscription information from the HSS. The SMS subscription information may be received through the S6a interface.\nFigure C.2-1: SMS in MME Architecture\nFigure C.2-2: SMS in MME architecture using IWF\nThere is no impact on the UE and E-UTRAN. The SMS entities (including SMS router, etc.) functionality to support SMS in MME is the same as defined for reference point 2 and 3 in TS 23.040 [14] except the SGd and S6c interfaces use Diameter protocols as specified in TS 29.338 [43]. The interaction between SMS in MME and SMS over IP is described in TS 23.204 [15].\nNOTE 1:\tThe HSS may support both a Diameter S6c and a MAP C interface to SMS entities that have not evolved to S6c, or the SMS entities may support both interfaces to obtain routing information from HSS's that have not evolved to S6c.\nNOTE 2:\tAccording to TS 23.040 [14], the SMS-Router is optional and only required for MT SMS.\nC.3\tReference Points\nC.3.1\tGeneral\nThe following reference points specifically enable support of SMS in MME.\nC.3.2\tS6a\nIn order to support \"SMS in MME\" the S6a shall allow the MME to request SMS subscription information and to register as a serving node for SMS. If the HSS supports this and has SMS subscription information available, it sends SMS subscription data to the MME. The SMS subscription data include for example the barring status of MO-SMS and MT-SMS and the MSISDN. If the HSS determines that the MME shall be deregistered for SMS, it shall indicate to the MME that it is not registered for SMS.\nC.3.3\tS6c\nIn order to support \"SMS in MME\" the Diameter based S6c shall allow the SMS central functions to request routing information from the HSS.\nC.3.4\tSGd\nIn order to support \"SMS in MME\" the Diameter based SGd shall provide the Short Message Relay Layer (SM-RL) between MME serving the UE and SMS central functions.\nC.4\tNetwork Entities\nC.4.1\tGeneral\nThe following network entities specifically enable support of SMS in MME\nC.4.2\tMME\nThe MME needs to support the following features:\n-\tUE-MME NAS procedures for SMS over SGs.\n-\tS6a functionality as described in clause C.3.2.\n-\tSMS procedures between UE and MME including support for the Short Message Control (SMC) and Short Message Relay (SM-RL) functions defined in TS 24.011 [28].\n-\tReporting UE's availability for receiving MT SMS to the HSS.\n-\tSMS functions including charging and Lawful Interception (LI).\n-\tSupport combined EPS/IMSI procedures for \"SMS-only\" and in these:\n-\tprovide a non-broadcasted LAI (not associated with any VLR); and\n-\tif needed provide a reserved TMSI that cannot cause any ambiguities with other TMSIs (e.g. when the UE changes to an area where it needs to derive SMS services from a GERAN/UTRAN MSC); and\n-\tindicate in the Attach/TAU Accept message that the IMSI attach is for \"SMS-only\"; and\n-\tnotify the HSS it is capable of SMS transfer without the need of establishing an SGs association with an MSC; and\n-\tobtain SMS-related subscription information.\n-\tSupport the registration procedures for SMS in MME described in clause C.8.\n-\tSupport for Service Gap Control for MO SMS as specified in TS 23.401 [2], clause 4.3.17.9.\nC.4.3\tHSS\nWhen an MME registers via the S6a including a registration for SMS Request, the HSS registers the MME as an MSC for MT SMS (i.e. in response to Send Routing Information (SRI) for SM the MME identity is passed back to the SMS‑GMSC/SMS router) when the HSS supports and decides to use SMS in MME. This registration as an MSC for MT SMS causes the HSS to cancel any old registered MSC. See clause C.8 for the detailed registration procedures. If the HSS receives a SRI for other CS Services than SMS it shall treat the UE as if it was detached from the CS domain. If the UE subsequently registers with an MSC for CS services, the HSS needs to replace the MME with the new MSC as the destination for SMS (but this is not a reason to cancel the MMEs registration for EPS Services).\nNOTE 1:\tThat an HSS that supports SMS in MME registers the MME as an MSC for MT SMS does not affect how the information is stored in the HSS, however the HSS reuses the MNRF flag intended for the controlling SM delivery via the MSC, for controlling the SM delivery via MME. It only affects what serving node identities are returned in response to SRI for SM. In such cases the MME identity is passed back to the SMS-GMSC/SMS router where usually the MSC identity is sent.\nNOTE 2:\tFor the PS and SMS only service to work also for outbound roamers, the 3GPP LTE-only operator may need to configure CS subscription data for SMS services in its HSS as a visited PLMN may deploy SMS over SGs. It may also use an IWF for MAP and Diameter translation. The 3GPP 2G/3G/LTE operator may need to upgrade its HSS to ensure that its outbound roamers get SMS services as a VPLMN may deploy only SMS in MME.\nAn HSS allows an operator to configure a subscription, which is limited to only PS domain services and to SMS service via the CS and the PS domain. This limitation is indicated in the PS subscription data as \"PS and SMS only\".\nNOTE 3:\tThe limitation of a subscription to only PS and SMS services can for example be based on an operator agreement with an MTC service provider, that only PS resources shall be used whenever possible.\nWhen an HSS supports \"SMS in MME\", i.e. provides all HSS functionality described for \"SMS in MME\", and the operator configured the HSS to apply that functionality, the HSS indicates \"SMS in MME Support\" in the data provided to an MME.\nNOTE 4:\tThis separate handling of SMS subscriber data in the MME is also for aligning with the deployment option of an IWF for S6a that combines PS subscriber data with SMS subscriber data from CS subscriber data, where the data part that stems from CS subscriber data may be cancelled in MME independently from PS subscriber data. When the PS subscriber data are cancelled then any UE related subscriber data are cancelled in the MME.\nIf the HSS determines that an MME shall be deregistered for SMS (e.g. because of a removal of SMS subscription, CS location update, etc), the HSS shall indicate to the MME that it is not registered for SMS.\nC.5\tRoaming considerations\nThe SMS in MME architecture is an optional architecture enhancement for operators that wish to avoid to the use of MSC and SGs and do not provide Fallback to 3GPP CS services over GERAN or UTRAN.\nTo support inbound roamers from networks that do not support the provision of SMS subscription information over S6a there are different options to provide interworking, e.g.:\n-\tSMS over SGs.\n-\tUse of an interworking function to convert between the S6a with SMS subscription data and S6a without SMS subscription data and D for SMS subscription. When the MME sends Ready for SM message to HSS for UE reachability notification, the interworking function also needs to convert the Ready for SM message transferred via the S6a interface to Ready for SM message transferred via the D interface.\nOperators that do not deploy the SMS in MME architecture option are not required to support the S6a enhancements in the HSS or the MME.\nC.6\tUnsuccessful Mobile-Terminated SMS Transfer\nThe MME or the HSS may not be able to deliver the SM to the UE. This can for example happen when the UE is not attached to EPS, when the UE's SMS memory capacity is exceeded, or when the Mobile-terminated SMS is barred.\nWhen the MME cannot deliver the SM to the UE, the MME shall return a failure report to the SMS GMSC/SMS router. The SMS-GMSC/SMS router/HSS procedures for handling the failure report are specified in TS 23.040 [14]. Additionally, if the SM failed due to the UE not being reachable, the MME shall set the Mobile-Not-Reachable-Flag-in-MME-for-SMS (MNRF-MME) indication in the MME.\nIf the UE is using extended idle mode DRX with a DRX cycle value or if the UE is in PSM (as defined in TS 23.682 [48]) that can cause mobile terminating SMS retransmissions, the MME may return a failure report to the SMS GMSC/SMS router while still paging the UE. The MME shall set the Mobile-Not-Reachable-Flag-in-MME-for-SMS (MNRF-MME) indication in the MME.\nIf the UE subsequently becomes reachable and MNRF-MME indication is set, the MME shall send a Ready for SM (IMSI, UE-Present) message to the HSS and the MME shall clear the corresponding MNRF-MME indication for that UE.\nNOTE:\tIn the case that MME receives an indication from S‑GW that the UE has handover to non-3GPP coverage, it will not trigger this activity notification.\nIf the UE subsequently notifies the MME that SMS memory is available, the MME shall send a Ready for SM (IMSI, UE-Memory-Available) message to the HSS.\nReception of a Ready for SM message or an Update Location Request message by the HSS when MNRF is set, shall trigger the SMS alert procedure as defined in TS 23.040 [14].\nC.7\tInformation storage\nC.7.1\tHSS\nThe following table specifies the HSS data defined per UE to support SMS in MME.\nTable C.7.1-1: HSS data\nField\nDescription\nSMS Subscription Parameters\nSMS subscription parameters, e.g. SMS teleservice, SMS barring list.\nNetwork Access Mode (NAM)\nIndicates whether the subscription includes subscriber data allowing for accessing PS and or CS domain.\nNOTE 2\nPS and SMS only\nIndicates a subscription which is limited to PS domain services and to SMS service via the CS and the PS domain.\nNOTE 2\nMME Registered for SMS\nIndicates that MME has been registered for SMS in the HSS\nNOTE 1:\tWhen the UE is not reachable in the MME, the HSS sets the MNRF in the Message Waiting Data (MWD) since the MME is registered as an MSC.\nNOTE 2:\tIf \"PS and SMS only\" is set for this subscriber, NAM is set to \"CS+PS\".\nWhen the HSS functionality for \"SMS in the MME\" is enabled, the HSS will include an \"SMS in MME\" feature indication along with the UE subscription information to the MME.\nC.7.2\tMME\nThe following table specifies the MME data defined per UE to support SMS in MME.\nTable C.7.2-1: MME Context for SMS\nField\nDescription\nSMS Subscription Data\nSMS subscription parameters, e.g. SMS teleservice, SMS barring list.\nMME Registered for SMS\nIndicates that MME has been registered for SMS in the HSS\nMNRF-MME\nIndicates whether activity from the UE shall be reported to the HSS.\nNetwork Access Mode (NAM)\nIndicates whether the subscription includes subscriber data allowing for access to PS and or CS domain.\nNOTE 1\nPS and SMS only\nIndicates a subscription which is limited to PS domain services and to SMS service via the CS and the PS domain.\nNOTE 1\nSMS in MME Support\nCapability of the HSS to support the SMS in MME feature\nNOTE 1:\tIf \"PS and SMS only\" is set for this subscriber, NAM is set to \"CS+PS\".\nC.8\tRegistration of MME for SMS\nC.8.1\tRequest for registration\nAn MME supporting SMS in MME that needs to perform a registration with HSS shall follow the following procedure to become registered by the HSS also for SMS.\nThe following sequence shows the request for registration with the HSS for SMS in MME.\nFigure C.8.1-1: MME registration for SMS\n1.\tThe UE initiates combined attach or combined TA/LA Update to an MME. A UE that only supports NB-IoT (see TS 23.401 [2]) may issue an EPS attach or TA Update instead of a combined attach or combined TA/LA Update.\n2.\tThe MME sends a Location Update Request (SMS in MME feature flag, MME address for MT-SMS routing, RegistrationForSMSRequest, \"SMS-only\" Indication) message to HSS. SMS in MME feature flag indicates that the MME is capable of SMS transfer without the need of establishing an SGs association with an MSC. The \"SMS-only\" Indication is included if it has been included in the request from the UE. The MME includes one of the following RegistrationForSMSRequest values based on the criteria shown in Table C.8.1-1.\nTable C.8.1-1: Registration For SMS Request values\nValue\nDescription\nSMS in MME Required\n-\tMME does not support SGs; or\n-\tThe MME can be configured to use this value when the UE indicates \"SMS only\" or when known that the subscription is \"PS and SMS only\".\nNOTE 1\nSMS in MME Not Preferred\n-\tThe MME can be configured to use this value when the UE indicates \"SMS only\" or when known that the subscription is \"PS and SMS only\"\n-\tThe MME can be configured to use this value when the UE does not indicate \"SMS only\" (i.e. requests CSFB) and the MME has no subscriber data yet (when MME is configured to use SGs for \"SMS and PS only\" subscription).\nNOTE 2\nNo Preference for SMS in MME\n-\tThe MME has no preference configured to use SMS in MME or SGs, but both options are available from MME perspective.\nNOTE 2\nNOTE 1:\tIf this is set the HSS cannot determine whether the SGs is available.\nNOTE 2:\tIf this value is set it means that the MME supports SGs. UE might or might not indicate \"SMS-only\".\n3.\tIf the HSS supports SMS in MME and the subscription includes SMS:\na)\tif one or more of the following is true:\n-\tNetwork Access Mode is PS only; or\n-\tthe MME indicates \"SMS in MME Required\";\nthen the HSS shall register the MME for SMS;\nb)\tif the MME indicates \"No Preference for SMS in MME\" and Network Access Mode is not equal to PS only but one or more of the following are true:\n-\tthe UE indicated \"SMS-only\";\n-\tthe subscription is limited to PS domain services and SMS service via the CS and the PS domain (\"PS and SMS only\");\nthen the HSS should register the MME for SMS;\nNOTE 3:\tThe HSS can decide not to register the MME for SMS since it knows that the MME supports SGs but the normal behaviour would be to register for SMS and avoid an SGs association.\nc)\tif the MME indicates \"SMS in MME Not Preferred\" and Network Access Mode is not equal to PS only then the HSS should not register the MME for SMS;\nNOTE 4:\tThe HSS can decide to register the MME for SMS based on the \"PS and SMS only\" setting and also on other factors including the UE indication for \"SMS-Only\", it is however assumed the normal behaviour would be not to register for SMS.\nd)\totherwise the HSS shall not register the MME for SMS.\nIf HSS registered the MME for SMS, the HSS stores the MME address for MT SMS.\n4.\tIf the HSS accepts to register the MME identity as an MSC identity for terminating SMS services then the HSS cancels the MSC/VLR registration from the HSS.\n5.\tThe HSS sends a Location Update Answer (indication whether the MME has been registered for SMS, subscription data including the Network Access Mode and \"PS and SMS only\" indications, SMS subscription data, SMS in MME feature flag) message to MME.\nIf the HSS does not register the MME for SMS, it shall indicate that the MME has not been registered for SMS and not include any SMS subscription data.\nSMS in MME feature flag indicates that the HSS is capable of supporting the SMS in MME feature.\nThe MME stores the returned data and checks the result of registering the MME for SMS.\nIf the registration for SMS was not accepted, the MME does following:\na.\tFor a PS-only subscription (i.e. the Network Access Mode in the subscription equals \"PS-only\"), the MME shall not establish any SGs association (no SMS services are provided to the UE).\nb.\tFor a \"PS and SMS only\" subscription where SMS can be provided over CS (i.e. the Network Access Mode equals \"PS+CS\" and the subscription parameter \"PS and SMS only\" is set), the MME tries to establish SGs for SMS.\nc.\tFor a PS and CS subscription where also other CS services are allowed (i.e. Network Access Mode equals \"PS+CS\" and the subscription parameter \"PS and SMS only\" is not set), the MME tries to establish SGs for SMS and other CS services.\nC.8.2\tRemoval of registration of MME for SMS\nC.8.2.0\tGeneral\nThe removal of the registration of MME for SMS is used by:\n-\tThe HSS to inform the MME that the registration of MME for SMS is cancelled; or by\n-\tThe MME to inform the HSS that it requests to remove its registration for SMS.\nC.8.2.1\tHSS-initiated removal of registration of MME for SMS\nWhen the HSS needs to indicate to the MME that it is no longer registered for SMS, (e.g. because of a removal of SMS subscription, CS location update, etc), the following procedure is applied.\nFigure C.8.2-1: Cancellation of MME registration for SMS in MME\n1.\tThere is an event that shall trigger the cancellation of the MME being registered for SMS. This may for example be the removal of the SMS subscription for the UE, a CS location update, etc.\n2.\tThe HSS sends an Insert Subscriber Data Request (Remove SMS registration) message to the MME to inform the MME that it is no more registered for SMS in MME.\n3.\tThe MME sets its \"MME Registered for SMS\" parameter as not registered for SMS and the \"SMS subscription data\" is considered by the MME as invalid. It acknowledges with an Insert Subscriber Data Answer message to the HSS.\nNOTE:\tA normal Cancel Location of MME which results in the MME no longer being registered for PS services for that UE will also render the MME not registered for SMS.\nC.8.2.2\tMME-initiated removal of registration of MME for SMS\nWhen the MME needs to indicate to the HSS that it is no longer registered for SMS in HSS, (e.g. because the UE initiated a EPS attach only, TAU), the following procedure is applied.\nFigure C.8.2-2: Removal of MME registration for SMS in HSS\n1.\tThere is an event that triggers the cancellation of the MME being registered for SMS. This may for example be an UE initiated EPS attach only or a TAU.\n2.\tThe MME sends a message to the HSS to inform the HSS to remove its registration for SMS in HSS.\n3.\tThe HSS cancels the SMS registration for the UE in the MME.
