The PCF in the serving network may (e.g. due to varying conditions such as 5G-RG's location, time and date) further adjust Service Area Restrictions of a 5G-RG, either by expanding an allowed area or by reducing a non-allowed area. The UDM and the PCF may update the Service Area Restrictions of a 5G-RG or a FN-CRG at any time.\nDuring registration, if the Service Area Restrictions of the 5G-RG or FN-CRG is not present in the AMF, the AMF fetches from the UDM the Service Area Restrictions of the 5G-RG or FN-CRG that may be further adjusted by the PCF.

There shall be one and only one Default W-UP resource per PDU session. The 5G-RG shall send all QoS Flows to this W-UP resource for which there is no mapping information to a specific W-UP resource.\nHandling of UL traffic by the 5G-RG:\n-\tWhen the 5G-RG transmits an UL PDU, the 5G-RG shall determine the QFI associated with the UL PDU (by using the QoS rules of the PDU Session), it shall encapsulate the UL PDU inside an access layer dependent W-UP packet and shall forward the W-UP packet to W-AGF via the W-UP resource associated with this QFI.\nHandling of DL traffic by W-AGF:\n-\tWhen the W-AGF receives a DL PDU via N3, it identifies of the PDU Session and optionally the QFI in order to determine the W-UP resource to use for sending the DL PDU to the 5G-RG.

The mapping of 5QI to W-5GBAN QoS parameters is specified by the BBF for W-5GBAN in [9].

When the UDM notifies the AMF of the updated RG-LWAC via Nudm_SDM_Notification service, the AMF may update the RG-LWAC to the W-AGF via NGAP UE Context Modification procedure.\nGiven that the 5GC does not act on these parameters, their structure is out of scope in 3GPP specifications and they are handled as a transparent data container.

The SMF determines the size of the prefix for a PDU Session to a specific DNN and S-NSSAI based on subscription data and local configuration. The individual /128 address(es) allocated to the RG as part of DHCP IA_NA procedure are then selected from the prefix allocated to the PDU Session.

      "content": "An RG connecting via W-5GAN or NG-RAN access towards 5GC can provide connectivity for a UE behind the RG to access an N3IWF or TNGF. It is assumed that the UE is 5GC capable, i.e. supports untrusted non-3GPP access and/or trusted non-3GPP access. This allows the RG, W-5GAN and the RG's connectivity via 5GC to together act as untrusted/trusted N3GPP access to support UEs behind the RG.\nWhen FN-RG/5G-RG is serving a UE, the control and user plane packets of the UE is transported using a FN-RG/5G-RG IP PDU session and then from PSA UPF of that PDU session to an N3IWF or TNGF. A single FN-RG/5G-RG IP PDU session can be used to serve multiple UEs.\nFigure 4.10-1 shows the non-roaming architecture for a UE, behind a 5G-RG, accessing the 5GC via TNGF where the combination of 5G-RG, W-5GAN and UPF serving the 5G-RG is acting as a trusted Non-3GPP access network.\nFigure 4.10-2a shows the non-roaming architecture for a UE, behind a FN-RG, accessing the 5GC via N3IWF.\nFigure 4.10-2b shows the non-roaming architecture for a UE, behind a 5G-RG, accessing the 5GC via N3IWF.\nAnnex A shows the non-roaming architecture for a UE, behind a FN-RG/5G-RG, accessing the 5GC via N3IWF where the combination of FN-RG/5G-RG, W-5GAN and UPF serving the 5G-RG is acting as an untrusted Non-3GPP access network.\nNOTE 1:\tFN-RG and W-5GAN acting as trusted Non-3GPP access is not considered in this specification as it is assumed that FN-RG is not 5G capable and therefore it does not support Ta reference point.\nFigure 4.10-1: Non-roaming architecture for UE behind 5G-RG using trusted N3GPP access\nThe 5G-RG can be connected to 5GC via W-5GAN, NG-RAN or via both accesses. The UE can be connected to 5GC via trusted non-3GPP access with 5G-RG acting as TNAP, NG-RAN or via both accesses.\nFigure 4.10-2a: Architecture for UE behind FN-RG using untrusted N3GPP access\nFigure 4.10-2b: Architecture for UE behind 5G-RG using untrusted N3GPP access\nThe FN-RG can only be connected to 5GC via W-5GAN. The 5G-RG can be connected to 5GC via W-5GAN, NG-RAN or via both accesses. The UE can be connected to 5GC via untrusted non-3GPP access with FN-RG/5G-RG acting as WLAN access point, NG-RAN or via both accesses.\nThe TNGF and Ta reference point are defined in TS 23.501 [2]. In addition to the requirements described in TS 23.501 [2], the Ta reference point should be able to carry the TNAP ID to the TNGF.\nNOTE 2:\tThe reference architecture in figure 4.10-1/4.10-2a/4.10-2b only shows the architecture and the network functions directly connected to W-5GAN or TNGF/N3IWF, and other parts of the architecture are the same as defined in clause 4.2 of TS 23.501 [2].\nNOTE 3:\tThe reference architecture in figure 4.10-1 supports service based interfaces for AMF, SMF and other NFs not represented in the figure.\nNOTE 4:\tThe two N2 instances in Figure 4.10-1/4.10-2b apply to a single AMF for a 5G-RG which is simultaneously connected to the same 5G Core Network over 3GPP access and W-5GAN.\nNOTE 5:\tFor trusted non-3GPP access, UE connects to the overlay 5G network using the trusted non-3GPP access approach. In addition to being connected to the underlay 5G network, the 5G-RG also acts as TNAP with respect to the TNGF in the overlay network i.e. it has an established Ta reference point with the TNGF.\nNOTE 6:\tSupport for QoS differentiation can be achieved in a similar way as it is handled when a UE connects to a PLMN via SNPN (as defined in clauses 5.30.2.7 and D.7 of TS 23.501 [2]). Also differentiated charging, both in the RG's PLMN and in the UE's PLMN, can be achieved based on existing mechanisms. This is further described in Annex B.\nSupport of NSWO for 3GPP UE behind an RG is specified in clause 4.10d.\nA 5G-RG acting as a TNAP shall provide its TNAP ID. to the TNGF and the TNGF provides this TNAP ID as part of ULI (User Location Information) sent to the 5GC; this information is propagated to the PCF that may use it to determine PCC rules depending on whether an UE is using a 5G-RG as a host or as a guest.\nNOTE 7:\tQoS and charging differentiation based on user location (e.g. home or guest users) can be applied when the user is connected via a TNGF reached over a 5G-RG. The PCF may use the TNAP ID, which is available to it as a part of ULI. For example, if the TNAP ID is included in the UE's policy control subscription information the UE is considered a home user. Alternatively, the PCF may use TNAP ID provided by an AF using the Service Specific parameter provisioning as defined in clause 9.8.\n4.10a\tNon-5G capable device behind 5G-CRG and FN-CRG\nFor isolated 5G networks (i.e. roaming is not considered) with wireline access, non-5G capable (N5GC) devices connecting via W-5GAN can be authenticated by the 5GC using EAP based authentication method(s) as defined in TS 33.501 [11]. The following call flow describes the overall registration procedure of such a device.\nRoaming is not supported for N5GC devices.\nThe usage of N5GC device correspond to a subscription record in UDM/UDR that is separate from that of the CRG.\nFigure 4.10a-1: 5GC registration of Non-5GC device\n1.\tThe W-AGF registers the FN-CRG to 5GC as specified in clause 7.2.1.3 or the 5G-CRG registers to 5GC as specified in clause 7.2.1.1.\n2.\tThe CRG is configured as L2 bridge mode and forwards any L2 frame to W-AGF. 802.1x authentication may be triggered. This can be done either by N5GC device sending a EAPOL-start frame to W-AGF or W-AGF receives a frame from an unknown MAC address.\nHow the CRG is configured to work in L2 bridge mode and how the W-AGF is triggered to apply procedures for N5GC devices is defined in CableLabs WR-TR-5WWC-ARCH [27].\nThe N5GC device send an EAP-Resp/Indentity including its Network Access Identifier (NAI) in the form of username@realm.\n3.\tW-AGF, on behalf of the N5GC device, sends a NAS Registration Request message to AMF with a device capability indicator that the device is non-5G capable. For this purpose, the W-AGF creates a NAS Registration Request message containing a SUCI. The W-AGF constructs the SUCI from the NAI received within EAP-Identity from the N5GC device as defined in TS 33.501 [11].\nOver N2 there is a separate NGAP connection per N5GC device served by the W-AGF.\nWhen it provides (over N2) ULI to be associated with a N5GC device, the W-AGF builds the N5GC's ULI using the GCI (see clause 4.7.9) of the CRG connecting the N5GC device.\nNOTE:\tHow the W-AGF determines the CRG connecting a N5GC device is specified in CableLabs WR-TR-5WWC-ARCH [27].\n4.\tAMF selects a suitable AUSF as specified in TS 23.501 [2] clause 6.3.4.\n5.\tEAP based authentication defined in TS 33.501 [11] is performed between the AUSF and N5GC device.\nOnce the N5GC device has been authenticated, the AUSF provides relevant security related information to the AMF. AUSF shall return the SUPI (this SUPI corresponds to a NAI that contains the username of the N5GC device and a realm as defined in TS 33.501 [11]) to AMF only after the authentication is successful.\nNOTE:\tEach N5GC device is registered to 5GC with its own unique SUPI.\n6.\tThe AMF performs other registration procedures as required (see TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.2.2.2.2).\nWhen providing a PEI for a N5GC device, the W-AGF shall provide a PEI containing the MAC address of the N5GC device. The W-AGF may, based on operator policy, encode the MAC address of the N5GC device using the IEEE Extended Unique Identifier EUI-64 format (see IEE Publication [41]).\n7.\tThe AMF sends Registration Accept message to W-AGF.\nOnce the registration procedure is completed, the W-AGF requests the establishment of a PDU Session on behalf of the N5GC device. Only one PDU session per N5GC device is supported. The procedure is the same as the PDU Session establishment procedure specified in clause 7.3.4 with the difference as below:\nAfter successful registration, PDU Session establishment/modification/release procedure specified in clause 7.3.4, 7.3.6, and 7.3.7 apply with the difference as below:\n-\tFN-RG is replaced by N5GC device.\nThe W-AGF shall request the release of the NGAP connection for each N5GC device served by a CRG whose NGAP connection has been released.\n5G-CRG behaves as FN-CRG (i.e. L2 bridge mode) when handling N5GC devices.\n4.10b\tDifferentiated services for NAUN3 devices behind 5G-RG\nNAUN3 devices cannot be authenticated by 5GC but may e.g. be locally authenticated by the 5G-RG using e.g. pre-shared secret. Differentiated services (QoS, network slicing) may be provided for NAUN3 devices as defined in this clause.\n\"Connectivity Group IDs\" may be defined on the 5G-RG where each Connectivity Group ID corresponds to a separate physical or virtual port on the 5G-RG. These ports could, for example, refer to separate physical ethernet ports and/or to separate WLAN SSIDs and/or to a separate VLAN. The devices that connect to a certain logical port are considered part of the same Connectivity Group ID. How this configuration on the 5G-RG is done is out of scope of this specification.\nEach Connectivity Group ID is then mapped to a separate PDU Session that is established by the 5G-RG based on the procedures defined in clause 7. The overall architecture is illustrated in Figure-4.10b-1.\nFigure 4.10b-1: Example scenario for NAUN3 devices behind 5G-RG based on connectivity groups\nThe 5G-RG is configured with the (virtual) port information (e.g. VLANs and SSIDs) based on TR-69 [18], TR-360 and TR-181 [46]. URSP rules can be provided to the 5G-RG to indicate how to map Connectivity Group ID to the parameters of the PDU Session used to carry the traffic of corresponding devices e.g. DNN, S-NSSAI, etc.\nNOTE:\tIn addition, the mapping between a \"virtual port\" and DNN/S-NSSAI can be configured via TR-69 [18]/TR-181 [46].\nWhether and how the NAUN3 devices are configured to use a specific SSID or connect to a certain Ethernet port on the 5G-RG is out of scope of this specification.\nDifferentiation of charging and QoS may be provided via PCC rules (for different service flows) related with dedicated PDU Sessions for NAUN3 devices. Isolation of devices using a specific Connectivity Group ID into a specific network slice, i.e. with separate S-NSSAI may also be provided.\n4.10c\tAuthenticable Non-3GPP devices behind 5G-RG\nThis clause defines the support of AUN3 devices, i.e. Authenticable Non-3GPP devices (AUN3) as defined in clause 3.1, behind a 5G-RG. This clause applies only to 5G-RG connected via wireline access.\nFigure 4.10c-1 shows the architecture for support of AUN3 device.\nFigure 4.10c-1: AUN3 device behind 5G-RG\nDifferentiated services for AUN3 devices behind 5G-RG are provided as specified below:\n-\tEach AUN3 device has its own UDM/UDR subscription data including its own SUPI and policy control subscription data.\n-\tThe interface between 5G-RG and AUN3 devices is out of scope of 3GPP.\n-\tIn order to serve the AUN3 device in 5GC, a 5G-RG issues a NAS register and handles RM and CM related signalling on behalf of an AUN3 device that it is requesting to be served and relays EAP signalling between the AUN3 device and the 5GC.\n-\tA 5G-RG serving an AUN3 device establishes a single PDU Session on behalf on this AUN3 device.\n-\tThe AMF and the 5G-RG maintain a separate NAS connection per AUN3 device. This includes maintaining a GUTI and NAS (RM, CM, etc.) context per AUN3 device. As described in TS 33.501 [11], NAS security (encryption, integrity protection) is not used for AUN3 device.\n-\tA 5G-RG shall be connected to the 5GC (be in RM-REGISTERED and CM-CONNECTED mode) over Wireline access to serve an AUN3 device: the 5G-RG shall not issue a NAS register or service request on behalf of an AUN3 device if it is itself not registered and connected to the 5GC.\n-\tThe operator configures the access restrictions in the subscription data of all AUN3-capable subscriptions to not allow them to connect to 5GS via 3GPP access.\n-\tThe 5G-RG is configured with URSP for each AUN3 devices it serves. The UE PCF selected by the AMF at the registration of an AUN3 device sends this URSP to 5G-RG via the AMF and the NAS connection of the AUN3 device.\n-\tThe AUN3 devices and the 5G-RG belong to the same PLMN.\n-\tA 5G-RG uses default values, which are the same for all AUN3 devices it serves, to populate the parameters in the Registration Request message built on behalf of an AUN3 device. For example, the 5G-RG issues the Registration Request with no S-NSSAI and the AMF selects the default S-NSSAI in the subscription of the AUN3 device.\n-\tThere shall be a separate N2 connection per AUN3 device that is in state CM-CONNECTED.\n-\tThe W-AGF shall determine that a W-CP connection is for an AUN3 device and apply corresponding policies. The W-AGF indicates to the AMF when an N2 connection relates to an AUN3 device.\nNOTE 1:\tHow the W-AGF determines the W-CP connection is for an AUN3 device is defined by BBF and CableLabs.\n-\tThe same W-AGF shall serve a 5G-RG and all AUN3 devices connected via this 5G-RG.\n-\tThe W-CP and W-UP protocols shall be able to manage multiple connections for different subscribers (the 5G-RG itself and the different AUN3 devices) between the same pair of 5G-RG and W-AGF. In particular, W-CP needs to be able to differentiate NAS messages related to a 5G-RG and to each different AUN3 device served by this 5G-RG and W-UP needs to distinguish between user plane packets for a 5G-RG and user plane packets for each different AUN3 device served by this 5G-RG.\n-\tWhen the registration of an AUN3 device has successfully completed, the 5G-RG establishes a PDU Session on behalf of the AUN3 device. This PDU Session is handled by 5GC as part of the AUN3 subscription and is associated with the SUPI of AUN3 device. An AUN3 device can at a given time only use a single PDU Session. The parameters to establish this PDU session are based on the URSP (if any) for the AUN3 device.\n-\tDifferent QoS parameters may apply to PDU sessions of different AUN3 devices.\n-\tRoaming is not applicable to subscriptions for AUN3 devices.\n-\tThe RG Level Wireline Access Characteristics sent to the W-AGF for a 5G-RG may contain a maximum bit rate for the aggregated traffic of the 5G-RG and of the AUN3 devices served by this 5G-RG. The W-AGF uses this information to limit the maximum bit rate of the aggregated user plane traffic of the 5G-RG and of the AUN3 devices served by this 5G-RG.\nNOTE 2:\tThe coding of the maximum bit rate in RG Level Wireline Access Characteristics is defined by BBF and CableLabs specifications.\n-\tIf a W-AGF detects that a 5G-RG is unreachable, then the W-AGF triggers the N2 UE context release. The W-AGF identifies if there exists any AUN3 device connected to the 5G-RG through the W-AGF. For each identified AUN3 device, the W-AGF invokes step 5 and 6 of Figure 7.2.8.3-1 which releases the PDU sessions of these AUN3 devices.\n-\tThe Registration Management of AUN3 devices follows clause 5.5.1 of TS 23.501 [2] for Registration Management related with non-3GPP access networks.\n4.10d\tSupport of NSWO for 3GPP UE behind a RG\nNSWO as defined in clauses 4.2.15 and 5.42 of TS 23.501 [2] may be supported for UE(s) connected via a 5G-RG, and/or for UE(s) connected via a FN-RG.\nWhen this feature is supported, the RG and the W-5GAN need to support the WLAN Access functionality defined in clauses 4.2.15 and 5.42 of TS 23.501 [2]. The WLAN Access functionality includes the support of the SWa' interface to NSWOF. The SWa' support in Wireline access network has no impact on 3GPP specifications.\nNOTE:\tW-5GAN specifications and deployments can ensure that a AAA proxy is used to support SWa' interface with NSWOF(s) on behalf of RG(s). This can be used for FN-RG that do not support SWa'. This AAA proxy does not need to support the functionalities of a 3GPP AAA proxy defined in TS 23.402 [45].\nWhen NSWO applies, the user plane traffic of the UE is not traversing the UE's 5GC.\nThe specification of functionalities to support NSWO in the wireline access network is out of 3GPP scope including specifications on how the offloaded traffic is carried in W-5GAN and bypass the 5GC of the UE.\nThe UE can also connect to 5GC using 5GS credentials as defined in clause 5.42 of TS 23.501 [2].\nA 5G RG shall not issue authentication request over SWa' for the UE if it is itself not registered to 5GC.",

      "content": "The 5G-RG registration management procedures are followed for both W-5GBAN and W-5GCAN.\nClause 7.2.1.1 specifies how a 5G-RG can register to 5GC via aW-5GAN. It is based on the Registration procedure specified in TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.2.2.2.2. The NAS protocol is transported between 5G-RG and W-AGF as documented in BBF TR‑456 issue 2 [43] and CableLabs WR‑TR‑5WWC‑ARCH [27]. If the 5G-RG needs to be authenticated, mutual authentication is executed between the 5G-RG and AUSF. The details of the authentication procedure are specified in TS 33.501 [11]. In Registration and subsequent Registration procedures via W-5GAN access, the NAS messages are always exchanged between the 5G-RG and the AMF. When possible, the 5G-RG can be authenticated by reusing the existing UE security context in AMF for the 5G-RG.\nFigure 7.2.1.1-1 only shows authentication flow using EAP-AKA' (specifically in step 6c, step 7a and step 7b) but other methods are possible: Authentication procedures that 5G-RG and the 5GC shall support, are specified in TS 33.501 [11]. Specific EAP authentication methods (see TS 33.501 [11]) for 5G-CRG with non-3GPP identities and credentials may be used for isolated network (see TS 33.501 [11]).\nFigure 7.2.1.1-1: 5G-RG Registration via W-5GAN\n1.\tThe 5G-RG connects to a W-5GAN with procedures outside the scope of 3GPP and creates an initial signalling connection using W-CP protocol stack. This connection shall support transfer of AS parameters and NAS messages between 5G-RG and W-AGF.\n2.\tVoid.\n3.\tThe 5G-RG using W-CP protocol stack sends a message that contains the Access Network parameters (GUAMI if available, the selected PLMN or SNPN, Requested NSSAI and Establishment Cause) and a NAS Registration Request message (SUCI or 5G-GUTI as defined in TS 24.501 [22], security parameters/UE security capability, NSSAI parameters, UE MM Core Network Capability, PDU session status, Follow-on request). The Establishment cause provides the reason for requesting a signalling connection with 5GC.\nNOTE 1:\tWhile PLMN or SNPN selection is not supported for W-5GAN access, the 5G RG provides a selected PLMN or SNPN ID in Access Network parameters sent to the W-AGF. In this version of the specifications, this selected PLMN or SNPN ID is the home domain of the SUCI. This information is transparently transferred from 5G RG to AUSF via the W-AGF and the AMF; it ensures the AUSF and the 5G RG consider the same information for Key derivations defined in TS 33.501 [11].\nNOTE 2:\tThe steps from 1 to 3 depend on BBF decision for what protocols to use for NAS transport. The step needs to be revised based on their decision.\n4.\tThe W-AGF shall select an AMF based on the received AN parameters and local policy, as specified in clause 6.3.5 of TS 23.501 [2]. The W-AGF shall then forward the Registration Request received from the UE to the selected AMF within an N2 initial UE message (NAS message, ULI, Establishment cause, UE context request, selected PLMN or SNPN ID).\n5.\tThe selected AMF may decide to request the SUCI by sending a N2 Downlink NAS transport message (NAS Identity Request) message to W-AGF. This NAS message and the response are sent between W-AGF and 5G-RG as described in BBF TR-456 [43] and CableLabs WR‑TR‑5WWC‑ARCH [27]. In this case the RG shall answer with a NAS Identity response.\n6.\tThe AMF may decide to authenticate the 5G-RG by invoking an AUSF. In this case, the AMF shall select an AUSF as specified in TS 23.501 [2] clause 6.3.4 based on SUPI or SUCI. As defined in 33.501 [11], the AMF transfers the SUCI and the selected PLMN or SNPN ID to the AUSF.\nThe AUSF executes the authentication of the UE as specified in TS 33.501 [11]. The AUSF selects a UDM as described in clause 6.3.8 of TS 23.501 [2] and gets the authentication data from UDM. The authentication packets are encapsulated within NAS authentication messages. Between W-AGF and AMF, the messages are encapsulated within N2 downlink/uplink NAS transport messages. After the successful authentication the AUSF provides relevant security related information to the AMF. If the AMF provided a SUCI to AUSF, the AUSF shall return the SUPI to AMF only after the authentication is successful.\nThe AMF decides if the Registration Request needs to be rerouted as described in clause TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.2.2.2.3, where the initial AMF refers to the AMF.\n7a.\tIf NAS security context does not exist, the NAS security initiation is performed as described in TS 33.501 [11]: the AMF initiates NAS Security Mode command. If the 5G-RG had no NAS security context in step 1, the UE includes the full Registration Request message as defined in TS 24.501 [22]. If an EAP-AKA' authentication was successfully executed in step 6, the AMF shall encapsulate the EAP-Success received from AUSF within the NAS Security Mode Command message. The message is encapsulated within a N2 downlink NAS transport message.\nThe AMF initiates a NGAP/N2 procedure to provide the 5G-AN with security context as specified in TS 38.413 [23].\n7b.\tThe W-AGF shall forward the NAS Security Mode Command message to 5G-RG.\n7c.\tThe 5G-RG completes the authentication procedure (if initiated in step 6), creates a NAS security context as defined in TS 33.501 [11] and sends the NAS Security Mode Complete message (IMEISV) to the AMF.\n7d.\tThe W-AGF relays the NAS Security Mode Complete message to the AMF in a N2 Uplink NAS transport message.\n8.\t[Conditional] The AMF may request the PEI from the 5G-RG as described in clause 4.2.2.2.2, step 11 of TS 23.502 [3].\n9.\tThe AMF performs step 12-16 in TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.2.2.2.2. At AMF registration to UDM for the 5G-RG, the Access Type non-3GPP access is used. The RAT type used toward PCF and UDM shall indicate wireline access. The AMF determines Access Type and RAT Type based on the Global RAN Node ID associated with the N2 interface.\n10.\tThe AMF sends an N2 Initial Context Setup Request message as defined in TS 38.413 [23] and TS 29.413 [42] possibly including as additional W-AGF specific parameter the RG Level Wireline Access Characteristics.\n11a.\tVoid.\n11b.\tVoid.\n12.\tW-AGF notifies the AMF that the 5G-RG context was created by sending a N2 Initial Context Setup Response.\n13.\tThe AMF sends N2 Downlink NAS transport with the NAS Registration Accept message (as defined in step 21 TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.2.2.2.2) to the W-AGF, which forwards the NAS Registration accept message to the 5G-RG.\n14.\t[Conditional] The 5G-RG responds with NAS Registration Complete message as described in TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.2.2.2.2 step 22 and W-AGF forwards the NAS Registration Complete message to AMF in a N2 Uplink NAS transport message. The N2 Uplink NAS transport message to AMF may contain W-AGF identities. The AMF stores the received W-AGF identities in the UE context.\nNOTE 3:\tThe W-AGF identities contains a list of Identifiers (i.e. a list of FQDN and/or IP address(es)) of N3 terminations at W-AGF and can be used by SMF as input to select an UPF during PDU Session Establishment, as described in clauses 7.3.1.1 and 7.3.4.\n15.\tThe AMF performs step 23-24 in TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.2.2.2.2.",

How the W-AGF can determine the necessary 5GC and AN parameters is defined in BBF TR-456 [9], WT-457 [10] or CableLabs WR-TR-5WWC-ARCH [27].\n3.\tW-AGF performs initial registration on behalf of the FN-RG to the 5GC. The W-AGF sends a Registration Request to the selected AMF within an N2 initial UE message (NAS Registration Request, ULI, Establishment cause, UE context request, Allowed NSSAI, Authenticated Indication).\nThe NAS Registration Request contains the SUCI or 5G-GUTI of the FN-RG, security parameters/UE security capability, UE MM Core Network Capability, PDU Session Status, Follow-on request, Requested NSSAI. The 5G-GUTI, if available, has been received from the AMF during a previous registration and stored in W-AGF.\nThe NSSAI parameters are provided based on W-AGF configuration. Based on W-AGF configuration of the 5GC NAS parameters, one or multiple Requested S-NSSAI may be used; e.g. when the W-AGF has been configured to use a specific slice for RG management purposes.\nThe following differences exist, compared to 5G-RG case:\n-\tThe W-AGF use SUCI as defined in clause 4.7.3 and clause 4.7.4.\n-\tThe Authenticated Indication indicates to AMF and 5GC that the FN-RG has been authenticated by the access network.\nThe SUCI is built by the W-AGF based on:\n-\tIn the case of a BBF access: the GLI as defined in clause 4.7.8 together with an identifier of the Home network as described in TS 23.003 [14].\n-\tIn the case of a Cable access: the GCI as defined in clause 4.7.8 together with an identifier of the Home network as described in TS 23.003 [14].\nNOTE 1:\tFurther description for how W-AGF obtain parameters required in AS and NAS message e.g. to build the SUCI is defined in BBF TR-456 [9], WT-457 [10] and CableLabs WR-TR-5WWC-ARCH [27].\n4\tIf the AMF receives a SUCI, the AMF shall select an AUSF as specified in TS 23.501 [2] clause 6.3.4 based on SUCI. If 5G-GUTI is provided, there is no need to map SUCI to SUPI and steps 5-9 can be skipped.\n5.\tAMF sends an authentication request to the AUSF in the form of, Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate. It contains the SUCI of the FN-RG. It also contains an indication that the W-5GAN has authenticated the FN-RG.\n6.\tAUSF selects a UDM as described in clause 6.3.8 of TS 23.501 [2] and sends a Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Request to the UDM. It contains the SUCI of the FN-RG and indication that the W-5GAN has authenticated the FN-RG.\n7.\tUDM invokes the SIDF to map the SUCI to a SUPI.\n8.\tUDM sends a Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Response to the AUSF. It contains the SUPI corresponding to the SUCI. It also contains an indication that authentication is not required for the FN-RG.\n9.\tAUSF sends a Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response to the AMF. This response from AUSF indicates that authentication is successful. The response contains the SUPI corresponding to the SUCI.\nThe procedure described in TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.2.2.2.3 may apply (the AMF decides if the Registration Request needs to be rerouted, where the initial AMF refers to the AMF).\n10a.\tAMF initiates a NAS security mode command procedure upon successful authentication as defined in TS 33.501 [11].\nThe NAS security mode command is sent from the AMF to the W-AGF in a N2 Downlink NAS transport message.\n10b.\tW-AGF responds to the AMF with a NAS Security Mode Complete message in a N2 Uplink NAS transport message. A NAS security context is created between W-AGF and AMF.\n11.\tThe AMF performs steps 11-16 in TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.2.2.2.2.\nThe AMF may be configured by local policies to issue EIR check:\n-\tOnly if the PEI is an IMEI; or\n-\tOnly if the PEI is an IMEI or a user device trusted MAC address.\nThese local policies may be defined on a per RAT Type basis.\nAt FN-RG registration to UDM, the Access Type non-3GPP access is used. The UDM, based on Access and Mobility Subscription information authorizes the FN-RG to access the 5GC. For FN-CRG, the AMF compares the list of serving area restrictions it receives from the UDM against the ULI from the W-AGF to check if the location information is allowed for the FN-CRG, as defined in clause 9.5.1. The AMF may also interact with the PCF for obtaining the Access and Mobility policy for the FN-RG.\n12a.\tUpon receiving NAS Security Mode Complete, the AMF shall send an N2 Initial Context Setup Request message as defined in TS 38.413 [23] and TS 29.413 [42] including possibly as additional W-AGF specific parameter the RG Level Wireline Access Characteristics to the W-AGF.\n12b\tW-AGF notifies to the AMF that the FN-RG context was created by sending a N2 Initial Context Setup Response.\n13.\tThe AMF sends the N2 Downlink NAS transport with NAS Registration Accept message (5GS registration result, 5G-GUTI, Equivalent PLMNs or SNPNs, Non-3GPP TAI, Allowed NSSAI, Rejected NSSAI, Configured NSSAI, 5GS network feature support, network slicing indication, Non-3GPP de-registration timer value, Emergency number lists, SOR transport container, NSSAI inclusion mode) to the W-AGF.\nThe following parameters are ignored by the W-AGF if received from the AMF: Emergency number lists, SOR transport container, NSSAI inclusion mode.\nNOTE 2:\tFurther description on how W-AGF handles the parameters received from 5GC is provided in BBF TR-456 [9], WT-457 [10] and CableLabs WR-TR-5WWC-ARCH [27].\n14.\tThe W-AGF sends a N2 Uplink NAS transport message, including a NAS Registration Complete message, back to the AMF when the procedure is completed. The W-AGF shall store the 5G-GUTI to be able to send it in potential later NAS procedures.\n15.\tThe AMF performs step 23-24 in TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.2.2.2.2.\nThe W-AGF may continue by establishing PDU session(s) on behalf of the FN-RG.",

The cause indicated is cause from step 3 or a cause due to internal AMF event. This step is equivalent to step 2 in Figure 4.2.6-1 of TS 23.502 [3].\n5.\tIf the W-CP signalling connection and W-UP resources has not been released yet, the W-AGF releases the W-CP connection and W-UP resources with a procedure out of scope of 3GPP. The W-AGF sends to the 5G-RG the indication of the release reason if received in step 4.\n6.\tW-AGF to AMF: The W-AGF confirms the release of the 5G-RG-associated N2-logical connection by returning N2 UE Context Release Complete (list of PDU Session ID(s) with active N3 user plane) to the AMF as in step 4 defined in clause 4.2.6 of TS 23.502 [3].

After the AMF receives the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Response as in step 7 of TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.2.6, the AMF considers the N3 connection as released.

An authentication procedure is triggered. This can be done either by AUN3 device sending a EAPOL-start frame to the 5G-RG or 5G-RG receives a frame from an unknown MAC address. The 5G-RG receives a permanent identifier from the AUN3 device (e.g. an NAI in form of username@realm). If the realm part is different from the realm associated with the PLMN that the 5G-RG belongs to, the 5G-RG stops performing following procedure and reject the AUN3 device.\nNOTE:\tHow the 5G-RG is triggered to apply procedures for AUN3 devices is defined by BBF and/or CableLabs. For example, the realm of the NAI used by AUN3 device to contact the 5G-RG can be used as a trigger for 5G-RG to apply procedures for AUN3 devices.\n3.\tThis shall be same as step 3 of 7.2.1.1-1 with the following addition:\n-\tW-CP AN parameters may contain an indicator that the W-CP connection is for an AUN3 device;\n-\tThe 5G-RG always provides a SUCI as AUN3 device identity information in the registration request and constructs the SUCI from the NAI received within EAP-Identity issued by the AUN3 device as defined in TS 33.501 [11];\n-\tThe 5G-RG uses default values, which are the same for all AUN3 devices it serves, to populate the parameters in the Registration Request message built on behalf of an AUN3 device. For example, the 5G-RG issues the Registration Request with no S-NSSAI; and\n-\tWhen W-AGF provides (over N2) ULI to be associated with an AUN3 device, if the AUN3 device is connected behind a 5G-BRG, the W-AGF builds the AUN3's ULI using the ULI of the 5G-BRG connecting the AUN3 device. If AUN3 device is connected behind the 5G-CRG, the W-AGF builds the ULI using the GCI and HFC node ID of the 5G-CRG connecting the AUN3 device.\n4.\tThe W-AGF selects an AMF based on the received AN parameter provided by the 5G-RG and based on local policy, as specified in clause 6.3.5 of TS 23.501 [2]. The W-AGF shall determine that a W-CP connection is for an AUN3 device and apply corresponding policies.\nThe W-AGF sends an NGAP INITIAL UE message to the selected AMF. For an AUN3 device, the W-AGF indicates to AMF if the N2 connection relates to an AUN3 device and if there is an existing N2 connection for a 5G-RG connected to the same GLI/GCI (where the initial NAS message related with NGAP INITIAL UE message has been received).\nIf the W-AGF indicated for an AUN3 device that there is no existing 5G-RG N2 connection for a 5G-RG connected to the same GLI/GCI, then the AMF rejects the registration request and further steps of this procedure are skipped. Otherwise, the procedure continues.\n5.\tAMF selects AUSF as specified in clause 6.3.4 of TS 23.501 [2].\n6.\tThe AUSF executes the authentication of the AUN3 device following TS 33.501 [11]. The AUSF selects the UDM as described in clause 6.3.8 of TS 23.501 [2] and gets the authentication data of the AUN3 device, from UDM. EAP based authentication defined in TS 33.501 [11] is performed between the AUSF and the AUN3 device. Once the AUN3 device has been authenticated, the AUSF provides relevant security related information to the AMF. AUSF shall return the SUPI corresponding to the AUN3 device to AMF only after the authentication is successful.\n7.\tSame as steps 7 to 12 of figure 7.2.1.1-1 with following modifications:\n-\tIf step 7 of figure 7.2.1.1-1 is a NAS Security Mode Command, it uses NULL encryption and NULL integrity protection as described in TS 33.501 [11];\n-\tThe 5G RG uses the MAC address of the AUN3 device as a PEI.\n-\tThe AMF shall reject the registration request if the W-AGF indicates to AMF in step 4 that the N2 connection relates to an AUN3 device and the parameter \"AUN3 device connectivity allowed\" in the Access and Mobility Subscription Data is not present or it indicates that the device is not allowed to connect as an AUN3 device.\n8.\tThe AMF sends the Registration Accept message related to the AUN3 device to the 5G-RG. This step is executed over the NAS signalling connection and the N2 connection related to the AUN3 device.\n9.\tThe 5G-RG sends the Registration Complete message related to the AUN3 device to the AMF, when the procedure is completed. This step is executed over NAS signalling connection and N2 connection related to the AUN3 device. The 5G-RG shall store the 5G-GUTI of AUN3 device to be able to use it potential later NAS procedures related with the AUN3 device.\n10.\tThe 5G-RG receives the URSP corresponding to the AUN3 device and continues by requesting the establishment of a PDU Session on behalf of the AUN3 device as specified in clause 7.3.1.",

The procedure applies in non-roaming scenarios.\nThe PDU Session Establishment procedure specified in TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.3.2.2.1 applies with the following changes.\nFigure 7.3.1.1-1: 5G-RG PDU Session establishment via W-5GAN\n1.\tThe 5G-RG shall send a PDU Session Establishment Request message to AMF as specified in step 1 in clause 4.3.2.2.1 of TS 23.502 [3]. This message shall be sent to W-AGF via the W-CP signalling connection and the W-AGF shall transparently forward it in a N2 Uplink NAS transport message (NAS message, User location information, W-AGF identities) to AMF in the 5GC.\nThe W-AGF identities parameter may be included by the W-AGF and contains a list of Identifiers (i.e. a FQDN and/or IP address(es)) of N3 terminations at W-AGF and can be used by SMF in step 8 in TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.3.2.2.1 as input to select an UPF.\nIf the 5G-RG needs Hybrid Access with Multi-Access PDU Session service, the 5G-RG requests a MA PDU Session as defined in clause 4.12.

The means of carrying the IP address/prefix request/response between FN-BRG and W-AGF is defined in BBF TR-456 [9], WT-457 [10] and between FN-CRG and W-AGF is defined in CableLabes WR-TR-5WWC-ARCH [27].\n1.\tAfter the registration procedure is completed, the W-AGF may establish PDU session(s) on behalf of the FN-RG. The trigger for W-AGF to initiate a PDU establishment process is defined in BBF TR-456 [9], WT-457 [10] and CableLabs WR-TR-5WWC-ARCH [27].\nThe W-AGF generates a PDU session ID and derives the parameters for the PDU Session (PDU Session type, S-NSSAI, DNN, SSC mode, etc.) based on signalling received from the FN-RG (DHCP, IPv6 RS, etc.), on local configuration, and on information received from the 5GC (e.g. during the Registration procedure or when received URSP rules) and stored on the W-AGF.\nIf W-AGF has received a DHCPv4/DHCPv6 request from the FN-RG, it may request a PDU Session with deferred IP address allocation.\nThe W-AGF sends a NAS PDU Establishment Request to the AMF. This request contains the PDU Session ID, and may contain a Requested PDU Session Type, a Requested SSC mode, 5GSM Capability PCO, SM PDU DN Request Container, Number of Packet Filters. In the case of PDU Session Type IPv6 or IPv4v6, the PDU Session Establishment Request may contain an interface identifier of the FN-RG IPv6 link local address associated with the PDU Session.\nThe W-AGF sends NAS PDU Establishment Request in a N2 Uplink NAS transport message (NAS message, User location information, W-AGF identities).\nThe W-AGF identities contains a list of Identifiers (i.e. a FQDN and/or IP address(es)) of N3 terminations at W-AGF and can be used by SMF in step 8 in TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.3.2.2.1 as input to select an UPF.\n2a.\tThe PDU session request is processed in the 5GC as per steps 2-11 of TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.3.2.2.1. These steps are for UPF selection and resource reservation/allocation in the UPF. With regard to TS 23.502 [3], an additional parameter is sent from AMF to SMF i.e. the list of Identifiers (i.e. a FQDN and/or IP address(es)) of N3 terminations at W-AGF received by the AMF from the W-AGF. The SMF can use it in step 8 for UPF selection as per clause 4.3.2.2.1.

Therefore the URSP is used by a W-AGF on behalf of a FN-RG to determine the association of traffic from FN-RG with a PDU session to use for this traffic.\nUSRP rule enforcement reporting is not defined for FN-RG.\nURSP policy information applicable for 5G-RG (as defined in clause9.5.2.1) is also applicable for FN-RG devices except that for Traffic descriptor, only IP descriptors, and Non-IP descriptors are applicable.\nThe W-AGF shall ignore any of the information and policies not listed above if received from the 5GC.\nNOTE 1:\tThe FN-RG initiates the W-5GAN session with the W-AGF, for example PPPoE, and consequently the W-AGF does not receive any indication of the application used for that session (e.g. whether it used for web browsing or for any specific application) and any DNN indication from the application, hence the policy including the Application Descriptors and/or DNN will never match the traffic.\nIf the PCF sends UE policy (e.g. URSP), the W-AGF shall store it for the duration that FN-RG is registered. When the FN-RG is deregistered, the UE policy can be removed. Whether it is done immediately, or after a certain period (e.g. for quick recovery from disconnection or fault), or stored permanently it is left to implementation and is out of the scope of this TS.\nIf the URSP for the FN-RG are present in W-AGF (e.g. pre-configured or received from PCF) the W-AGF shall use them as defined for a UE with URSP.\nIf the URSP for the FN-RG are not present in W-AGF, the W-AGF acts based on local configuration, as defined for a UE without URSP.\nThe W-AGF requests PDU Sessions upon data trigger (e.g. PPPoE, DHCP, etc.) received over a data path identified by a VLAN and a GLI; this is defined in BBF specifications (BBF TR-456 [9] and BBF TR-470 [38]).\nThus the W-AGF needs to be configured to request different PDU Sessions for different VLAN(s) terminated at different FN RG(s).\nNOTE 2:\tThe VLAN configuration depends on the served FN RG as a W-AGF service area can serve different Wireline access networks with different VLAN configurations.\nThe corresponding W-AGF configuration about parameters of the PDU Sessions to request for a GLI corresponds to URSP that the W-AGF receives from the PCF for a SUPI corresponding to a GLI.\nThe URSP(s) may be used to map VLAN(s) at transport level (S-tags as defined in BBF TR-470 [38]) on the V interface of the W-AGF (identifying the target service of the corresponding data flows, e.g. internet / IMS Voice / IPTV) towards Route Selection components including PDU Session type, DNN, S-NSSAI, SSC mode, etc.\nNOTE 3:\tUDR policy data related with a FN-RG subscription (UE Policy Section, see clause 5.4.2.3 of TS 29.519 [39]) can be configured accordingly.\nIt is assumed that the FN-RG configuration (provided via BBF TR-069 [18]/BBF TR-369 [19]), the URSP rules and the local configuration in the W-AGF are consistent with each other. If the W-AGF detects conflicting requirements based on URSP, local configuration, or requests from the FN-RG, then the URSP rules takes precedence since they are considered the most updated and aligned to the current 5G system conditions.\nUE Policy procedures defined in clause 6.1.2.2 of TS 23.503 [4] are applicable with the following modification:\n-\tRoaming is not applicable to W-5GAN access in this release of specification.",

The UE can be connected to 5GC via untrusted non-3GPP access (via 5G-RG), NG-RAN or via both accesses.\nNOTE 1:\tThe reference architecture in figure A-1 only shows the architecture and the network functions directly connected to W-5GAN or N3IWF, and other parts of the architecture are the same as defined in TS 23.501 [2] clause 4.2.\nNOTE 2:\tThe reference architecture in figure A-1 supports service based interfaces for AMF, SMF and other NFs not represented in the figure.\nNOTE 3:\tThe two N2 instances in Figure A-1 apply to a single AMF for a 5G-RG which is simultaneously connected to the same 5G Core Network over 3GPP access and Wireline 5G Access Network.\nNOTE 4:\tThe UE can as well be registered and connected via 3GPP access.\nFigure A-2: Non-roaming architecture for UE behind FN-RG using untrusted N3GPP access\nThe FN-RG can be connected to 5GC via W-5GAN The UE can be connected to 5GC via untrusted non-3GPP access (via FN-RG), NG-RAN or via both accesses.\nNOTE 5:\tThe reference architecture in figure A-2 only shows the architecture and the network functions directly connected to Wireline 5G Access Network or N3IWF, and other parts of the architecture are the same as defined in clause 4.2 of TS 23.501 [2].\nNOTE 6:\tThe reference architecture in figure A-2 supports service based interfaces for AMF, SMF and other NFs not represented in the figure.\nNOTE 7:\tFor untrusted non-3GPP access, UE connects to the overlay 5G network using the untrusted non-3GPP access approach as illustrated above.\nAnnex B (informative):Support for differentiated charging and QoS for UEs behind RG\nFor the traffic of UEs behind a RG, QoS differentiation in the RG's PDU Session can be provided on a per UE's IPsec Child Security Association basis. The UE's N3IWF/TNGF determines the IPsec child SAs as defined in clauses 4.12 and 4.12a of TS 23.502 [3] as well as the DSCP value used in the outer IP header of that IPsec child SA. It is assumed that the same set of DSCP values and corresponding QoS are applicable independent of whether UE-requested or network-initiated QoS is used.\nTo support QoS differentiation for the UE's traffic, QoS mapping rules between the RG's 5GC and the UE's 5GC are governed by an SLA (or network configuration in case of single operator), which includes the mapping between the DSCP marking for the IPsec child SAs and the corresponding QoS parameters and also the N3IWF/TNGF IP address(es). The non-alteration of the DSCP field on NWu/NWt is also governed by the SLA and by transport-level arrangements that are outside of 3GPP scope. The SLA also governs the RG PDU session IP addresses.\nThe RG's PCF and SMF may provide PCC rules and QoS rules for the available mappings as determined by the SLA. The packet detection filters in the RG's UPF can be based on the N3IWF/TNGF IP address and the DSCP markings on NWu/NWt.\nUE's SMF/PCF may use the UE's local IP address, which is the N6 address of the RG's PDU session, to enable differentiated QoS and charging when the UE is accessing N3IWF/TNGF via a W-5GAN.\nDifferentiated charging is enabled by the awareness of N3IWG/TNGF and RG PDU Session IP addresses and also the mapping between DSCP marking and QoS parameters included in the SLA.\nAnnex C (informative):Change history\nChange
