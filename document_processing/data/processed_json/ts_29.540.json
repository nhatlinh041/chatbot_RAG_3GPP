The example does not aim to be a complete representation of the HTTP message, e.g. additional information or headers can be included.\nThis Annex is informative and the normative descriptions in this specification prevail over the description in this Annex if there is any difference.\nB.2\tVoid\nB.3\tExample HTTP multipart message with SMS binary data\nExample HTTP multipart message with SMS binary data:\nPOST /example.com/nsmsf-sms/v1/ue-contexts/{supi}/sendsms HTTP/2\nContent-Type: multipart/related; boundary=----Boundary\nContent-Length: xyz\n------Boundary\nContent-Type: application/json\n{\n\"smsRecordId\": \"777c3edf-129f-486e-a3f8-c48e7b515605\",\n\"smsPayload\": {\n\"contentId\": \"sms\"\n},\n\"gpsi\": \"msisdn-8613915900000\",\n\"pei\": \"imei-123456789012345\",\n\"accessType\": \"3GPP_ACCESS\",\n\"ueLocation\": {\n\"nrLocation\": {\n\"tai\": {\n\"plmnId\": {\n\"mcc\": \"46\",\n\"mnc\": \"000\"\n},\n\"tac\": \"A01001\",\n\"ncgi\": {\n\"plmnId\": {\n\"mcc\": \"46\",\n\"mnc\": \"000\"\n},\n\"nrCellId\": \"225BD6007\"\n}\n}\n},\n\"ueTimeZone\": \"+08:00\"\n}\n------Boundary\nContent-Type: application/vnd.3gpp.sms\nContent-Id: sms\n{ … SMS Message binary data …}\n------Boundary\nThe JSON part of the HTTP POST message includes an attribute named \"smsPayload\" which refers to RefToBinaryData structure.
