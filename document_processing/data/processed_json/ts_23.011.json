      "content": "In order to provide a tool to define service states the concept of a \"state vector\" is introduced. The state vector is used to represent the state of the service in terms of four variables:\n1)\tProvisioning State,\npossible values are \"Provisioned\" or \"Not Provisioned\";\n2)\tRegistration State,\npossible values are \"Registered\", \"Erased\", or \"Not Applicable\";\n3)\tActivation State,\npossible values are \"Not Active\", \"Active and Operative\" or \"Active and Quiescent\";\n4)\tHLR Induction State,\npossible values are \"Induced\" or \"Not Induced\".\nThe state vector represents the state of the service by using all four variables together. The state vector is represented using the notation:\n(Provisioning State, Registration State, Activation State, HLR Induction State)\ne.g.: (Provisioned, Registered, Not Active, Not Induced).\nNote that the state vector is a logical (not a physical) representation of the service state. Note also that though some parts of the state vector are similar to elements of SS‑Status the mapping between the state vector and SS‑Status is not one to one. The use of state vectors is not intended to specify any particular implementation internally in a node. There is a relationship specified between the state vector and parts of the transfer syntax. This relationship is not a direct one‑to‑one mapping.\nThe following text specifies the semantics of each variable in the state vector.\nThe three variables \"Provisioning State\", \"Registration State\" and \"Activation State\" are used to represent the state of the service according to the normal behaviour based on service provider and user actions.\nThe \"HLR Induction State\" records whether or not the HLR has temporarily induced the service (e.g. if the VLR does not support CUG, the HLR may induce an outgoing barring service). The Provisioning State, Registration State and Activation State are not affected by HLR induction of a service.\nProvisioning State\n‑\thas value \"provisioned\", if the subscriber has a subscription to the service;\n‑\thas value \"Not Provisioned\" otherwise.\nRegistration State\n‑\thas value \"Not Applicable\", if registration is not applicable to the service;\n‑\thas value \"Registered\", if registration is applicable, and there is registration data available;\n‑\thas value \"Erased\" otherwise.\nActivation State\n‑\thas value \"Active and Operative\", if the service is in a state where it can be invoked (and this is not due to HLR induction);\n‑\thas value \"Active and Quiescent\", if the service is in a state where it cannot be invoked, but where it will automatically move to the \"Active and Operative\" state when conflicting conditions are removed;\n‑\thas value \"Not Active\" otherwise.\nHLR Induction State\n‑\thas the value \"Induced\" if the HLR has induced the service (e.g. if the VLR does not support CUG, the HLR may induce an outgoing barring service);\n‑\thas the value \"Not Induced\" otherwise.\nFor further information about how HLR induction applies to particular services refer to the 3GPP TS 23.08x and 23.09x‑series.",

This option is applicable only for the CS domain. These services are referenced in the following as protected supplementary services.\nThe password is stored in the HLR only.\nIt has to be memorised by the network, if a wrong password has been used. Therefore, the HLR stores the value of the Wrong Password Attempts counter (WPA).\nIf a password check is done with an incorrect password, the WPA is incremented by one. If a password check is passed, WPA is set to zero. If WPA exceeds the value three, the subscription option \"control of supplementary service\" is set to \"by the service provider\". This makes registration of password and activation or deactivation of protected supplementary services impossible (see 3GPP TS 22.004).\nWhen the service provider registers a password, the WPA is set to zero.\nWhen an attempt to perform an operation requiring a password is received by the network, the network has to check whether the requesting subscriber has subscribed to the option \"control of supplementary service by subscriber using password\". This is shown in figure 3.1 (function PW1).\nIf this option has the value \"by the service provider\" the WPA has to be checked. When WPA exceeds three, then more than three attempts with a wrong password have been made and the appropriate message will be sent to the user. If the value of WPA is less than or equal to three, then the subscriber has not subscribed to \"control of supplementary service by subscriber using password\".\nWhen a password is supplied, it has to be checked, whether it is identical to the one stored. If this applies, then WPA is reset to zero. Otherwise WPA is incremented by one and dependent of the value of the counter, the network shall request the password again, or shall send and error message and update the subscription option as shown in figure 3.2 (function PW2).\nAfter the input of a wrong password more than three consecutive times, the only possibility to reset the Wrong Password Attempts counter (WPA) is, to register a new password by the service provider.\nFigures 3.3 and 3.4 show the procedures executed by the network in order to check the format (function PW3) and to check the new password (function PW4).\nFigure 3.1: PW1; Check of subscription option (HLR)\nFigure 3.2: PW2; Check of password input (HLR)\nFigure 3.3: PW3; Format check (HLR)\nFigure 3.4: PW4; Check of new password (HLR)",
