      "content": "7.1.2.3.1.1.1\tGeneral\nA pre-arranged group call is initiated by one of the affiliated group members. The initiation of a pre-arranged group call results in all other affiliated group members being invited. Media plane resources are reserved (on-demand) or a pre-established session is associated during the group call setup procedure and released (if on-demand session) or de-associated (if pre-established session) when the call is released. SIP signalling is used to setup and release pre-arranged group calls.\n7.1.2.3.1.1.2\tPre-arranged group call setup\nThe procedure enables the scenario where an MCVideo client is initiating an MCVideo group call with unicast signalling for communicating with the affiliated members of that group.\nProcedures in figure 7.1.2.3.1.1.2-1 are the signalling control plane procedures for the MCVideo client initiating establishment of an MCVideo group call with a pre-arranged group i.e., MCVideo users on client 1, client 2 and client 3 belong to the same group which is defined in the group management server.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tA pre-arranged group is an MCVideo group that is pre-defined with MCVideo group ID and member list in the group management server. All members of the group belong to the same MC system.\n2.\tIt is assumed that MCVideo users on MCVideo client 1, MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo client 3 are already registered for receiving MCVideo service and affiliated.\n3.\tThe MCVideo client 1 may have an activated functional alias to be used.\n4.\tThe MCVideo server may have subscribed to the MCVideo functional alias controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-activation updates.\n5.\tThe MCVideo user on MCVideo client 1 may have bound a functional alias to the MCVideo group ID (3GPP TS 23.280 [6]).\nFigure 7.1.2.3.1.1.2-1: Pre-arranged group call setup\n1.\tUser at MCVideo client 1 would like to initiate an MCVideo group call with a selected group (identified by MCVideo group ID). The MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 may include a functional alias used within the MCVideo group call.\nNOTE 1:\tThe selected functional alias is not changed during the group call, i.e. a MCVideo client uses the same functional alias until the group call is released or the MCVideo client has left the group call.\n2.\tMCVideo client 1 sends a group call request towards the MCVideo server via the SIP core, which hosts the group selected by the user and identified by MCVideo group ID. The group call request also contains the MCVideo group ID and an SDP offer containing the MCVideo client media parameters. If the MC service user of MCVideo client 1 has selected a functional alias, then the group call request contains that functional alias. If there is a transmit media request, then the group call request contains an indication for the implicit transmit media request. If the group call request contains an implicit transmit media request it may also include location information.\n3.\tMCVideo server checks whether the user of MCVideo client 1 is authorized to initiate a group call for the selected group. If a functional alias is present, the MCVideo server checks whether it is allowed to be used and if it has been activated for the user. If authorized and the group call is ongoing for that MCVideo group ID, the MCVideo server adds the requesting MCVideo client 1 to the existing MCVideo group call and notifies the MCVideo client 1 that the MCVideo group call is already in progress. Otherwise, MCVideo server resolves the MCVideo group ID to determine the members of that group and their affiliation status, based on the information from the group management server.\nIf the functional alias is provided only in the group call request, or via binding, the MCVideo server proceeds with the value that is provided. If the functional alias is provided in both the group call request and via binding, it is up to the MCVideo server implementation to determine a value for the functional alias to be used.\nNOTE 2:\tMCVideo server can have already retrieved the user/group configuration data and locally cached. If the user/group configuration data is not locally cached on the MCVideo server then MCVideo server requests the user/group configuration data from the MCVideo user database/group management server.\n4.\tMCVideo server includes information that it communicates using MCVideo service, offers the same media parameters or a subset of the media parameters contained in the initial received request and sends the corresponding group call request via the SIP core towards the MCVideo clients of each of those affiliated group members. MCVideo users are notified about the incoming group call and, if present, the functional alias of the initiating MC service user is displayed. The MCVideo server indicates whether acknowledgement is required for the call.\n5.\tThe receiving MCVideo clients accept the group call request, and a group call response is sent to the group host MCVideo server. This response may contain an acknowledgement. The conditions for sending acknowledgement may be based on configuration.\n6.\tMCVideo server sends the group call response including the selected media parameters to the MCVideo client 1 through the signalling path to inform about successful call establishment.\nNOTE 3:\tStep 6 can occur at any time following step 4b, and prior to step 7 depending on the conditions to proceed with the call.\n7.\tIf the initiating MCVideo user requires the acknowledgement from affiliated MCVideo group members, and the required MCVideo group members do not acknowledge the call setup within a configured time (the \"acknowledged call setup timeout\"), then the MCVideo server may proceed with or abandon the call and then notify the initiating MCVideo user that the acknowledgements did not include all required members according to group policy. This notification may be sent to the initiating MCVideo user by the MCVideo server more than once during the call when MCVideo users join or leave the MCVideo group call.\n8.\tMCVideo client 1, client 2 and client 3 have successfully established media plane and transmission control for communication.\n7.1.2.3.1.1.3\tRelease pre-arranged group call\nThe procedure enables the scenario where an MCVideo server initiates the termination of an ongoing MCVideo group call for all the participants of that group call, since at least one of the termination conditions are met e.g., last participant leaving, second last participant leaving, initiator leaving, or minimum number of affiliated MCVideo group members are not present.\nProcedures in figure 7.1.2.3.1.1.3-1 are the signalling control plane procedures for the MCVideo server initiating termination of an ongoing MCVideo group call.\nFigure 7.1.2.3.1.1.3-1: Release pre-arranged group call\n1.\tIt is assumed that MCVideo users on MCVideo client 1, client 2 and client 3 are already part of the ongoing group call (e.g., as a result of pre-arranged group call setup).\n2.\tMCVideo server would like to release the MCVideo group call which is ongoing e.g., last participant leaving, initiator leaving, or minimum number of affiliated group members are not present.\n3.\tMCVideo server identifies the participants of the ongoing group call and generates group call release request to release ongoing session.\n4.\tMCVideo server sends a group call release request via SIP core towards each participant of the ongoing group call.\n5.\tMCVideo users are notified about the release of the group call.\n6.\tMCVideo client(s) receiving group call release request, acknowledge towards the MCVideo server by sending a group call release response.\n7.

      "content": "7.1.2.3.1.2.1\tGeneral\nIn a chat group (restricted) call model, the MCVideo user individually joins a group call without being explicitly invited by the MCVideo server. The establishment of a chat group (restricted) call does not result in other group members being invited.\nFigure 7.1.2.3.1.2.2-1 describes the basic procedure for the MCVideo client initiating an MCVideo group call which uses the chat group (restricted) call model. The chat group (restricted) call model can be used to realize the video conferencing service where only users that have been configured as participants for the video conferencing group are allowed to join the group communications for the given group.\nChat group join mechanism:\n-\tEach MCVideo client sends a group join request when the MCVideo user wants to participate in the group communication for the group. (This message does not impact the MCVideo user's membership in the group; the MCVideo server will verify that the MCVideo user is an authorized member of the group.)\n-\tThe group join request may include a transmit media request. If the group join request includes a request to transmit media it may also include location information. It is assumed that the group join request will be delivered from MCVideo client to MCVideo server using SIP.\n-\tIf location information was included in the group join request, the MCVideo server checks the privacy policy of the MCVideo user to decide if the location information of MCVideo client 1 can be provided to other users on the call.\n-\tThe group join request is used to indicate to the MCVideo server that the MCVideo user associated with the given MCVideo client wishes to participate (begin to receive notifications for media transmissions) from the group.\n-\tThe group join request shall cause the MCVideo server to generate an implicit affiliation for the MCVideo user to the group, if the user is not already affiliated to the group.\n-\tThe group join request contains the information needed to negotiate media parameters (on demand) or to associate a pre-established session between MCVideo server and MCVideo client for the group call. The group join request can take the form of a SIP invite.\n-\tA selected functional alias is not changed by a MCVideo client during the whole participation within a chat group call, i.e. a MCVideo client uses the same functional alias selected when joining the chat group call until the chat group call is released or the MCVideo client leaves the chat group call.\nSubsequent participation in a group call when the group is using the chat model:\n-\tOnce an MCVideo client successfully joins a group call which is using the chat model, the MCVideo client connects to the media plane for the media transmission if the media transmission is currently ongoing.\n-\tIf the MCVideo group call is not currently ongoing (i.e.: when MCVideo clients on the group call are not sending or receiving media, and the time out between transmission control exchanges has expired) then the newly joined MCVideo client will only have pre-established its media parameters for the call.\n-\tIf the newly joined MCVideo user wishes to transmit media to the other joined users of the group using the chat model, then the MCVideo client shall use a normal transmission control procedure for transmitting the media.\n-\tSubsequent group call media transmissions are controlled using transmission control signalling.\n-\tThe MCVideo server may tear down the media plane between successive group calls using the chat model, or the MCVideo server may allow the media plane to remain up between successive group calls using the chat model depending on resources.\nLeaving and releasing a chat group:\n-\tWhen a user wants to leave a chat group call, the client shall send a group call leave request to the server and release the media plane.\n-\tThe server can release a chat group call by sending a group call release to all joined clients. A server initiated release also releases the media plane for all joined clients.\n7.1.2.3.1.2.2\tChat group call setup\nMCVideo client 1, client 2, and client 3 are served by the home MCVideo service provider in figure 7.1.2.3.1.2.2-1.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tMCVideo user 2 and MCVideo user 3 have previously joined (affiliated) to the group call.

This may include a transmit media request.\n1a.\tMCVideo client 1 sends a group join request with the MCVideo group ID of the desired group. It contains the MCVideo user's MCVideo ID and the MCVideo client media parameters. The MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 may include a functional alias used within the MCVideo group join request. If there is a request for media transmission, then the group join request contains an indication of an implicit transmit media request. If the group join request includes an implicit transmit media request it may also include location information.\n1b.\tThe MCVideo server receives the group join request. MCVideo server generates an implicit affiliation (if the MCVideo user is not already affiliated to the group) and verifies that MCVideo user 1 is authorized to affiliate to the group by following the affiliation procedure for MCVideo.

      "content": "The off-network imminent peril group communication is a special case of off-network (non-imminent peril) group communication as defined in subclause 7.1.3.2, subclause 7.1.3.3, subclause 7.1.3.4, subclause 7.1.3.5, subclause 7.1.3.6 and subclause 7.1.3.7. The following are modifications to the aforementioned subclauses to support MCVideo imminent peril communications:\n-\tAs a pre-condition, the user initiating the imminent peril communication has previously been provisioned with an MCVideo group to be used as the MCVideo imminent peril group. The MCVideo client initiates MCVideo imminent peril group communications on this group. Alternatively, the MCVideo client could have been provisioned for imminent peril behaviour on the selected MCVideo group.\n-\tThe group communication announcement contains an indication that the MCVideo group communication is to be an MCVideo imminent peril communication. Group communication participants learn of the MCVideo group's in-progress imminent peril condition from the indication.\n-\tThe MCVideo group in-progress imminent peril state is considered cancelled when the communication ends.\n-\tThe MCVideo user who initiated the in-progress imminent peril communication or upgraded the group communication to imminent peril group communication, or an authorized user may cancel the in-progress imminent peril state with an MCVideo imminent peril group communication cancel message. The message is sent to the communication participants.\n-\tWhen the MCVideo group is no longer in the in-progress imminent peril state, every MCVideo client returns the value of ProSe Per Packet Priority to its default value.\n-\tAn in-progress MCVideo group communication is upgraded to an imminent peril group communication when the periodic group communication announcement contains the imminent peril indicator.\n-\tThe value of ProSe Per Packet Priority is upgraded according to imminent peril state of MCVideo group communication.\n-\tThe MCVideo group remains in the in-progress imminent peril state until the imminent peril group communication ends or the in-progress imminent peril state is cancelled.",

      "content": "The procedure is for providing transmission control to MCVideo UE in an off-network case. Transmission control is performed by using transmission control information flows between the transmission control participant and the transmission control arbitrator. The transmission control arbitrator is a member MCVideo UE of the MCVideo group where the transmission rules are applied.\nOff-network transmission control is based on ProSe capabilities as described in clause 7.18.\nTransmission control in off-network can be performed in two ways:\n-\tSingle arbitrator: transmission participants rely on a single participant designated as transmission arbitrator for the arbitraton of transmission requests.\n-\tSelf arbitration: each transmsission participant arbitrates its own transmission based on its view of the topology.\nBoth of the approaches, as appropriate for the deployment model, can be adopted for MCVideo group using a configurable parameter (as defined in Annex A.4).\nIn the single arbitrator approach, one MCVideo client assumes the responsibility for arbitration of transmission requests for all group members within range. All requests for transmission are directed to the arbitrator, and the arbitrator checks the configured limits on the simultaneous transmissions, and grants or denies the request. If an MCVideo client is out of range of the current arbitrator, the MCVideo client is allowed to transmit and also become a transmission arbitrator.  If there is insufficient capacity to carry an extra transmission i.e. the configured limit for simultaneous transmissions is reached, the MCVideo client may request that an existing transmitting MCVideo client is pre-empted; the pre-emption request is sent to the transmission arbitrator.\nIn the self arbitration approach, each MCVideo client decides for itself whether there is sufficient capacity to carry the transmission. If it determines that there is insufficient capacity i.e. the configured limit for simultaneous transmissions is reached, and from its perspective another transmitting MCVideo client has a lower priority, the requesting MCVideo client may send an override request directly to this other transmitting MCVideo client, which will either accept the override request and give way, or deny the override request.\nIn both the single arbitrator approach and the self arbitration approach, if there is insufficient capacity to carry the communication i.e. the configured limit on the simultaneous transmissions is reached, the MCVideo client may report this to the MCVideo user. The MCVideo user may decide to transmit anyway, and instruct the MCVideo client to proceed with the transmission.\nNOTE:\tThe ProSe function within the MCVideo client could determine that there is insufficient capacity to carry an MCVideo call requested by the MCVideo client, however interactions between the MCVideo client and the ProSe function are outside the scope of the present document.\nFurther subclauses apply to one or both of the single arbitrator approach and the self arbitration approach. Applicability is explicitly indicated in each of the relevant subclauses.",

This is left for the implementation.\nFigure 7.19.3.1.1-1: Ad hoc group call setup\n1.\tUser at MCVideo client 1 would like to initiate an ad hoc group call. The MCVideo client 1 initiates the ad hoc group call by sending the ad hoc group call request containing the list of participants or an ad hoc group ID from an ad hoc group emergency alert to the MCVideo server. Encryption supported information element shall be set to true since end-to-end encryption is supported. An SDP offer containing the MCVideo client media parameters is included. If there is a transmit media request to transmit media, then the ad hoc group call request contains an indication of an implicit transmit media request. If the MCVideo user of MCVideo client 1 has selected a functional alias, then the ad hoc group call request contains that functional alias. If the ad hoc group call request contains an implicit transmit media request it may also include location information.\nIf the MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 initiates an MCVideo emergency ad hoc group call or the MCVideo emergency state is already set for the MCVideo client 1 (due to a previously triggered MCVideo emergency alert):\ni.\tthe MCVideo ad hoc group call request shall contain an emergency indicator;\nii.\tif the MCVideo emergency state is not set already, MCVideo client 1 sets its MCVideo emergency state.

The configuration data in each configuration category corresponds to a single instance of the category type i.e. the MCVideo UE, MCVideo group, MCVideo user and MCVideo service configuration data refers to the information that will be stored against each MCVideo UE, MCVideo group, MCVideo user and MCVideo service. This means that the three separate tables (on-network and off-network, on-network only, off-network only) for each configuration category represent the complete set of data for each configuration data category element.\nThe columns in the tables have the following meanings:\n-\tReference: the reference of the corresponding requirement in 3GPP TS 22.281 [3] or 3GPP TS 22.280 [2] or the corresponding subclause from either the present document or the referenced document.\n-\tParameter description: A short definition of the semantics of the corresponding item of data, including denotation of the level of the parameter in the configuration hierarchy.\n-\tWhen it is not clear to which functional entities the parameter is configured, then one or more columns indicating this are provided where the following nomenclature is used:\n-\t\"Y\" to denote \"Yes\" i.e. the parameter denoted for the row needs to be configured to the functional entity denoted for the column.\n-\t\"N\" to denote \"No\" i.e. the parameter denoted for the row does not need to be configured to the functional entity denoted for the column.\nParameters within a set of configuration data have a level within a hierarchy that pertains only to that configuration data. The hierarchy of the configuration data is common across all three tables of on-network and off-network, on network only and off network only. The level of a parameter within the hierarchy of the configuration data is denoted by use of the character \">\" in the parameter description field within each table, one per level. Parameters that are at the top most level within the hierarchy have no \">\" character. Parameters that have one or more \">\" characters are child parameters of the first parameter above them that has one less \">\" character. Parent parameters are parameters that have one or more child parameters. Parent parameters act solely as a \"grouping\" of their child parameters and therefore do not contain an actual value themselves i.e. they are just containers for their child parameters.\nEach parameter that can be configured online shall only be configured through one online reference point. Each parameter that can be configured offline shall only be configured through one offline reference point. The most recent configuration data made available to the MCVideo UE shall always overwrite previous configuration data, irrespective of whether the configuration data was provided via the online or offline mechanism.\nA.2\tMCVideo UE configuration data\nThe general aspects of UE configuration are specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [6]. Data in tables A.2-1 and A.2-2 have to be known by the MCVideo UE after MCVideo authorization.\nData in table A.2-1 can be configured offline using the CSC-11 reference point. Table A.2-1 contains the UE configuration required to support the use of off-network MCVideo service.\nTable A.2-1: UE configuration data (on and off network)\nReference\nParameter description\n[R-5.4.2-002] of 3GPP TS 22.280 [2]\nMaximum number of simultaneous MCVideo group calls (Nc4)\n[R-5.4.2-003] of 3GPP TS 22.280 [2]\nMaximum number of video transmissions (Nc5) in a group\nTable A.2-2: UE configuration data (on network)\nReference\nParameter description\nSubclause 5.2.3 of 3GPP TS 23.280 [6]\nRelay service (Y/N)\nSubclause 5.2.3 of 3GPP TS 23.280 [6]\nList of allowed relayed MCVideo groups and their relay service code (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7]) (optional) (see NOTE)\n> MCVideo group ID\n> Relay service code (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7])\nNOTE:\tWhen the value of the parameter Relay service is N, this parameter and its child parameters are not needed.\nA.3\tMCVideo user profile configuration data\nThe general aspects of MC service user profile configuration data are specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [6]. The MCVideo user profile configuration data is stored in the MCVideo user database. The MCVideo server obtains the MCVideo user profile configuration data from the MCVideo user database (MCVideo-2).\nTables A.3-1 and A.3-2 contain the MCVideo user profile configuration required to support the use of on-network MCVideo service. Tables A.3-1 and A.3-3 contain the MCVideo user profile configuration required to support the use of off-network MCVideo service.
