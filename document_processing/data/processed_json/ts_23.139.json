      "content": "The interworking architecture is based on EPC reference architecture defined in TS 23.401 [2] and TS 23 402 [3] and on BBF access network defined by BBF TR-291 [30], BBF TR-058 [7], BBF TR-101 [8], BBF TR-134 [11], and BBF TR-203 [6] excluding EAP-SIM (RFC 4186 [31]) functionality.\nThe interworking architecture supports trusted and untrusted model for the host-based mobility (S2c) and the untrusted model for the network based mobility (S2b). The trusted/untrusted Non-3GPP access network detection is performed as defined in clause 4.1.4 of TS 23 402 [3].\nThe reference architecture defined in TS 23 402 Rel‑11 clause 16 for Trusted WLAN using GTP s2a is applicable to the scenario where the Fixed Broadband / BBF Access network is considered as a trusted WLAN access. For such Fixed Broadband / BBF Access interworking deployments, in this version of the specification, the interactions between the EPC and the Fixed Broadband / BBF Access network consists only in S2a, STa interfaces and are not further detailed in this document. The detailed functional split within a Fixed Broadband / BBF Access network, the support of P2P link between the UE and the TWAG and the mapping between the S2a bearer QoS information received via S2a and Fixed Broadband Access specific parameters are outside 3GPP scope.\nThe architecture supports a UE simultaneously connected to the EPC via more than one access network for the same PDN connection as defined in TS 23.261 [9].\nThe architecture supports a UE that is capable of routing simultaneously active PDN connections to different APNs through different access networks as defined in TS 23.401 [2] and TS 23 402 [3].\nThe architecture supports the scenario of a single network operator deploying both the 3GPP EPC and the BBF access network and the scenario of two network operators one deploying the 3GPP EPC network and one deploying only the Broadband Forum Access network. Furthermore the architecture supports the roaming scenario between two PLMN operators.\nThe architecture supports local breakout of traffic in the EPC network whether a roaming subscriber is accessing the EPC via a 3GPP or a non-3GPP access network according to the design principles described in clause 4.1 of TS 23.401 [2].\nThe support of HeNB is based on reference architecture defined in TS 23.401 [2] and TS 36.300 [13], for the support of HNB in TS 23.060 [22] and TS 25.467 [12].\nThe architecture supports both offline and online charging in the 3GPP domain for the EPC routed traffic by means of accounting/charging information collected in 3GPP network elements.\nThe architecture supports STa/SWa reference points based accounting for the 3GPP UEs when traffic is NSWO in the Fixed Broadband Access network based on the assumption that the BBF network is able to collect per user accounting data for NSWO traffic of 3GPP UEs (i.e. BNG is able to recognize the traffic of individual 3GPP UEs), and periodically report this data via the STa/SWa reference points. If both EPC routed and NSWO are simultaneously provided to a UE, accounting information sent by BBF over SWa/STa shall allow distinguishing the accounting information for EPC routed traffic from that for NSWO traffic. This shall be supported based on Fixed Broadband Access accounting capabilities\nNOTE 1:\tAs defined in BBF TR-203 [6] the Fixed Aroadband Access may sent over SWa/STa accounting information for both EPC routed and NSWO.\nNOTE 2:\tThe online charging may be supported with limitation due to support of AAA RADIUS based accounting in the BBF network. It is assumed that the BBF does not need to be aware of whether online or offline charging is performed in the 3GPP domain\nFor S2b, the PCRF discovery function may select different PCRFs for PDN connection(s) for the UE in the PDN GW and for the IP session for NSWO traffic for the UE in the Fixed Broadband Access.\nFor S2c, the PCRF discovery function selects the same PCRF for all PDN connections for a certain IMSI and may select a different PCRF for IP-CAN session establishment over S9a for NSWO traffic.\nThere may be multiple TDFs deployed. If a TDF is used for traffic offloaded to the Fixed Broadband Access, the TDF selected for the NSWO traffic from the UE in the Fixed Broadband Access and that for the EPC routed traffic on SGi may or may not be the same.\nIn this Release, the policy interworking for user charging for NSWO traffic is only supported for scenarios without NAT in the Fixed Broadband Access domain.",

The solution assumes functionality in the BBF domain, all these functions are out-of-scope for 3GPP; also, these functions may or may not be implemented depending on the agreement between 3GPP and Fixed Broadband Access operator, these functions are described for information only.\nFixed Broadband Access network currently supports the DSCP marking as specified in BBF TR-092 [20] for BRAS, in BBF TR‑101 [8] for Access Nodes and Aggregation Nodes and in BBF TR-124 Issues 2 [21] for the RG.\nFigure 6.3.1-1: Packet classification and packet forwarding treatment in a 3GPP-Fixed Broadband Access interworking scenario for traffic routed to EPC\nFigure 6.3.1-2: Packet classification and packet forwarding treatment in a 3GPP-Fixed Broadband Access interworking scenario for NS-WLAN offload traffic\nThe figure 6.3.1-1 and the figure 6.3.1-2 are simplified and the intermediate transport network entities in both figures are not shown. The details of traffic handling in the Fixed Broadband Access domain are out of 3GPP scope.\nIn order to support QoS in Fixed Broadband Access:\n-\tThe BPCF needs to map the QoS information (QCI, bit rates, ARP) received over S9a to access-specific parameters applicable in the Fixed Broadband Access network as specified in TR-203 [6].\n-\tThe BRAS/BNG can perform QoS treatment and QoS remapping based on DSCP value of the outer IP header as specified in BBF TR-059 [26]. For NS-WLAN offload traffic, the BRAS/BNG can support per-flow DSCP marking on each packet based on the QoS information received via R interface.\n-\tThe RG can perform QoS treatment and QoS remapping based on DSCP value of the outer IP header based on pre-provisioned rules in the RG as specified in BBF TR-059 [26].\n-\tFor both EPC routed traffic and NS-WLAN offload traffic cases, if the UE implements reflective QoS and the Fixed Broadband Access network needs to be protected from a misbehaving UE, Fixed Broadband Access needs to implement protective measures (e.g. per-UE bandwidth limitation in the RG or in the BNG).\n-\tThe decision to apply Reflective QoS is performed as part of the AAA signalling for UE authentication.

      "content": "For the WLAN case, including EPC-routed traffic and NS-WLAN offload traffic, DSCP marking may be performed by the UE by means of reflective QoS. The UE creates a 5-tuple rule from the corresponding downlink 5-tuple derived from the downlink IP traffic. It associates that uplink rule with the DSCP received in corresponding downlink 5-tuple. Each uplink packet matching that uplink rule is marked with the associated DSCP.\nFor IP flows initiated from the UE, uplink packets will not be marked until a marked downlink packet is received with the downlink n-tuple that matches the received uplink n-tuple.\nSome clarifications to the function of reflective QoS in the UE (this describes only the logical function for the reflective QoS marking, the implementation might be differently):\n-\tFor each incoming downlink IP packet the UE checks if a DSCP marking rule for the n-tuple of this IP packet exists. If the rule does not exist, then a new marking rule is added. Otherwise, the DSCP value and the time stamp for this marking rule are set.\n-\tThe uplink n-tuple in each marking rule is made from the downlink n-tuple of that rule by swapping address (and port) destination and source.\n-\tFor each outgoing IP packet the UE checks if a marking rule for this IP packet exists. If the n-tuple of the packet matches the uplink n-tuple of a marking rule, then the DSCP value of the packet is set to the DSCP value of that marking rule. The time stamp for that rule is set.\n-\tFor tunnelled scenarios, the n-tuples correspond to the n-tuples of the inner header of the packet. In all scenarios, the DSCP value of the marking rule is the DSCP value of the outer header of the packet. This in both downlink and uplink direction.\n-\tA marking rule is removed when a certain period of time has passed since the time stamp.\n-\tThe function of reflective QoS will overwrite DSCP markings set by the UE application.\nThe Fixed Broadband Access implements bandwidth limitation on a per-line granularity. However, at this point in time, Fixed Broadband Access does not implement per-device bandwidth limitation in the RG. Therefore, the UE may take more uplink resources between RG and PDN GW then it was entitled to by S9a admission control (e.g. the UE might set the DSCP incorrectly). Fixed Broadband Access might implement a number of mechanisms to protect the Fixed Broadband Access network from a misbehaving UE :\n-\tThe RG might have pre-configured rules to allow only 3GPP UEs to set DSCP. Distinguishing 3GPP UE from other devices might for example be based on authentication (always EAP-AKA for 3GPP UEs) or from packet destination address (always ePDG/P-GW for S2b/S2c).\n-\tThe BNG may enforce UE bandwidth limitation based on the information (including QoS rules) received over S9a via the BPCF. These rules may have a different granularity as determined suitable for the Fixed Broadband Access network (e.g. in a scenario with user place confidentiality protection). The granularity may be on a per UE and DSCP or per UE and IP flow basis.\nFor the H(e)NB case, DSCP marking is performed by the H(e)NB according to the QoS information of the EPS bearer/PDP context. The H(e)NB shall copy the marking to the outer header. Based on H(e)NB configuration either the QCI mapping or the Reflective QoS may be used.\nThe RG and BNG located in between the H(e)NB and the SeGW/H(e)NB GW and between the UE and ePDG/PDN GW may perform QoS treatment and QoS remapping based on DSCP value of the outer IP header.\nFor the control plane in the H(e)NB case, the QoS associated with control plane traffic (e.g. H(e)NB management traffic, Iu/S1 messages) could be preconfigured in the H(e)NB for uplink. The H(e)NB marks the relevant message traffic with the appropriate DSCP according to the preconfigured QoS.

Instead, the Fixed Broadband Access Network may employ local policies.\nFor NS-WLAN offloaded traffic, the local IP session for the UE in Fixed Broadband Access is handled as an IP-CAN session by the PCRF. For EPC-routed traffic, the IP-CAN session for the PDN Connection in the PDN GW is created via Gx procedures. In addition, a Gateway Control Session is established between the BPCF and the PCRF corresponding to the EPC-routed IP-CAN session in the PCRF.\nThe Fixed Broadband Access domain has local policies that indicate as part of the inter-operator agreements, both if policy control for NSWO is provided and the NSWO-APN for subscribers for a given HPLMN.\nNOTE 3:\tDynamic provisioning from the HPLMN of either an indication of policy control for NS-WLAN traffic and what the NSWO-APN is for the subscriber of a certain PLMN is out of the scope of this Release.\n1.\tThe UE may perform the 3GPP based (EAP) access authentication procedure involving the Fixed Broadband Access network as specified in TS 23 402 [3] clause 7.2.1 step 1.

How this is done is out of 3GPP scope.\n4.\tWhen the BPCF receives the trigger and policy interworking with PCRF is supported, if local policies indicate that policy control for NS-WLAN offloaded traffic is provided for subscribers from that PLMN, the BPCF sends an indication of IP-CAN session establishment for NS-WLAN offloaded traffic  as specified in TS 23.203 [4]. The BPCF includes the IMSI, IP-CAN type, UE local IP address and the NSWO-APN in the message to the PCRF.

Step 7 is only applicable when S2b PMIPv6 is used.\n6.\tThe description of the PDN connection setup procedure is the same as for steps 2-9 in TS 23 402 [3], clause 7.2.1 or for steps A.1-E.1 in TS 23 402 [3] clause 7.2.4, with the following additions when S2b-GTP is used: The UE local IP address and optionally UDP source port number (if NAT is detected) are also included in the Create Session Request message. The UE local IP address and optionally UDP source port number (if NAT is detected) are forwarded to the PCRF in IP-CAN Session Establishment procedure, an indication to apply Reflective QoS is provided to the UE as part of the IKEv2 tunnel establishment.\n7.\tTriggered by the IKEv2 tunnel establishment in step 3 and by the indication that the UE is connected via a WLAN connected to fixed broadband access from 3GPP AAA, the ePDG initiates Gxb* session establishment with the PCRF by using Gateway Control Session establishment procedure as specified in TS 23.203 [4]. The ePDG includes the IMSI, APN, IP-CAN type, UE IP address allocated by EPC, the UE local IP address and optionally UDP source port number (if NAT is detected).\nNOTE 4:\tThe 3GPP AAA determines if the UE is connected via a WLAN connected to a fixed broadband access on UE Local IP address received in EAP-AKA signalling over SWm.\n8.\tThis step may be triggered by step 6 or step 7.\nWhen triggered by step 6, the PCRF (for non-roaming case), the V-PCRF (for visited access) or the H-PCRF (for home routed) initiates Gateway Control Session establishment with the BPCF. The V-PCRF (for home routed) proxies the Gateway Control Session Establishment request to the BPCF: IMSI and UE local IP address and port needs to be included in the Gateway Control Session Establishment request message.\nWhen triggered by step 7, the PCRF (for non-roaming case) and the V-PCRF (for home routed and visited access roaming case) initiates Gateway Control Session establishment request over S9a with the BPCF.
