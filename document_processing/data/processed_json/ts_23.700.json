      "content": "Providing access to local services refers to the capability to provide access to a hosting network and a set of services offered by the hosting network provider, and 3rd party service providers including other network operators and 3rd party application providers. The services may be localized (i.e. provided at specific/limited area) and may be bounded in time. The user may become aware of the available access to local services, and the process to gain and terminate access to the hosting network and local services. This process should be efficient, and convenient from a user experience standpoint.\nProviding access to local services creates new opportunities for users and service providers. For example, access can be provided in areas where there is no coverage provided by other networks (for example, on a cargo ship out at sea), or the access and local services can be established as needed (on a short-term basis), without the need for long term business relationships, permanently installed equipment, etc.\nThe type of local services and access for localized services via a hosting network can be promoted and arranged through different channels. Principally the Localized service provider (e.g. brick and mortar businesses, construction contractors, first responder agencies, etc.) will provide information and proper incentive or instructions to potential users so that they will seek to access the local services via hosting networks.\nThe 5G network as hosting network offering access to such localized services can be either a PNI-NPN or an SNPN.\nIt is assumed that hosting network and the localized services can be operated by different entities. Localized services may provide more than just data connectivity to end users, e.g. additional information/incentive/instructions in order to seek access to the localized services in.\nThis key issue aims at addressing how to enable a NPN (i.e. a SNPN or a PNI-NPN) as a hosting network for providing access to localized services with the following aspects:\n-\tDefine hosting NPN and identify the difference(s) between hosting NPN and NPN defined in both Rel-16 and Rel-17.\n-\tDefine localized services and identify the difference(s) between localized services and regular services.\n-\tDefine where and when localized services are available based on localized service agreements (i.e. a service agreement for a localized service).\nNOTE 1:\tSA WG2 works under the assumption that the relationships and the localized service agreements are already available by means outside SA WG2 scope i.e. SA WG2 is to agree where the information is made available.\n-\tWhat is required to enable communication between a network operator deploying a hosting network and a localized services provider:\n-\tInvestigate which type of interaction (e.g. configuration of the hosting network, information reporting) is needed, in such relation to enable the localized services provider for making the best use of the hosting network; and\nNOTE 2:\tCollaboration with SA WG5 and SA WG3 may be needed.",

The discovery mechanism can be based on provisioning the UE with appropriate information.

This information allows the UE to discover, select and access the hosting network offering the localized services.\n-\tReception and usage of configuration provided by a localized services provider to discover and access a hosting network and localized services is subject to home network operator's policy and agreement between a localized services provider and hosting network operator, including the considerations of prior service agreement with a localized services provider and no prior subscription to hosting network.\n-\tIf the UE is able to obtain services from two networks simultaneously, it may additionally select the hosting network.\n-\tThe selection of a hosting network can be done on request by the user, i.e. using manual selection, unless the UE can, maintain the PDU Sessions established with the home network and retain the services provided by the home network on these PDU Sessions, while selecting the hosting network (see KI#5).\n-\tAutomatic selection of a hosting network needs to be allowed by the home network of the subscription/credentials used by the UE.\n-\tA localized service agreement is established (see KI#3).\nThis key issue aims at addressing the following aspects:\n-\tInvestigate which type of information needs to be exchanged between hosting network and a localized services provider so that a UE can perform discovery, selection and connection of the hosting network and access the localized services provided via the hosting network.\nNOTE 1:\tThe hosting network can also act as a service provider for localized services.\n-\tWhat is the provisioning mechanism and the information needed for the UE to discover, select and access suitable hosting network for localized services with possible validity conditions for accessing the hosting network offering the localized services, because of the nature of the localized service and hosting network (e.g. time and location constrains).

      "content": "SNPN selection for localized services is performed by a UE that supports access to localized services in SNPNs and that has been configured to access localized services in SNPNs. We will call this UE an \"SNPN-localized services-enabled UE\".\nAn \"SNPN-localized services-enabled UE\" can be configured with a specific prioritized list of SNPNs for localized services. The UE can be pre-configured or dynamically configured by the subscribed SNPN or Home PLMN (e.g. using the SoR procedure as defined in Annex C of TS 23.122 [6]). The dynamically configured mechanism by the subscribed SNPN or Home PLMN (e.g. using the SoR procedure as defined in Annex C of TS 23.122 [6]) is not used to steer the UE from one hosting network to another hosting network. If the UE which is registered to a hosting network received the updated prioritized list of SNPNs for localized services, then the UE only uses the updated prioritized list of SNPNs for localized services to perform SNPN hosting network selection for localized services after the UE leaves the current hosting network for localized services.\nNOTE:\tIt assumes that how does the subscribed SNPN or Home PLMN construct the prioritized list of SNPNs for localized services is addressed by other solutions.\nThe reason to have a separate list for localised services instead of a common one like the one is defined in clause 5.30.2.4 of TS 23.501 [3] is that there may be a case where the home SNPN or HPLMN or the UE is present in the same areas where localised services are provided and based on the existing selection procedures the UE will always prefer the home SNPN or HPLMN in this case.\nThe prioritized list of SNPNs for localized services is stored in the context of a given subscription in the UE. If the UE has multiple subscriptions, then the UE may have one prioritized list of SNPNs for localized services for each subscription.\nEach entry in the prioritized list of SNPNs for localized services contains:\n1.\tAn identification of the SNPN and the localized service to access. This identification can be done in a few different ways:\n-\tIdentification Mode 1: SNPN ID (PLMN ID + NID) or a Group ID for Network Selection (GIN)\n-\tThis mode if identification assumes that the localized service is enabled in the whole SNPN with the SNPN ID or in every cell where GIN is broadcasted.\n-\tNote that an SNPN operator could potentially use multiple SNPN IDs in different areas.\n-\tIdentification Mode 2: SNPN ID or GIN, plus an additional Subnetwork ID.\n-\tThe subnetwork ID is used to assign a specific area where the localized service is provided, and it is broadcasted in SIB together with SNPN ID or GIN.\n-\tThe subnetwork ID may be a new ID or may be CAG (effectively extending CAG use to SNPN).\nNOTE:\tWhether to reuse CAG for subnetwork in SNPN or define a new ID is to be evaluated during evaluation/conclusions.\n-\tOne or more localized services may be assigned the same subnetwork ID if they are offered in the same area.\n2.\tValidity information:\n-\tValidity time period.\n-\tAdditional location information (TAI list or geographical information).\nThe UE uses this prioritized list and the validity information to perform discovery and selection and to leave the SNPN as described in the Procedures clause 6.10.3.",

The CAG cell(s) are inherently associated with location or spatial validity condition(s) and hence additional spatial validity condition is not required to be provided with Allowed CAG list.\nHosting network specific aspects can be addressed as additional considerations, if needed, for NPN as a network slice of a PLMN described in TS 23.501 [3] Annex D.2.

assigned by the localized service, the service credentials can be used to authenticate and authorize the UE access to the localized service.\n-\tThe localized service provider acting as the application function, updates subscription data in the subscribed Home Network or Credentials Holder or Hosting network via network exposure, so the subscription data can contain the localized service information subscribed by a single UE or a group of UEs:\nEditor's note:\tIt is FFS how network exposure is used by localized service provider to update the subscription data and what the subscription data for localized service contains.\n-\tIf the UE will access the Hosting Network using credential from Credentials Holder with AAA Server, then the localized service provider updates the subscription data in the subscribed Hosting Network, so the subscription data contains the indication that primary AA by AAA-S is required as well as the subscribed localized service information e.g. subscribed DNN, S-NSSAI, QoS, service authorization method, service access method, time and location.\n-\tIf the UE will access the Hosting Network using credential from Credentials Holder with AUSF and UDM, then the localized service provider updates the subscription data in the subscribed Home Network, so the subscription data contains the subscribed Hosting Network information as well as the subscribed localized service information e.g. subscribed DNN, S-NSSAI, QoS, service authorization method, service access method, time and location.\n-\tIf the UE will access the Hosting Network using credentials from Home Network, then the localized service provider updates the subscription data in the subscribed Home Network, so the subscription data contains the subscribed Hosting Network information as well as the subscribed localized service information e.g. subscribed DNN, S-NSSAI, QoS, service authorization method, service access method, time and location.\n-\tThe Home Network updates UE with the network selection information for the subscribed Hosting Network (e.g. service identification, Hosting Network ID, temporal validity condition, spatial validity condition) when subscribed time starts and/or when UE enters specific area indicated by the subscribed location contained in the subscription data:\n-\tThe temporal validity condition is derived from the subscribed time for the localized service, this indicates the time period when the network selection information is valid.\n-\tThe spatial validity condition is derived from the subscribed location for the localized service, this indicates the area where the network selection information is valid.\n-\tThe Home Network can also provide UE with its N3IWF address to enable UE to access both home network services and localized services via the hosting network:\n-\tThe N3IWF address of home network is used for UE to determine its way to access to hosting network based on its radio-capability.(e.g. access hosting network directly, or access home network via hosting network as an underlay network).\n-\tThe UE moves in the subscribed location for the localized service and the temporal validity condition is still valid, and starts discovery and selection of the Hosting Network.\n-\tThe UE registers in the Hosting Network with the access credentials and accesses to the localized services using the service credentials.\n-\tThe UE is authenticated and authorized by the Home Network or the Credentials Holder.\n-\tThe UE can be provisioned with information related with the subscribed localized service (Allowed NSSAI, service authorization method, URSP rules).\n-\tThe UE setups the connectivity to the localized service by establishing a PDU Session with the DNN, S-NSSAI associated with the localized service, the Hosting Network can allocate resources for the PDU Session according to the subscribed QoS or service access method.\n-\tWith the subscribed service authorization method, the Hosting Network performs the service authorization using the indicated authorization method.\n-\tWith the subscribed time and location, the Hosting Network performs access control to the localized service.\n-\tWhen the UE moves out the subscribed location for the localized service or the temporal validity condition becomes out-dated:\n-\tThe UE de-registers from the Hosting Network, the UE may delete the network selection information for the subscribed Hosting Network and information related with the subscribed localized service.\n-\tThe Hosting Network de-registers the UE and releases network resources reserved for the UE.\n-\tThe localized service provider may delete the localized service information from subscription data in the Home Network or Credentials Holder or Hosting network.\nFigure 6.13.2-1 depicts the scenarios for support of providing access to localized services.\nFigure 6.13.2-1: Support of providing access to localized services via exposure enhancements\n-\tWhen UE returns to Home Network from the Hosting Network, the AMF of Hosting Network may group the UEs based on the Nwu status and the availability of the Home Network of the UE. Hosting Network indicates the UE with a random back-off timer from different range of values corresponding to different groups to register to Home Network.\n-\tAMF of hosting network indicates UE the localized service(s) end. One or more localized services ID may be included in this indication.\n-\tUpon receiving the end indication of the localized service(s) from the AMF, UE may:\n-\tdetermine whether all the target localized services provided by the hosting network end.\n-\tdetermine its current Nwu interface status for the specific home network.\n-\tdetect whether there is a coverage of the specific home network in a good signal condition(e.g. meet the requirement of the signal strength to access to)\n-\tIf UE determines all the target localized services provided by the hosting network end, UE reports the Nwu interface status and related home network identity(e.g. PLMN ID) that the Nwu interface connects to. UE reports the availability of the coverage of the home network.\n-\tBased on the reports of the UEs, AMF groups the UE and indicate the UE with a random back-off timer from different range of values corresponding to different groups to register to home network in different groups.\nFor every single home network, AMF may group the UEs into four groups:\n-\tGroup1: Nwu interface for home network exists and coverage of the home network exists. AMF may assign a random back-off timer value from a pre-defined range for each UE in order to trigger the UE to start to register and establish the PDU session in the home network immediately.\n-\tGroup2: Nwu interface for home network does not exist and coverage of the home network exists. AMF may assign a random back-off timer value from a pre-defined range for each UE in order to trigger the UE to start to register to the home network immediately. The pre-defined range of back-off timer in Group2 should be longer than which of in Group1.\n-\tGroup3: Nwu interface for home network exists and coverage of the home network does not exist. AMF may assign a random back-off timer value from a pre-defined range for each UE in order to trigger the UE to start to register and establish the PDU session in the home network when UE detects the availability of the home network. The pre-defined range of back-off timer in Group3 should be longer than which of in Group2.\n-\tGroup4: Nwu interface for home network does not exist and coverage of the home network does not exist. AMF may assign a random back-off timer value from a pre-defined range for each UE in order to trigger the UE to start to register to home network when UE detects the availability of the home network. The pre-defined range of back-off timer in Group4 should be longer than which of in Group3.\nFigure 6.13.2-2 depicts an example to group the UEs by AMF based on the reports of the UEs.\nFigure 6.13.2-2: AMF groups the UEs based on the reports of the Nwu status and the availability of the Home Network of the UE\n-\tUE should wait until the expiry of the back-off timer to initiate the registration attempt and PDU session establishment request attempt to the home network if needed.",

This is achieved for example through connection to N3WIF in the case of untrusted non-3GPP access architecture or for Trusted Non-3GPP access using the network elements of TNAP and TNGF.\nThese assumptions may though not hold true in \"enterprise\" environment that will possibly deploy 3GPP based \"private cellular network\"/SNPN while it already has a deployed WLAN infrastructure in place. For example in such enterprise environment the identities and credentials used for WLAN authentication could be already provisioned to the \"enterprise\" UEs before the SNPN is deployed. In such network environment also access to specific services can be restricted through using a VPN that runs on top of internet connection provided from WLAN or using application layer authentication and therefore there is possibly no need to have N3IWF in the \"untrusted non-3GPP access\" architecture and there is no need to upgrade the existing WLAN infrastructure to support what is required from TNAP and TGNF in the \"trusted non-3GPP access\" architecture.\nThe other two aspects that need consideration is the access network selection and mobility. For access network selection mechanisms standardised by 3GPP e.g. using ANDSP need to be enhanced for Non-Seamless WLAN Offload or rely on local UE configuration. Seamless mobility is not in scope of this solution since many applications can also work with nomadic mobility.\nThe solution describes how UE can access an SNPN with NG-RAN on one hand and a WLAN Access Network on the other hand using the same credentials. If the credentials use AKA and USIM authentication and are stored in UDM, the existing mechanisms for Non-Seamless WLAN Offload defined in TS 33.501 [10] and TS 23.501 [3] apply.\nIf the credentials are stored in a AAA Server possibly new authentication procedures and Non-Seamless WLAN Offload (NSWO) architecture need to be defined. After being authenticated the UE does not have access to 5GC via WLAN and it performs only Non-seamless WLAN offload traffic.\nIn summary this solution proposes the following enhancements:\n(1)\tin the case of SNPN with non-3GPP credentials there has to be an association between the WiFi and cellular (non-3GPP) credentials that are stored in the cellular modem; and\n(2)\tWLANSPs support for SNPN ID, GIN to identify WLAN AN associated with the SNPN.\nThe details are described in the following clauses.",

The same principle applies if home network is SNPN.\n0.\tThe UE is already registered via an AMF in a VPLMN or in the HPLMN. This implies that the AMF has already registered in UDM, has obtained subscription data for the UE and subscribed to subscription data updates including possible updates of SOR information.\n1.\tThe UE requests an authorization of TNR procedure by including a TNR information within a NAS message, e.g. a Registration Request. The TNR information can be sent as a separate IE or in a new transparent container for the HPLMN UDM (i.e. all AMFs would simply forward the transparent container).\nNOTE:\tWhether and how the TNR information is protected by UE before sending to AMF is up to SA WG3.\nThe TNR information in the UE request includes, e.g.:\ni.\tRequested start and stop time for permission to use TNR procedure.\nii.\tThe selected localized service identity.\niii.\tThe selected hosting network identity.\n2.\tBased on the TNR information received from the UE, the AMF decides to update its registration in UDM to provide the UE requested TNR information to UDM.\n3.\tBased on the TNR information received from the AMF, the UDM decides to request the SOR-AF for authorizing the TNR requested by the UE (step 3a and 3b). The UDM does this even if the UE is registered in the HPLMN.\nThe SOR-AF updates the SOR information for the UE if needed according to SOR-AF decision (step 3c) and protects the SOR info via AUSF (step 3d). The SOR information provided by the SOR-AF includes the TNR authorization in the SOR-AF. This can be in the form of, e.g.\ni.\tAn indication that the UE is authorized for TNR. Based on this indication, UE can temporarily suspend the automatic network selection mechanism which is according to the available SOR list stored in the UE, or temporarily switch SNPN access mode.\nii.\tAn updated or new list of prioritized PLMNs or SNPNs including the hosting network selected by the UE with the highest priority.\niii.\tConditions for UE to activate TNR, e.g. authorized start/stop time, location, indication of whether possible to access home network using N3IWF via the hosting network, indication of home routed architecture exists between home network and the hosting network, etc.\nUE determines whether automatic network selection is possible, based on the indications described above and the UE's own capabilities (e.g. dual radio capability, access home network using N3IWF via hosting network).\nIn order to avoid overload of the home network when UE leaves the hosting network(Key Issue #6), the UDM/SOR-AF can apply an offset to the authorized star/stop time in the authorized TNR sent to UE.\n4.\tThe UDM provides the authorization decision to the UE via the AMF after protection via AUSF.\n6-10.\tAs defined in clause C.2 of TS 23.122 [6].\n11.\tThe UE applies the TNR as authorized by the SOR-AF when conditions are met.

      "content": "This solution proposes to allow UE to use registration procedure to query the localized service information from the AMF of the hosting network. The local hosting network may configure a designated AMF to handle the UE access for localized service and store the localized service information. The localized service information stored in the designated AMF can be configured locally or provisioned by the localized service provider's AF via NEF. A new localized service intention indicator or new Registration Type is carried in the registration request message sent by UE to the AMF, to indicates UE's intention of using the registration for the query of localized service information. The gNB of the hosting network can use this indicator to select the designated AMF and forward the registration to this AMF, if there is a designated AMF for localized services. Upon receiving this indication, the designated AMF can provide UE with the localized service information during or after the registration procedure by using the Registration Accept message or Configuration Update Command. The UE may not have the right subscription which allows UE to access the hosting network before UE queries the localized service information, e.g. the user may not buy a ticket which has the credentials information, therefore, UE may only use the registration procedure to query the localized service information instead of registering to the network. For the latter case, network will send registration reject to the UE but with cause value of localized information query response along with the localized service information shown to the user. And UE may use the queried localized service information to subscribe the localized services (e.g. User uses the service portal address to subscribe the services) and manually select the hosting network later.\nThere can be some different registration intention indicators or registration type which can be carried in the registration request:\n-\tLocal service information Query only: This indicates the UE only uses this registration request to query localized service information without actual camping and registering to the network. After the hosting network gNB receives the registration request message with this indicator, the gNB forwards the request message to the AMF which can provide the information, such as the designated AMF. The AMF skips the normal registration procedure and just responses UE with registration reject but with cause value of localized information query response along with the localized service information. In this case, if UE is still connected and registered with the home network, UE can be either manually initiated by user to deregister from the home network and conduct query with the hosting network, or UE conducts the localized service information query while UE enters the RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE state based on a stored localized service discovery policy which contains conditions under which service discovery with other hosting network(s) can be conducted. UE and the home network can use paging restriction as defined in clause 5.38.5 of TS 23.501 [3] while UE is conducting localized service query with the hosting network RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE state.\n-\tRegistration with local service information query: This indicates that the UE would like to collect local service information during service registration phase. After the hosting network gNB receives the registration request message with this indicator, the network forwards the request message to the AMF which can provide information, such as the designated AMF. The AMF can provide the localized service information by either adding the localized service information in the registration accept message or sending separate NAS message, such as UCU.\n-\tRegistration only: This indicates that the UE only wants to conduct normal service registration without collecting the localized service information. When the local service intention indicator is absent in the registration request message, it's default to consider the intention indicator is registration only, in order to support backword compatibility or the network which doesn't support localized services.\nIn addition, the AMF will indicate how the localized services can be accessed by either providing a specific slice and/or a PDU session The AMF may also provide the UE a list of Tracking Areas, e.g. called \"Localized Services availability area\", where the localized services are available. The UE will then use this information instead of periodical searches to discover localized services.\nIf a certain localized service was not available when the UE asked for it during the registration and now has become available, the network can page the UE (if it happens to be in IDLE Mode), bring it to Connected Mode and then provide the needed information by means of UCU procedure.\nIn order to enable UE to use registration message to query localized service information, the hosting network needs to broadcast its capability of supporting the localized service access (e.g. using SIB message). UE only send register request with localized service query to the hosting network which supports localized service access.\nIf UE is connected to the home network and supported by the home network, UE can conduct localized service information query with the hosting network including receiving the SIB messages from the hosting network while UE is in the RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE state. UE and the home network can use paging restriction as defined in clause 5.38.5 of TS 23.501 [3] while UE is conducting localized service query with the hosting network.\nUE can initiate localized service query procedure either manually by the user or being trigged by a stored localized service discovery policy which contains conditions under which service discovery with other hosting network(s) can be conducted, such as time, Localized Services availability area, as well as allowed discovery window duration (this can be used to configure the paging restriction information) while UE is in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE state. This policy can be provisioned by the home network, or localized service providers or User. The home network can also trigger UE to conduct the localized service discovery procedure while UE enters RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE state and certain conditions are met, such as time, Localized Services availability area, so on. In order to trigger UE to conduct localized service discovery, the home network includes a localized service discovery indication and a discovery window which the page restriction is applied in the AN release message sending to UE.",

It is proposed that the Hosting network supporting Localized service(s) broadcasts information indicating the supported Localized service(s). The broadcast information can be transmitted from NG-RAN or non-3GPP access network of the Hosting networks.\nFollowing are the characteristics of the solution:\n1.\tThe UE is configured with Localized service information which includes the Localized service identification (e.g. Localized service ID) and information when and where a Localized service is available (i.e. availability conditions like time period and location). This configuration may be provided to the UE from the application layer (e.g. from Localized service provider, LSP):\na.\tThe LSP may have a service level agreement with Hosting network(s). During the SLA establishment the LSP and the Hosting network has agreed the Localized service ID and the service availability conditions (like time period and location), which the LSP can provide to the UE via the application layer. The LSP would act as CH when the UE accesses the Hosting network.\nb.\tIn one alternative, it is possible that the Home network configures the UE with the Localized service ID and service availability conditions. Here the Home network and the Hosting network should have established SLAs. The Home network would act as CH when the UE accesses the Hosting network.\n2.-\tThe UE NAS layer requests the AS layer to discover available Hosting networks which broadcast support of the Localized service ID and the availability conditions are fulfilled.\n2a.\tThe broadcast information (e.g. the SIB of NG-RAN) from the access network includes at least the following parameters: (1) a Hosting NW indication which indicates that the network supports any Localized service; and (2) Localized service identifier and/or (3) Human Readable Service Name (HRSN) identifying the Localized service.\nEditor's note:\tWhether broadcasting the above parameters has potential security and privacy issues is FFS and the security impacts shall be evaluated by SA WG3.\nNOTE:\tThe above broadcast information may take local regulations into account.\n3.\tThe UE AS layer creates a list of discovered Hosting networks fulfilling the availability conditions; and reports to the NAS layer the list of discovered Hosting networks. If there are more than one discovered Hosting network broadcasting the Localized service ID, the AS layer may order the Hosting networks, e.g. by using the signal strength.\n4.\tThe UE selects a Hosting network from the list of discovered Hosting networks.

This option fully relies on UE to make decision on whether the conditions are met and when to move to the local network after receiving the instruction from the home network, while the home network may lack knowledge of the UE's location and the coverage from the target hosting network in UE's location when the home makes steering decision.\nOption 2:\tNetwork-and-UE-coordination based: Home network coordinates with UE to obtain UE location and the reception performance of the target hosting network in UE's location, before the home network makes steering decision to instruct UE to steer to the target hosting network.",

UE will only select and access the hosting network which meets those defined conditions.\nFor option 2 (Network-and-UE-coordination based), for the home network to precisely steer the UE to the suitable hosting network based on UE's present location to avoid steering UE to a network which UE can't receive good coverage in that location, the home network may want to have the latest network performance status of the potential candidate hosting network in that area. Knowing the potential target network coverage for the UE(s) to be steered to may not be the reason for steering, instead it's used by the home network to check if the target network(s) are suitable for the UE with good coverage.\nThere are 2 methods for option 2:\n-\tMethod 1: The home network can use that UE location information to query the network performance information (e.g. performance analytics or Observed service experiences related network data analytics) from the target hosting SNPN in that UE location via target hosting SNPN's NEF. Based on the information from target network hosting SNPN, the home network decides if the hosting network is suitable for UE to be steered to or not. This method is from the network point of view with data being collected from the target network to determinate and predict if UE is in the good service coverage of target network or not. This method may not reflect the real UE experience in that location.\n-\tMethod 2: The home network can instruct UE to measure and report the signal reception status of the potential target hosting network(s). This can be realized via enhancing the UCU or UPU procedures. The signal reception status information from UE can be simple indication if those candidate network's signal strength is below or pass a defined signal strength threshold defined in UE's policy or the report instruction from home network, without requiring to UE to report detail information of the target network.",

It tries to solve the case of how to access Localized services when UE has neither any prior subscription with Hosting network nor with the Localised service provider (clause 5.7 of TR 22.844 [12]). The solution thus proposes how Hosting network can perform \"on boarding\" of UE for a particular localised service.\nIt also provides ideas for Key Issue#3, focusing on what kind of information needs to be exchanged between Localized service provider and the Hosting network.\nThe solution proposes to provision the credential to the UE via a restricted PDU Session. User may choose a particular Localized service based on information displayed on its mobile phone, and based on the chosen service and local configurations, AMF and SMF may create a session for the UE via which UE can connect to a captive portal pay for the services and then be provisioned the required credentials for accessing the Hosting network.\nDuring the service agreement between Localised service provider and the Hosting network, details of captive portal may be provided by the Localised service provider to the Hosting network.\nIf the Hosting network is able to authenticate UE using its Home Network credentials, even then UE may require new credentials for accessing localised services (because UE's current subscription does not include Localised services usage).\nIf the Hosting network is not able to authenticate the UE using its Home network credentials, then provisioning can be RLOS based.",

Based on the agreement, the hosting networks identities, locations, and the localized services information are shared with the home network.\n2a.\tUE initiates registration with the hosting network for accessing the localized service.\nNOTE 1:\tTo identify the home network AMF of UEs, UEs share their home network given 5G-GUTI value while registering to the hosting network. In the case of roaming, UEs share 5G-GUTI of serving network that served last. Editor's note:\tIt is FFS that how UE deregistered from hosting network would select the same serving network that served last in roaming scenarios.\n2b.\tThe hosting network AMF accepts the registration of UE.\n3a.\tThe hosting network subscribes for configuration service for deregistering UEs to the home network in an adaptive manner. The subscription request includes the hosting network ID, the localized service information, and the number of UEs registered for the localized service.\nNOTE 2:\tThe interface between hosting network AMF and home network AMF can be direct or indirect. It is assumed that there is a bidirectional communication between hosting network AMF and home network AMF.\n3b.\tUpon receiving the subscription request from the hosting network, the home network AMF determines the hosting network and the localized service specific maximum allowed number of returning UEs to the home network per unit time, which is used for simultaneous deregistration at the hosting network.\nBased on the given number of UEs registered for the localized service in the hosting network, the localized service end time, and the number of UEs that can attempt to register from the home network and other hosting networks, the home network AMF determines the hosting network and the localized service specific the allowed maximum number of returning UEs per unit time to the home network. The home network AMF ensures that the total number of UEs attempting to register at a time from the home network and hosting networks do not exceed the maximum number of UEs that can be handled based on its processing capability in order to avoid congestion and overloading.\n3c.\tThe home network AMF notifies to the hosting network the allowed maximum number of returning UEs to the home network AMF per unit time. The notification includes the hosting network ID, the allowed maximum number of returning UEs per unit time, valid time to follow this instruction, and the localized service information that UEs are accessing.\nIf there is a change in the allowed maximum number of returning UEs from the hosting network to the home network AMF per unit time due to increase or decrease in the number of UEs that can attempt to register from the home network and other hosting networks, then the home network AMF notifies the new value (the updated allowed maximum number of returning UEs) to the hosting network in a new notification. In this case, the hosting network follows the instruction in the new notification and discards the old notification, i.e. the new notification always has higher precedence than the old notification.\n4.\tThe temporary localized service time is over at the hosting network.\n5a.\tUDM coordinates with AMFs for selection of the allowed maximum number of returning UEs from hosting network based on the notification from the home network AMF. The selection is for simultaneous deregistration of UEs in an adaptive manner based on the notification from the home network AMF and ensures that the number of returning UEs from the hosting network do not exceed the maximum number of UEs the home network AMF can handle.\nThere is a possibility that multiple AMFs in home network handle registration requests of UEs returning from hosting network and each home network AMF notified the allowed maximum number of returning UEs can be considered based on step 3 in that case.\nNOTE 3:\tThe notified value of the allowed maximum number of returning UEs to the home network is valid until the valid time is expired.\n5b.\tThe hosting network AMF initiates the simultaneous deregistration by sending Deregistration Request messages to the selected number of UEs in step 5a.\nNOTE 4:\tUEs may initiate deregistration procedure before the localized service is terminated. The hosting network AMF can handle UE-initiated deregistration requests as well. In order to allow the hosting network AMF to select the allowed maximum number of returning UEs to the home network, the service termination time of UEs can be set to slightly higher than the actual localized service termination time.\n5c.\tUEs deregister from the hosting network and the AMF accepts the deregistration.\nIf UEs initiate Deregistration Request and the number UEs initiate the Deregistration Request procedure is higher than the allowed maximum number of returning UEs to the home network per unit time, then the hosting network AMF indicates the event with 'the allowed maximum number of returning UEs exceeded' parameter in a Deregistration Response message to that home network UEs. After deregistering from the hosting network, UEs which exceeded the allowed maximum number of returning UEs to that home network wait for a random amount of time before registering back to the home network or another hosting network. Otherwise, UEs initiate the registration procedure to their home network or another hosting network immediately after leaving the hosting network.\nNOTE 5:\tAfter deregistration, UEs place the hosting network NPN in a temporary forbidden list (a list of PLMN ID or SNPN ID which prohibits the UE to select the PLMN ID or SNPN IDs in this list for a certain period of time) and initiates automatic PLMN/SNPN network selection mode.\n6.\tDeregistered UEs leave the hosting network and initiate registration procedure to their home network or another hosting network.\n7.\tOnce all UEs registered for the localized service are deregistered, the hosting network unsubscribes the configuration service from the home network.

The UE is configured with one or more prioritized SNPN/GIN lists as defined in clause 5.30.2.3 of TS 23.501 [3].\nFor support of Emergency services the non-3GPP access network advertises the support of Emergency service (e.g. via ANQP).\nFor support of UE onboarding the non-3GPP access network advertises the Onboarding enabled indication (e.g. via ANQP).\nThe solution has UE impact, non-3GPP access network impact (additional parameters in ANQP messages) and TNGF impact (inclusion of \"selected NID\" in the [NGAP] INITIAL UE MESSAGE, which is up to RAN3 to define).\nThe solution has TS 23.402 [9] impacts if UE constructs a prioritized list of WLAN access networks by using the WLAN Selection Policy (WLANSP) rules from ANSDP (currently supported only for PLMN in TS 23.402 [9]). Alternatively, the solution can rely on local configuration in the UE.\nSolution #4\nSupport of onboarding over untrusted non-3GPP access in SNPN\nThis solution builds on top of Solution #2 and aims to add support for the following scenarios:\n-\taccess to PVS is restricted inside the ON-SNPN and the PVS is not accessible from the public internet directly over the \"untrusted non-3GPP access network\".\n-\tUE accesses to SNPN via indirect non-3GPP access or direct non-3GPP access for Onboarding.\nThe additional UE impact (compared to Solution #2) includes the ability to construct a GIN-based FQDN for selection of the N3IWF/SNPN that will be used for UE onboarding, as well as inclusion of Onboarding indication in the AN parameter sent to the N3IWF during registration procedure.\nThe solution has several unresolved Editor's notes.\nSolution #5\nSupport of Credentials Holder scenarios over untrusted non-3GPP access in SNPN\nThis solution builds on top of Solution #2 and aims to add support for accessing SNPN using credentials owned by Credentials Holder separate from the SNPN.\nThe additional UE impact (compared to Solution #2) includes the ability to construct a GIN-based FQDN for selection of the N3IWF/SNPN where UE accesses by using credentials owned by the Credentials Holder belonging to a group identified by the GIN.\nThe solution has several unresolved Editor's notes.\nSolution #6\nAccess to SNPN services via wireline access network\nThe solution defines how the 5G-RG, FN-RG, and devices behind the RG (UE or N5GC devices behind an FN-RG or 5G-RG) can access SNPN services via a wireline access network. It is based on clause 4.2.1 of TS 23.316, where the SNPN is implicitly selected by wired physical connectivity between 5G-RG or FN-RG and W-AGF. The only additional requirement is that the NID is included as part of the registration procedure for wireline access system.\nThe solution has 5G-RG and W-AGF impact (ability to formulate the SUCI that includes the SUPI type as \"IMSI\" and the home network domain which includes a NID in addition to PLMN ID).\nSolution #16\nAccess to SNPN with NG-RAN and to WLAN Access Network using the same credentials\nThe solution describes how UE can access an SNPN with NG-RAN on one hand and a WLAN Access Network on the other hand using the same credentials. UE uses the same permanent identity (SUCI) and credentials for primary authentication in SNPN and for WLAN access authentication in a WLAN Access Network.\nFor access network selection the solution assumes that either mechanisms standardised by 3GPP (e.g. using ANDSP) need to be enhanced for Non-Seamless WLAN Offload or rely on local UE configuration.\nSeamless mobility is not in scope of this solution.\nThe solution has UE impacts. The solution has TS 23.402 [9] impacts if WLAN Selection Policy (WLANSP) rules from ANDSP are used for Non-Seamless WiFi Offload (currently supported only for PLMN in TS 23.402 [9]). Alternatively, the solution can rely on local configuration in the UE.\nThe solution requires new authentication procedure and needs to be evaluated by SA3.\nSolution #19\nAccess to SNPN services via Untrusted non-3GPP access network with underlay/overlay determination\nThis solution builds on top of Solution #2 and aims to add a new RAT Type to discriminate between direct access to SNPN services via N3GPP access (as in Solution #2) and indirect access to SNPN services via PLMN as defined in TS 23.501 [3] clause 5.30.2.8 and clause D.3. The RAT Type for these two cases would be set to \"Untrusted N3GPP\" or \"Untrusted Non-3GPP over underlay PLMN\", respectively.\nThe underlying assumption is that in some scenarios the access to the SNPN's 5GC may need to be restricted for one of the RAT Types, but not for the other.\nThe solution has UE, N3IWF and AMF impact related to the determination of the RAT Type.\nThe solution has an unresolved Editor's notes related to how the N3IWF determines the access network information.\nSolution #20\nAccess SNPN via 3GPP and N3GPP AN using same credentials and credential holder\nThe solution defines how the same credentials from a credential holder external to the SNPN can be leveraged for devices accessing SNPN via 3GPP and non-3GPP access network (both connected to 5GC).\nThe solution has no normative impacts beyond the impact of Solution #5 (support of Credentials Holder over untrusted non-3GPP access in SNPN) and Solution #3 (support of Credentials Holder over trusted non-3GPP access in SNPN).\nThe scenario of UE and N3GPP device connected to 5GC via 5G-RG/FN-RG, is FFS. This scenario shall take into account the conclusion of the FS_5WWC_Ph2 study on the support of the device behind an RG.\nSolution #21\nSupport for NSWOF in SNPN\nThe solution proposes to extend the NSWO authentication so that UE can access a non-3GPP network (e.g. WLAN or Wireline access network) using the same permanent identity and credentials as for primary authentication in SNPN via NG-RAN and 5GC.\nThe solution has UE and 5G-RG impacts for support of NSWO authentication using SNPN credentials i.e. credentials with user identity whose \"realm\" part enables routing of SWa requests from the WLAN AN to the NSWO in the SNPN's 5GC (applies both to SIM-based and non-SIM based credentials). The 5G-RG impacts have dependency on the FS_5WWC_Ph2 study (e.g. Solution #22 in TR 23.700-17 [18]).",

Hosting network broadcasts a dedicated Hosting networking service indication to show that this NPN can provide hosting networking for localized services.\n-\tIf there is some service agreement between hosting network and home network, the UE can be successfully authenticated by the hosting network by using credentials of home network\n-\tIf there is no service agreement between hosting network and home network, the hosting network performs authentication by using the UE's default credentials.\nThe localized services information are pre-configured in AMF of hosting network.\nNOTE:\tFurther impacts to address key issue#3 aspects are to be evaluated when additional details/clarifications are available.\nSolution#41\nProvisioning of Credentials via Hosting Network PDU Session\nThe solution mainly resolves how the Hosting network can perform “on boarding” of UE for a particular localized service. For KI#3, it only focuses on what kind of information needs to be exchanged between the Localized service provider and the Hosting network.\nLocalized service provider may provide captive portal information to hosting network during service agreement phase. How the localized service information is available to UE is assumed to be provided by others solutions. User may manually choose a particular hosting network. UE may include the selected localized service in the request. AMF responds the request which may include DNN, S-NSSAI, an indication to trigger PDU Session creation. A PDU Session could be established to connect UE and localized service provider. UE can get the credentials in the PDU Session.\nNOTE:\tThe security impacts shall be evaluated by SA WG3.",

After a UE selects and accesses into a hosting network, the UE would obtain Allowed S-NSSAI from the hosting network.

      "content": "UE can obtain the localized service information from application server, serving network, home network, or hosting network.\nUE fetches the information from an application server (Sol #14, #28, #31, #40).\n-\tWhen a full set of new subscription/credential is provided to UE via application server, this principle has less system impact on 5GS. But on the other hand, home network subscription/credential is utilized for the UE to establish PDU connection with the application server and the UE needs to handle co-existence of multiple subscriptions/credentials on device.\n-\tWhen the information includes a list of hosting networks and an indication that home network credential is to be used, there will be impact on network selection. Application server obtaining such information via network exposure is not necessary, since it is covered as part of the SLA between localized service provider and hosting network operator.\nUE fetches the information from home network (Sol #10, #13, #14, #15, #18, #23, #24, #29, #30, #31, #33, #36, #43).\n-\tThis principle assumes that home network is capable of managing the localized service information data.\n-\tThe impact is about how home network is provisioned with the localized service information data, and how UE is provisioned by the home network.\n-\tMost of the solutions following this principle propose that the home network provides the localized service information to UE via SoR procedure in combination with the principle that the localized service information is constructed based on a priority list for (hosting) network selection as described in clause 7.4.2.\n-\tSome solutions assumed that the SoR-AF within the home network should be involved as the data source and the mechanism regarding how SoR-AF obtains such data should be out of 3GPP scope. Some solutions (Sol #14, #43) assumed the data source for SoR procedure is obtained from other NFs than SoR-AF.\nNOTE 1:\tIn the current specifications, SoR-AF is the only entity that creates the SoR message if there is a need to dynamically change the content of the SoR information.\n-\tSince SoR procedure is mainly used for network discovery and selection, it is not suitable to be extended to provision UE with data more than required for the UE's actual network discovery and selection.\nNOTE 2:\tThe current specifications provide the means for the serving network to provision the UE with information relevant for the serving network once the UE has registered to the hosting network e.g. network slicing information.\n-\tSol #24 proposes another variant for UE to fetch the information from home network, that is via home network UDR and new UE policy. UE policy has the potential to include necessary data of the localized service, and possibility to be extended in the future. The new UE policy can be delivered to UE by PCF in home network, or PCF in serving network using N24.\nUE fetches the information from serving network (Sol #11, #12, #24, #27, #32, #42, #44).\n-\tThis principle assumes serving network (either home network or another network which UE is accessing using home network credential) is capable of storing the localized service information data. This principle enables multiple information sources for UE to obtain localized service information.\n-\tIf the current serving network is not the home network, this principle also provides mechanisms for home network to authorize or determine the final data that UE will receive, where the serving network either checks a subscription flag (Sol #12, #24, #32) or passes the localized service data to home network for authorization and delivery to UE (Sol #12, #42).\n-\tThe impact is about how serving network is provisioned with the localized service information data, and how UE is provisioned by the serving network.\n-\tSome solutions following this principle proposes to use AMF/SMF in serving network to store the localized service information data. In this case, the provisioning to serving network is based on configuration which has less impact, but it requires the UE is served by the correct AMF/SMF configured with such information (e.g. UE is located in the overlapping area where the hosting network is available) or requires all the AMF/SMF in the serving network are configured with such information. The data is provisioned to UE via MM NAS or SM NAS message (it is TBD which procedures/messages are impacted).\n-\tOther solutions following this principle, proposes to use UDR in the serving network to store the localized service information data as application data for any UE registered to the serving network. This enables the flexibility that if the serving network is not the home network, UE can obtain localized service information data from either the serving network, or from the home network, or from both. The impact is to extend service specific parameter provisioning for the serving network to receive the data (see clause 4.15.6.7 of TS 23.502 [4]) and new UE policy to provide the data to the UE.\nUE fetches the information from hosting network (Sol #22, #26, #34, #41).\n-\tThis principle assumes a hosting network is selected prior to a localized service is selected, since the localized services information arrives later from the hosting network. It can happen that the fetched information is not interesting for the end user.\n-\tThe impact is to extend broadcast with capability for localized service, service discover policy that allows UE to query information from hosting network while in RRC-IDLE/INACTIVE with serving network, new on-demand SIB, or code for URL. Another impact is to deliver localized service information via registration reject/accept message.\nNOTE:\tPrivacy aspect needs to be evaluated by SA WG3.\n-\tThis principle implies that in some scenarios the UE needs to suspend the connection with or suppress the paging from the serving network when getting information from hosting network, which can cause service interruption.\nThere are different triggers to provision the information to UE:\n-\tUE request as trigger (Sol #11, #13, #15, #24, #27, #32, #34, #42).\n-\tUE location as trigger (Sol #11, #12, #18, #27, #32).\n-\tUE subscription data change via external parameter provisioning as trigger (Sol #14, #23, #43).\n-\tUE Steering of Roaming information update (SoR based solutions).\nUE request as trigger assumes UE/end user is aware of the desired localized services. UE location as trigger requires the serving network is aware of which hosting network is available in which serving network tracking areas, and the information sent to UE is unsolicited. UE subscription data change and SoR based solutions restrict the information source to home network only.\nThere are different architectures/business relationships between home network and hosting network or Localized service provider.\n-\tBusiness relationship / roaming interface exists between home network and hosting network or Localized service provider.\n-\tIn this scenario, the home network knows about the hosting network or the Localized services. Therefore, it is reasonable for the home network to provision obtain hosting network information/localized service information to the UE.\n-\tMoreover, UE can use its home network credentials to access hosting network.\n-\tTo allow flexible deployment and use of Localized service, it would be benefit to allow update the above information to the UE timely, after the UE requesting for the Localized service. The UE can request via OTT, then LSP can notify the home network of the UE to send the above information to the UE.\n-\tNo business relationship / roaming interface between home network and hosting network.\nIn this scenario, the home network does not know about the hosting network or the Localized services directly. There are two sub-scenarios regarding the business relationship between visiting network and hosting network or Localized service provider:\n-\tBusiness relationship / roaming interface exists between visiting network and hosting network or Localized service provider\n-\tIn this scenario, the visiting network knows about the hosting network or the Localized services. Therefore, UE can obtain hosting network information/localized service information from the visiting network. In order to enable control from home network, home network authorization is required before sending the information to the UE.\n-\tIn this scenario, UE cannot use credentials from home network to access hosting network. Therefore, other credentials e.g. default credentials can be used to access hosting network.\n-\tNo business relationship between visiting network and hosting network/ Localized service provider\nIn this scenario, neither home network or visiting network know about the hosting network or the Localized service. The UE can only obtain hosting network information/ localized service information from hosting network or the Localized service provider.\n-\tUE obtains localized service information from hosting network\n-\tin this scenario, manual network selection is used for hosting network discovery and selection;\n-\tdefault credentials are used for the first time accessing to hosting network;\n-\tcredentials of hosting network can be provision to the UE.\n-\tUE obtains hosting network information/ localized service information from Localized service provider\n-\tIn this scenario, the UE may also obtain the following information from the Localized service provider:\n-\tdefault credentials to access hosting network;\n-\tcredentials to access localized service from the Localized service provider;\n-\tconfigurations to access localized service from the hosting network;\n-\tThe above procedure is considered as OTT solution and would have no standard specifications.\nAlthough the first scenario (i.e. Business relationship / roaming interface exists between home network and hosting network or Localized service provider) is considered as the main scenario, it would be benefit to consider the other scenarios to support flexible deployments of hosting networks.",

Whether home network can act as CH can be implicitly determined by whether there are priority lists for SNPN selection configured/provisioned on UE.

      "content": "Table 7.5-1: Summary of solutions for KI#5\nSolution #7\nThe solution provides the high level entities and procedures for providing access to localized services, accessing localized/home services, and charging information for the home network operator.\nSolution #11\nSolution is reusing existing roaming architecture and LADN mechanism.The UE uses the local breakout session for accessing specific services from hosting network and home routed session for accessing services from the home network. Only PNI-NPN as Hosting Network is considered.\nSolution #13\nThe UE will be configured with the N3IWF address of the home network, wherein for accessing the home network services. The UE uses the hosting network as an underlay network.\nSolution #15\nThe solution focuses more on KI#4.\nSolution #18\nSolution proposes to use the existing mechanism i.e. Steering of Roaming to allow the service provider (PLMN or 3rd Party service provider) to update the UE with required information on availability of hosting networks along with the localized services they are providing.\nSteering of Roaming information container would carry the \"operator defined hosting network selector list\", which will assist the UE to switch to hosting network for obtaining localized services.\nSolution #27\nSolution is reusing N3IWF overlay architecture and LADN mechanism, i.e. 5G System architecture with access to SNPN using credentials from Credentials Holder and 5G System architecture accessing overlay network (home network) via underlay network (hosting network). The solution is built on top of solution #11.\nSolution #28\nThe UE (User) obtains the time restricted credentials from the LSP via the home network and uses that information for selection of hosting network as well as to access localized services. N3IWF node used to access home network services.\nSolution #35\nThe home network provides URSP which maps local services to its S-NSSAI and DNN. The registration of the S-NSSAI related to local services causes the cell/network reselection.\nSolution #36\nThere are two options are presented, one is using validity conditions provided by home network to UE to make sure UE only access the hosting network with satisfying those conditions. The other options presents that, home network and UE coordinate, wherein home network would either use the UE location to get information about target suitable hosting network performance information via target hosting network (e.g. SNPN) NEF or home network would instruct the UE to measure and report the signal reception status of the potential target hosting network(s). Based on the information received from the UE, the home network would send SoR (Steering of Roaming) instructions to steer the UE toward the target hosting network (e.g. SNPN).\nSolution #37\nThe solution defines a new network function LSF (Localized Service Function) in the home network and hosting network that specifically handles information related to localized services. The new network function will provide information to AMF about all available localized services at the UE location and this information about localized services will be shared with the UE via NAS signalling.\nSolution #40\nThe solution focuses more on KI#4 and for KI#5, it is regarding to how the home network steers UE to the hosting network. The solution proposes to use deregistration procedure to trigger the steering of UE to hosting network. The AMF/SMF supports configuring the mapping of [Credential Information] and [Hosting network identifier] for specific localized service and responds to UE with proper [Credential Information] associated with a hosting network SNPN. The home network AMF informs NG-RAN regarding the target hosting network identifier based on request from UE and let NG-RAN to perform release and redirect UE to the target network. It has impact on UE/NG-RAN/AMF.\nSolution #45\nThe solution reuses the LADN mechanism with some enhancements. The enhancements are:\n-\tUE shall support including localized service identifiers in PDU Session Establishment Request.\n-\tAMF determines the location conditions of the UE to decide whether the UE meets the conditions that allow it to obtain the localized service.\n-\tSMF determines whether the UE meets the validity information of the localized services. If the validity information is set to the location, the SMF subscribes UE mobility event notification to AMF. If the validity information is set to time, the SMF monitors the duration that the UE can access the localized services. If the UE does not meet the conditions, SMF receives a notification from the AMF, and instructs the UPF to stop forwarding traffic flow of the localized service. The solution has UE, AMF and SMF impacts.\nFor the above, the condition is assumed that UE has registered to a Hosting network and the UE wants to establish the PDU Session for access the localized services available in the currently registered Hosting network.\nSolution #46\nThe solution reuses existing URSP procedures, wherein the UE evaluates the URSP rules to use the PDU session for accessing the localized services in the hosting network. The time window and location criteria are configured according to the validity information of the localized services and only when the RSD criteria of the matched URSP rules are satisfied, the UE establishes a new PDU session or re-uses the existing PDU session for the localized services. There are UE and H-PCF/V-PCF impacts.\nFurthermore, the solution also describes the order if the UE has multiple URSP rules from HPLMN or from the subscribed SNPN.\nFor the above, the condition is assumed that UE has registered to a Hosting network and the UE wants to establish the PDU Session for access the localized services available in the currently registered Hosting network.\nIn several solutions (e.g. #18, #36, etc.) , existing SoR mechanism with some enhancement is proposed to be used for the home network to steer the UE to the hosting network. This approach addresses the KI well and has limited impacts on the UE and network.\nIn the solutions (e.g. #18, #36, etc.), the typical conditions for steering the UE to a specific hosting network are:\n-\tThe time and location of UE has met the validity condition of a local service (e.g. #18).\n-\tsignal threshold which may be different for different localized services / hosting networks has met the validity condition of the hosting networks (e.g. #36).\nFor the aspect of enabling access to both home network services and local services, several solutions propose to use existing overlay/underlay architecture to access the target network through N3IWF. This approach addresses the KI well and has limited impacts on the UE and network.\n-\tWhen a UE accesses both a hosting network and a home network using the overlay/underlay architecture, the underlay can support the localized service requirements e.g. high throughput, low latency and the ability to apply the location requirements in a suitable way and therefore the UE better access the localized services through the underlay network.\n-\tAccording to the current specifications, when the visiting network is a PLMN, the home network shall be a PLMN. (Due to that a SNPN UE cannot access to a PLMN using SNPN credentials). When the UE is accessing a PNI-NPN hosting network, Home Routed PDU session can be established to access home network services. No need to use overlay/underlay architecture in this scenario.\nIn several solutions (e.g. #35, #46), existing network slicing and URSP mechanism with some enhancements are proposed to be used for the UE to access the Localized Services in the registered Hosting Network. These approaches address the KI well and have limited impacts on the UE and network.\nFor the aspect of enabling UE to access localized services based on the certain location and time condition of localized services, there are several methods as follows:\n-\tReusing the existing LADN mechanism (e.g. #11, #27) to meet the location condition. For the time condition, it is realized by AMF/operator that combines LADN DNN with validity time.\n-\tUsing the enhanced LADN mechanism (e.g. #45) to meet the location condition. For the time condition, it is realized by SMF monitors the service time after the UE starts obtaining the localized service.\nReusing the existing URSP mechanism (e.g. #35, #46) to meet the location and time condition. The Route Selection Validation Criteria (i.e. Time Window and Location Criteria) of the matched URSP rules should be fulfilled. Which is currently evaluated when establishing a PDU Session.",

      "section_title": "Key Issue #6: Support for returning to home network",
      "content": "The solutions for KI#6 are proposed to address the UEs returning from the Hosting Network to their Home Network (i.e. HPLMN/VPLMN, SNPN) when the Localized Services in the Hosting Network are completed. Under the condition, it may cause many UEs returning back to e.g. their Home Network and this may result in signalling overload in their Home Network.\nNOTE:\tHome Network is used, but the network selected by the UE depends on the UE's network selection and what networks are available e.g. UE can return to VPLMN different from the PLMN the UE was registered to before selecting the Hosting Network.\nWhen considering solution proposals for KI#6, there are two categories for handling signalling overload resulting from the UEs returning to their Home Network:\n1.\tThe avoidance-based method: it mitigates or avoids overload at home network and it can be further classified into three subcategories based on the principles in the proposed solutions,\na)\tthe UEs is (pre)-configured with a timer/waiting time based on the Validity Information of the Localized Services and/or the NWu status and the availability of the home network of the UE e.g. by the Home Network or by the Hosting Network,\nb) the home network negotiates/communicates once with the hosting network as part of a service level agreement to configure the number of UEs can be deregistered from the hosting network to the home network per unit time, and\nc) the home network negotiates/communicates with the hosting network continuously by utilizing “subscribe-notify” communication service to configure the number of UEs which can be deregistered from the hosting network to the home network per unit time adaptively without causing an overload at the home network, and the hosting network instructs UEs which exceed the home network given maximum limit to wait for random amount of time before initiating re-registration to their home network if UEs initiate deregistration requests.\n2.\tThe runtime-based method: it handles overload at home network using the existing mechanisms and it can be further classified into three subcategories based on the principles in the proposed solutions,\na)\tthe UEs directly return to their Home network when the Localized Services terminate and the Home Network will use the existing mechanisms to handle the signalling overload if the congestion happens,\nb)\tthe home network and/or local hosting network may group the UEs to create an Internal-Group Identifier specific to local hosting network(s) and/or local service(s), and then the home network AMF or SMF applies the existing UE group-specific NAS level congestion control mechanism to manage UEs returning from a local hosting network to their home network, and\nc) the UEs directly return to their home network when the Localized Services terminate and the home network uses localized hosting network specific back-off timer to adaptively reduce the overall waiting for UEs before re-register to their home network.\nFor avoidance-based method (i.e. Solutions #9, 10, 13, 25, 38, 47), hosting network either determines the timer or maximum number of UEs on its own (e.g. Solution #9, #10,) or uses the home network input to determine it (e.g. Sol#47).\nFor runtime-based method (i.e. Solutions #8, 17, 39), the Home Network applies the existing congestion control and overload control to the UEs for returning from the Hosting Network but cause congestion overload. The UEs registers to the Home Network by indicating they are back from the Hosting Network. If the Home Network is in a congestion condition, the Home Network can reject the UE with a cause and a back-off timer.\nTo compare the avoidance-based and runtime-based methods, the differences are below:\n-\tThe avoidance-based method can allow the UE to return to their Home Network in a distributed or stagged manner to prevent the congestion or overload conditions happen in their Home Network.\n-\tThe runtime-based method directly applies the existing mechanism optionally with some enhancement (e.g. hosting-network specific backoff timer).\nCategory 1-a of the avoidance-based method potentially delays the UEs return to the Home Network also for the cases when the Home Network is not overloaded/congested. It is also expected that the user itself can decide to stop using the Localized Service i.e. in these cases the UE would return back to the Home Network disregarding the spreading applied for the UE's return.\nThe runtime handling has allowed the UEs to initiate the Registration procedure as soon as wanted and then if the Home Network is congested rejected the UE with a back-off timer in which the Home Network has been through the signalling congestion from those returning UEs from the Hosting Networks (unless Home Network is so congested that e.g. UAC is used).\nTable 7.6-1: Summary of solutions for KI#6\nSolution #7\nHigh level flow for localized service support\n(Category: Not applicable)\nThe solution provides the high level entities and procedures for providing access to localized services.\nThis solution does not cover the impact on different entities, services, and interface, will be covered by other specific solutions.\nSolution #8\nReuse existing mechanisms for Control Plane Load Control, Congestion and Overload Control\n(Category: 2-a)\nThe proposed solution is to reuse existing mechanisms for Control Plane Load Control, Congestion and Overload Control, to mitigate signalling overload when large number of UEs return to their home network.\nAs the solution proposes to reuse the existing mechanisms, it is noted that there is no impact on services, entities and interfaces.\nThe existing mechanisms do not mitigate overload at home network when large number of UEs return to their home network after accessing a localized service. Moreover, assigning random back-off time values to UEs to initiate the next re-registration attempt at different time to reduce the signalling load would increase the overall waiting for UEs before re-register to their home network.\nSolution #9\nPrevention of overload build up at home network using AMF based congestion control when local service is over\n(Category: 1-a)\nThis solution proposes to deregister UEs accessed to localized services in a staggered manner before the termination of local hosting network. In order to achieve this, two mechanisms, namely, usage of network availability timers and specific cause code to trigger a controlled deregistration are proposed.\nThe solution assumes that the hosting network is able to determine the exact timing when the local service stops and UEs need to leave, which may not be the case for most scenarios.\nThe solution has an impact on UE and AMF. For the UE, the impact is to support new cause codes, service availability timer and related implementation. For the AMF, the impact is to handle new timer for UEs accessing to local services and to support new cause code in network-initiated de-registration request.\nThe solution prevents any overload condition cause by simultaneous registration request coming from all the returning UEs. However, a local hosting network may not know the actual capacity of the home network to deregister UEs accordingly to utilize the home network’s resources efficiently, and the overall waiting time of UEs would increase because each UE has to wait until the assigned random service availability timer expires.\nSolution #10\nSolution for discovery and selection of NPN hosting network and localized services\n(Category: 1-a)\nAlthough this solution mainly addresses KI#4, it also provides a solution for KI#6.\nIt is proposed that either the UE applies a random delay before initiating a PLMN selection or HPLMN (or Credentials Holder) configures UEs with slightly different end time to the validity time period.\nThe end time of validity condition may not always be the same as the real end time of the service. It can't be assumed that UE's returning to the home network is triggered by the time validity condition. Moreover, it would increase the overall waiting time of UEs if a local hosting network alters the service end time of UEs without knowing the actual capacity of the home network which handles returning UEs.\nSolution #13\nExposure enhancements to support providing access to localized services\n(Category: 1-a)\nThis solution proposes that the hosting network may group UEs based on the reported NWu status and the UEs home network availability when UEs return to their home network from the hosting network. The hosting network assigns a random back-off timer value to UEs based on which group the UEs belong to among four groups. Then, UEs should wait until the assigned back-off timer expires to initiate re-registration procedure to their home networks.\nThe solution has an impact on UE and AMF. The UE, when receiving the end indication of the localized service from the hosting network AMF, checks that all local services are ended, and reports Nwu interface status and related home network identity (e.g. PLMN ID) to the AMF.\nThe hosting network AMF groups the UEs and send back-off-timer to the UEs.\nThis solution would mitigate an overload at the home network. However, it may increase the overall waiting time for UEs before re-registering to their home network because the home network capacity and load condition are not considered by the hosting network.\nSolution #17\nUE Group specific NAS level congestion control\n(Category: 2-b)\nThe solution proposes to use group specific NAS level congestion control mechanism to mitigate user plane and control plane overload. The home network associates UEs temporarily accessing localized services to an Internal-Group Identifier, which can be specific to each local hosting network and/or service and applies UE group-specific NAS level congestion during the return of UEs.\nThe solution has an impact on UE/AMF to support localized service related de-registration information, NEF to support exposure from local hosting networks, UDM to support local hosting network/service information in Internal-Group identifier and AMF/SMF to apply Group Specific NAS level congestion control.\nThis solution requires UE to request registration in the home network and then the AMF of the home network applies UE group-specific NAS level congestion control. Naturally, this solution does not prevent an overload condition as the RAN and the AMF will get registration request from all the returning UE and this may lead to increased load in the system. Moreover, assigning random back-off time values to UEs to initiate the next re-registration attempt at different time to reduce the signalling load would increase the overall waiting for UEs before re-register to their home network.\nSolution #25\n(Category: 1-a)\nAlthough this solution mainly addresses KI #4, it also provides a solution for KI #6.\nThis solution proposes that the home network UDM/SOR-AF can set an offset value to the authorized start/stop time for UEs as part of enabling Temporary Network Reselection procedure in order to avoid congestion/overload at the home network.\nThis solution potentially can mitigate the congestion/overload at the home network. However, setting offset value to the start/stop time for UEs in a pre-determined way would increase the overall waiting time for UEs before re-register to their Home Network.\nSolution #38\nSequential deregistration by hosting network\n(Category: 1-b)\nThis solution proposes to control the number of returning UE based on service level agreement between the home network and hosting network.\nThe solution relies on that the hosting network can group the UEs according to their home network, but it remains unclear how it is achieved. Moreover, it may not mitigate the congestion/overload at the home network because the congestion level at the home network may vary overtime based on the number of UEs returning from different hosting networks to their home network. Hence, a continuous communication/negotiation between the home network and the hosting networks are expected and not considered in the proposed solution.\nThe solution has an impact on UE and AMF. For the UE, the impact is to support finishing deregistration procedure where the termination of the localized service is indicated by AMF and to support return of the UE to its home network. For the AMF, the impact is to support indication of localized service termination as part of the Deregistration request message and to support triggering deregistration in a sequence manner in a way that the maximum number of returning UEs at a given units of time does not exceed the configured number at AMF.\nSolution #39\nLocal hosting network specific back-off timer\n(Category: 2-c)\nThis solution proposes a local hosting network-specific flexible back-off timer range and back-off timer assignment to spread out the registration attempts over time and limit the number of users attempting to register back to their home network simultaneously in order to avoid signalling overload and unnecessary waiting times for the returning users.\nThe solution effectively avoids using uniformed non-optimal back-off timers for all UEs.\nThe solution has an impact on UE and AMF. For the UE, the impact is to support sending the local network indication as part of the new registration request (\"re-registration from hosting network\" or \"local network access indication\"). For the AMF, the impact is to support new registration type/indicator related to local hosting network re-registration and assignment of a local hosting network-specific back-off timer range.\nThis solution requires UE to request registration in the home network and then the AMF of the home network provides a back-off timer. This solution does not prevent an overload condition as the RAN and AMF will get registration request from all the returning UE and this may lead to increased load in the system.\nThough this solution may not mitigate an overload at the home network, it can reduce the overall waiting time for UEs before re-register to their home network by setting local hosting network specific back-off timer in an adaptive manner.\nSolution #47\n(Category: 1-c)\nThis solution solves the problem of overloading at home network and reducing the unnecessary waiting time of UEs before re-register to their home network. The proposed solution deregisters UEs from the hosting network to the home network in an adaptive manner based on the input from the home network (i.e. the allowed maximum number of returning UEs from the hosting network to the home network AMF per unit time based on the network load condition at the home network). If network condition varies at the home network, then the home network AMF notifies a new value (i.e. the new allowed maximum number of returning UEs per unit time) to the hosting network in a new notification such that the number of UEs deregistered from the hosting network to the home network can be controlled adaptively to mitigate an overload/congestion at the home network.\nThis solution has an impact on UE, AMF, and UDM. For the UE, the impact is to support to wait for a random amount of time before initiating re-registration procedure to the Home Network if the number of UEs attempting to return to the Home Network exceeds the given maximum allowed value for the case of UEs initiate the Deregistration Request. For the AMF, the impact is to support to determine the hosting network and the localized service specific the maximum allowed number of returning UEs to the home network. For the UDM, the impact is to support to coordinate with the hosting network AMFs for selection of the allowed maximum number of returning UEs to the home network based on the notification from the home network AMF.\nThis solution effectively avoids an overload/congestion at the Home Network, efficiently utilizes the available resources in the home network AMF, and does not hold UEs to wait unnecessarily. This solution also supports to handle UE-initiated deregistration requests and instructs UEs to wait random amount of time before attempting re-registration to their home network if the number of UEs initiated deregistration requests exceeds the home network given maximum value to mitigate the overload at the home network.\nIn the avoidance-based solutions (Category 1), there are three subcategories based on the principles used to address the requirements mentioned in the KI #6, which are summarized as follows:\n-\tCategory 1-a based solutions are based on the principle of pre-configuring UEs service end time either by the home network or hosting network to spread out the registration attempts over time and limit the number of simultaneous attempts in a very short period of time in order to mitigate an overload/congestion at the home network. Though the category 1-a based solutions potentially mitigate the overload at home network, they would increase the overall waiting time for UEs before registering to their home network as all UEs are pre-configured to make re-registration attempt to their home network at different point in time without knowing the actual capacity of the home network AMF.\n-\tCategory 1-b based solutions are based on the principle of one-time negotiation/communication between the home network and the hosting network to deregister the number of UEs simultaneously per unit time from the hosting network to the home network without causing overload/congestion at the home network. Since it’s a one-time negotiation/communication between the home network and the hosting network as part of a service level agreement and the actual load in the home network may vary over time, the constant/fixed number of deregistration of UEs from the hosting network to the home network may lead to congestion/overload. Also, if the home network is in a position to handle more of UEs that it was communicated/negotiated earlier, then UEs in the hosting network may have to wait unnecessarily.\n-\tCategory 1-c based solutions are based on the principle of negotiating/communicating the home network AMF capacity with the hosting network continuously to deregister the number of UEs simultaneously per unit time from the hosting network to the home network without causing overload/congestion at the home network. Since the home network and the hosting network are negotiating/communicating continuously using subscribe-notify communication service, the load variation in the home network due to less or high number of attempts from the home network and other hosting networks UEs is notified to the hosting network as a new maximum threshold value (i.e. the new allowed maximum number of returning UEs per unit time) in a new notification. Hence, the hosting network can deregister the number of UEs adaptively based on the current capacity of the home network AMF without causing overload/congestion at the home network. Also, it minimizes the overall waiting time for UEs before re-registering to their network and utilizes the available resources in the home network AMF efficiently.\nIn the runtime-based solutions (Category 2), there are three subcategories based on the principles used to address the requirements mentioned in the KI #6, which are summarized as follows:\n-\tCategory 2-a based solutions reuse the existing mechanisms without any additional enhancements. However, the existing mechanisms do not avoid an overload/congestion at the home network when a high number of UEs attempt to return from the hosting network to their home network in a short period of time. Moreover, the existing mechanisms would increase the overall waiting time of UEs as the existing mechanisms use the same pre-defined range for assigning random back-off timer value to all UEs irrespective of their size and service type they used.\n-\tCategory 2-b based solutions are based on the principle of grouping UEs to create an Internal-Group Identifier specific to local hosting network(s) and/or local service(s) and then reusing the existing UE group-specific NAS level congestion control mechanism to manage UEs returning from a local hosting network to their home network. However, the existing mechanisms do not avoid overload and would increase the overall waiting time of users since the same pre-defined range is used for assigning random back-off timer value to all UEs irrespective of their size and service type they used.\n-\tCategory 2-c based solutions are based on the principle of assigning a local hosting network specific back-off timer value in order to reduce the overall waiting for UEs before re-register to their home network.\nA UE returning from a Hosting Network after using a Localized Service would normally not have higher priority than any other UEs, i.e. the prioritization among UEs would better follow existing mechanisms and therefore adding a separate indication that the UE is returning from the Hosting Network as an indication to the Home Network can be questioned. However, as the avoidance-based method potentially delays the UEs return to the Home Network also for the cases when the Home Network is not overloaded/congested, unless a frequent load check is introduced, it is better to allow the UE return as soon as the Localized Service ends or whenever the UE (e.g. user) decides to stop using the Localized Service and therefore leaves the Hosting Network before the end of the Localized Service. The end time of the Localized Service can be adapted on application layer by existing means i.e. without 3GPP impacts.",

Specifically:\n-\tWhen UE registers to SNPN with credentials owned by the SNPN, UE uses the same N3IWF selection procedure as specified for access to stand-alone non-public network services via PLMN in clause 6.3.6.2a of TS 23.501 [3].\n-\tUE initiates N3IWF selection for emergency services when the UE detects a user request for emergency session and determines that Untrusted non-3GPP access is to be used for the emergency access. The UE with SNPN subscription performs the following:\n-\tIf the UE determines that it is located in the same country as the subscribed SNPN, the UE uses the configured N3IWF FQDN for N3IWF selection.\n-\tOtherwise, the UE follows the N3IWF selection procedure for Emergency services for UE not equipped with UICC, as defined in clause 6.3.6.4.2 of TS 23.501 [3].\n-\tWhen the UE is registering to SNPN over Untrusted N3GPP access for UE Onboarding, UE may select a N3IWF in the SNPN which supports UE Onboarding by using the pre-configured N3IWF FQDN used for onboarding.\nNOTE 1:\tThe GIN is not used to construct a N3IWF FQDN if a UE is registering to SNPN over Untrusted N3GPP access.\nNOTE 2:\tThe format of FQDN will be specified by CT WG4.\n-\tIf the PVS is reachable from the local Untrusted non-3GPP access network (e.g. via the Internet) using the local IP connectivity, UE may connect directly (i.e. without connected to a N3WIF) with a PVS to obtain the SNPN credentials.\n-\tAccess to SNPN services via Trusted non-3GPP access network is to be specified according to the principles described in Solution #3, including support for credential Holder, Emergency services and UE onboarding.
