It is the UAE Server responsibility to check whether the service API consumer (e.g., UASS) is authorized to use an API based on the provided \"token\". Once the UAE Server verifies the \"token\", it shall check whether the UAE Server identifier in the \"token\" matches its own published identifier, and whether the API name in the \"token\" matches its own published API name. If those checks are passed, the service API consumer (e.g., UASS) has full authority to access any resource or operation provided by the invoked API.\nNOTE 2:\tFor the aforementioned security methods, the UAE Server needs to apply admission control according to access control policies after performing the authorization checks.\nAnnex A (normative):OpenAPI specification\nA.1\tGeneral\nThis Annex specifies the formal definition of the API(s) defined in the present specification. It consists of OpenAPI specifications in YAML format.\nThis Annex takes precedence when being discrepant to other parts of the specification with respect to the encoding of information elements and methods within the API(s).\nNOTE 1:\tThe semantics and procedures, as well as conditions, e.g. for the applicability and allowed combinations of attributes or values, not expressed in the OpenAPI definitions but defined in other parts of the specification also apply.\nInformative copies of the OpenAPI specification files contained in this 3GPP Technical Specification are available on a Git-based repository that uses the GitLab software version control system (see clause 5.3.1 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [3] and clause 5B of 3GPP TR 21.900 [5]).\nA.2\tUAE_C2OperationModeManagement API\nopenapi: 3.0.0\ninfo:\ntitle: UAE Server C2 Operation Mode Management Service\nversion: 1.1.0\ndescription: |\nUAE Server C2 Operation Mode Management Service.\n© 2024, 3GPP Organizational Partners (ARIB, ATIS, CCSA, ETSI, TSDSI, TTA, TTC).\nAll rights reserved.\nexternalDocs:\ndescription: >\n3GPP TS 29.257 V18.4.0; Application layer support for Uncrewed Aerial System (UAS);\nUAS Application Enabler (UAE) Server Services; Stage 3.\nurl: https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/29_series/29.257/\nservers:\n- url: '{apiRoot}/uae-c2opmode-mngt/v1'\nvariables:\napiRoot:\ndefault: https://example.com\ndescription: apiRoot as defined in clause 5.2.4 of 3GPP TS 29.122\nsecurity:\n- {}\n- oAuth2ClientCredentials: []\npaths:\n/initiate:\npost:\nsummary: Request the provisioning of C2 Operation Mode configuration information for a UAS (i.e. pair of UAV and UAV-C).\noperationId: InitiateC2OpModeConfig\ntags:\n- Initiate C2 Operation Mode configuration\nrequestBody:\nrequired: true\ncontent:\napplication/json:\nschema:\n$ref: '#/components/schemas/ConfigureData'\nresponses:\n'200':\ndescription: >\nThe communicated C2 Operation Mode configuration information was successfully\nreceived.
