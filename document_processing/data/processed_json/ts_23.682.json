      "content": "The end-to-end communications, between the MTC Application in the UE and the MTC Application in the external network, uses services provided by the 3GPP system, and optionally services provided by a Services Capability Server (SCS).\nThe MTC Application in the external network is typically hosted by an Application Server (AS) and may make use of an SCS for additional value added services. The 3GPP system provides transport, subscriber management and other communication services including various architectural enhancements motivated by, but not restricted to, MTC (e.g. control plane device triggering).\nDifferent models are foreseen for machine type of traffic in what relates to the communication between the AS and the 3GPP system (refer to Annex A) and based on the provider of the SCS. The different architectural models that are supported by the Architectural Reference Model in clause 4.2 include the following:\n-\tDirect Model - The AS connects directly to the operator network in order to perform direct user plane communications with the UE without the use of any external SCS. The Application in the external network may make use of services offered by the 3GPP system;\n-\tIndirect Model - The AS connects indirectly to the operator network through the services of a SCS in order to utilize additional value added services for MTC (e.g. control plane device triggering). The SCS is either:\n-\tMTC Service Provider controlled: The SCS is an entity that may include value added services for MTC, performing user plane and/or control plane communication with the UE. Tsp is regarded as an inter-domain interface for control plane communication; or\n-\t3GPP network operator controlled: The SCS is a mobile operator entity that may include value added services for MTC and performs user plane and/or control plane communication with the UE, making Tsp a control plane interface internal to the PLMN;\n-\tHybrid Model: The AS uses the direct model and indirect models simultaneously in order to connect directly to the operator's network to perform direct user plane communications with the UE while also using a SCS. From the 3GPP network perspective, the direct user plane communication from the AS and any value added control plane related communications from the SCS are independent and have no correlation to each other even though they may be servicing the same MTC Application hosted by the AS.\nWhen using the hybrid model, the MTC Service provider controlled SCS, and the 3GPP operator controlled SCS may offer different capabilities to the MTC Applications.\nSince the different models are not mutually exclusive, but just complementary, it is possible for a 3GPP operator to combine them for different applications. This may include a combination of both MTC Service Provider and 3GPP network operator controlled SCSs communicating with the same PLMN.",

      "content": "Figures 4.2-1a and 4.2-1b show the architecture for a UE used for MTC connecting to the 3GPP network (UTRAN, WB-E-UTRAN, NB-IoT, GERAN, etc.) via the Um/Uu/LTE-Uu interfaces or satellite access interface for NB-IoT, WB-E-UTRAN and LTE-M. They also show the 3GPP network service capability exposure to SCS and AS. The architecture covers the various architectural models described in clause 4.1.\nFigure 4.2-1a: 3GPP Architecture for Machine-Type Communication (non-roaming)\nFigure 4.2-1b: 3GPP Architecture for Machine-Type Communication (Roaming)\nFigure 4.2-2 shows the overall architecture for Service Capability Exposure which enables the 3GPP network to securely expose its services and capabilities provided by 3GPP network interfaces to external 3rd party service provider SCS/AS hosting an Application(s).\nFigure 4.2-2: 3GPP Architecture for Service Capability Exposure\nFigure 4.2-3: 3GPP roaming Architecture for Service Capability Exposure\nFigure 4.2-4 shows the overall architecture for RACS which enables provisioning of RACS database information in the 3GPP network.\nFigure 4.2-4: 3GPP Architecture for RACS\nNOTE 1:\tRefer to TS 23.002 [5], TS 23.060 [6], TS 23.401 [7], TS 23.272 [11] and TS 23.040 [12] for the details of 3GPP network-internal reference points not specifically shown or labelled in figure 4.2-1a, figure 4.2-1b, figure 4.2-2, or described in this specification.\nNOTE 2:\tThe SCS is controlled by the operator of the HPLMN or by a MTC Service Provider.\nNOTE 3:\tIn the non-roaming case, all 3GPP network entities providing functionality for MTC are in the same PLMN. In the roaming case, 3GPP architecture for MTC supports both the home routed (illustrated in Figures 4.2-1a and 4.2-1b) and the local-breakout roaming (not illustrated) scenarios. For the home routed scenario, the MTC Server/Application User Plane communication is routed through the HPLMN. In the local breakout scenario, the User Plane communication is routed directly through the serving PLMN/VPLMN over deployed GGSN/P-GW.\nNOTE 4:\tFigure 4.2-2 does not include all the interfaces and network elements that may be connected to SCEF.\nNOTE 5:\tFigure 4.2-3 does not include all the interfaces and network elements that may be connected to an Interworking SCEF (IWK-SCEF).\nThe SCS is an entity which connects to the 3GPP network to communicate with UEs used for MTC and the MTC-IWF and/or SCEF in the HPLMN. The SCS offers capabilities for use by one or multiple MTC Applications. A UE can host one or multiple MTC Applications. The corresponding MTC Applications in the external network are hosted on one or multiple ASs.\nTsms is the interface that encompasses all the various proprietary SMS-SC to SME interface standards (see TR 23.039 [14]) and is outside the scope of 3GPP specifications. Tsms can be used to send a trigger to a UE encapsulated in a MT-SMS as an over-the-top application by any network entity (e.g. SCS) acting as a SME. Tsp is a 3GPP standardized interface to facilitate value-added services motivated by MTC (e.g. control plane device triggering) and provided by a SCS.\nT8 is the interface between the SCEF and the SCS/AS. SCEF exposed network services can be accessed by SCS/AS through APIs over T8 interface. In the indirect model, the SCS and the Application Server hosting Application(s) can be collocated.\nFor the roaming scenario, the MTC-IWF shall have the connection with HSS and SMS-SC within the home network only as shown in the figure 4.2-1b.\nThe Service Capability Exposure Function (SCEF) is the key entity within the 3GPP architecture for service capability exposure that provides a means to securely expose the services and capabilities provided by 3GPP network interfaces. In standalone MTC-IWF deployment, MTC-IWF functionality (e.g. T4 triggering) is made available to the SCS/AS via the Tsp interface. In certain deployments, the MTC-IWF may be co-located with the SCEF in which case MTC-IWF functionality is exposed to the SCS/AS via T8 interface (i.e. API). In deployments where MTC-IWF is not co-located with SCEF, interactions between MTC-IWF and SCEF are left up to the implementation.\nThe trust domain (see figure 4.2-2) cover entities that are protected by adequate network domain security. The entities and interfaces within the trust domain may all be within one operator's control, or some may be controlled by a trusted business partner which has a trust relationship with the operator e.g. another operator or a 3rd party. The security requirements for the trust domain are out of scope of this specification.\nWhen the SCEF belongs to a trusted business partner of the HPLMN, it is still seen as an HPLMN entity by other HPLMN or VPLMN functional entities invoked by the SCEF (e.g. HSS, MME).\nApplications operating in the trust domain may require only a subset of functionalities (e.g. authentication, authorization, etc.) provided by the SCEF. Applications operating in the trust domain can also access network entities (e.g. PCRF), wherever the required 3GPP interface(s) are made available, directly without the need to go through the SCEF.\nThe Interworking SCEF (IWK-SCEF) is optional. When deployed, the IWK-SCEF is located in the VPLMN as shown in the figure 4.2-1b.",

Device Triggering is required when an IP address for the UE is not available or reachable by the SCS/AS.\nDevice trigger message contains information that allows the network to route the message to the appropriate UE and the UE to route the message to the appropriate application. The information destined to the application, along with the information to route it, is referred to as the Trigger payload. The UE needs to be able to distinguish an MT message carrying device triggering information from any other type of messages.\nNOTE:\tThe Trigger payload, for example, upon the reception by the UE possibly provides information to the application that may trigger application related actions. The application in the UE may perform indicated actions, such as for example to initiate immediate or later communication to the SCS/AS, based on the information contained in the Trigger payload.\nDevice Triggering is subscription based. The subscription provides the information whether a UE is allowed to be triggered by a specific SCS. When device triggers are delivered via MT-SMS the serving nodes MME, SGSN and MSC provide the service towards a specific UE based on the UE's subscription for MT-SMS and other subscription parameters affecting MT-SMS service provision.\nDevice triggering recall/replace functionality allows a SCS to recall or replace previously submitted trigger messages which are not yet delivered to the UE.\nCharging data are collected for the device triggering. The MTC-IWF generates CDRs for the service requester. When device triggers are delivered via MT-SMS then network entities, like MME, SGSN, MSC or SMS-SC generate CDRs for SMS services provided for the mobile subscriber.",

Therefore, a subscription intended for PS-only service provision may allow also for SMS services via CS domain to provide a UE with SMS services in situations when serving node or network don't support SMS via PS domain NAS. The functionality that enables PS-only service provision is described in TS 23.060 [6] and TS 23.272 [11].\nThe functionality that enables PS-only service provision for SMS delivery in IMS is described in TS 23.204 [13].",

      "content": "A UE may adopt the PSM for reducing its power consumption. That mode is similar to power-off, but the UE remains registered with the network and there is no need to re-attach or re-establish PDN connections. A UE in PSM is not immediately reachable for mobile terminating services. A UE using PSM is available for mobile terminating services during the time it is in connected mode and for the period of an Active Time that is after the connected mode. The connected mode is caused by a mobile originated event like data transfer or signalling, e.g. after a periodic TAU/RAU procedure. PSM is therefore intended for UEs that are expecting only infrequent mobile originating and terminating services and that can accept a corresponding latency in the mobile terminating communication.\nFor mobile terminated data while a UE is in PSM, the functions for High latency communication may be used as described in clause 4.5.7.\nPSM has no support in the CS domain on the network side. PSM should only be used by UEs using the PS domain, SMS and mobile originated IMS or CS services. A UE that uses mobile terminated CS services other than SMS should not use PSM as the CS domain does not provide support for mobile terminated CS voice services to UEs that are in PSM. A UE that uses delay tolerant mobile terminated IMS services other than SMS should not request for PSM unless IMS uses the functions for High latency communication as described in clause 4.5.7.\nNOTE 1:\tThe frequency of keep-alive messages on Gm impacts the possibility to use IMS services for UEs applying PSM.\nApplications that want to use the PSM need to consider specific handling of mobile terminating services or data transfers. A network side application may send an SMS or a device trigger to trigger an application on UE to initiate communication with the SCS/AS, which is delivered when the UE becomes reachable. Alternatively a network side application may request monitoring of reachability for data to receive a notification when it is possible to send downlink data immediately to the UE, which is when the UE becomes reachable for downlink data transfer. Alternatively, if an SCS/AS has periodic downlink data, it is more efficient when the UE initiates communication with the SCS/AS to poll for downlink data with that period. For either of the options to work, the UE should request an Active Time that is together with the time being in connected mode long enough to allow for potential mobile terminated service or data delivery, e.g. to deliver an SMS.\nWhen the UE wants to use the PSM it shall request an Active Time value during every Attach and TAU/RAU procedures. If the network supports PSM and accepts that the UE uses PSM, the network confirms usage of PSM by allocating an Active Time value to the UE. The network takes the UE requested value, the Maximum Response Time (defined in clause 5.6.1.4), if provided with the Insert Subscriber Data or Update Location Ack message from HSS, and any local MME/SGSN configuration into account for determining the Active Time value that is allocated to the UE. If the UE wants to change the Active Time value, e.g. when the conditions are changed in the UE, the UE consequently requests the value it wants in the TAU/RAU procedure.\nNOTE 2:\tThe minimum recommended length for the Active Time is the time allowing for the 'msg waiting flag' in the MME/SGSN to trigger the SMSC via the HSS to deliver an SMS to the MME/SGSN, e.g. 2 DRX cycles plus 10 seconds.\nNOTE 3:\tThe Maximum Response Time value can be configured as desired Active Time value in the HSS via O&M.\nAn Active Time may be shorter than the time estimated for delivering a waiting SMS to the UE in NOTE 2 above, e.g. 0 seconds. If the MME/SGSN allocates such a shorter Active Time to the UE, the MME/SGSN (for signalling only connections and if the 'msg waiting flag' is set) and the RAN (for connections with RAB(s) set up) should be configured to keep the connection with the UE sufficiently long such that a waiting SMS can be delivered.\nNOTE 4:\tThe RAN configuration of RAB connection times need not differentiate between UEs.\nIf the MME/SGSN is requested to monitor for Reachability for Data, the MME/SGSN (for signalling only connections) and the RAN (for connections with RAB(s) set up) should keep the connection for the Maximum Response Time less the Active Time, if Maximum Response Time is provided with the Insert Subscriber Data message from HSS. Otherwise a configured default Maximum Response Time is assumed by the MME/SGSN.\nThe UE is in PSM until a mobile originated event (e.g. periodic RAU/TAU, mobile originated data or detach) requires the UE to initiate any procedure towards the network. In Attach and RAU/TAU procedures a PSM capable UE may request a periodic TAU/RAU Timer value suitable for the latency/responsiveness of the mobile terminated services. If the UE wants to change the periodic TAU/RAU Timer value, e.g. when the conditions are changed in the UE, the UE consequently requests the value it wants in the TAU/RAU procedure.\nNOTE 5:\tIf the UE or application performs any periodic uplink data transfer with a periodicity similar to the Periodic TAU/RAU Timer value, it preferably requests a Periodic TAU/RAU Timer value that is at least slightly larger than the data transfer period to avoid periodic TAU/RAU procedures that would increase power consumption.\nAny timers and conditions that remain valid during power-off, e.g. NAS-level back-off timers, apply in the same way during PSM. The UE may leave the PSM any time, e.g. for mobile originated communications.\nIf the network confirms the usage of PSM to a UE, the network shall not activate the ISR for such UE.\nThe specific procedure handling is described in TS 23.060 [6] and TS 23.401 [7].",

      "content": "Functions for High latency communication may be used to handle mobile terminated (MT) communication with UEs being unreachable while using power saving functions e.g. UE Power Saving Mode (see clause 4.5.4) or extended idle mode DRX (see clause 4.5.13) depending on operator configuration. \"High latency\" refers to the initial response time before normal exchange of packets is established. That is, the time it takes before a UE has woken up from its power saving state and responded to the initial downlink packet(s).\nHigh latency communication is handled by an extended buffering of downlink data in the Serving GW controlled by the MME/S4-SGSN or in the Gn/Gp-SGSN. The MME/S4-SGSN asks the Serving GW to buffer downlink data until the UE is expected to wake up from its power saving state. The Gn/Gp-SGSN similarly buffers downlink data until the UE is expected to wake up from its power saving state. If a Serving GW change or a Gn/Gp-SGSN change is invoked, the buffered packets are forwarded and will not be lost. The number of packets to buffer is decided by the Serving GW or Gn/Gp-SGSN, but the MME/S4-SGSN may optionally provide a suggestion for the number of downlink packets to be buffered based on the information received from the HSS. The information received from the HSS may be subscription based or may be based on information provided by the SCS/AS during the configuration of the event, see clause 5.6.1.4.\nFor Control Plane CIoT EPS optimisation, High latency communication is handled by the buffering of downlink data in the Serving GW or the MME as described in TS 23.401 [7].\nHigh latency communication may also be handled by notification procedures (see clause 5.7), when an MME/S4-SGSN is used (i.e. this procedure does not apply to a Gn/Gp-SGSN). The SCS/AS requests notification when a UE wakes up from its power saving state and sends downlink data to the UE when the UE is reachable. Especially for infrequent mobile terminated communication this may be suitable. This notification procedure is available based on two different monitoring events:\n-\tMonitoring event: UE Reachability; or\n-\tMonitoring event: Availability after DDN failure.\nAn SCS/AS may request a one-time \"UE Reachability\" notification when it wants to send data to the UE. Alternatively the SCS/AS may request repeated \"Availability after DDN failure\" notifications where each notification is triggered by a DDN failure i.e. the SCS/AS sends a downlink packet which is discarded by Serving GW but which triggers the MME/SGSN to send an event notification to the SCS/AS next time the UE wakes up.\nWhen requesting to be informed of either \"UE Reachability\" or \"Availability after DDN failure\" notification, the SCS/AS may also request Idle Status Indication. If the HSS and the MME/SGSN support Idle Status Indication, then when the UE for which PSM or extended idle mode DRX is enabled transitions into idle mode, the MME/SGSN includes the time at which the UE transitioned into idle mode, the active time and the periodic TAU/RAU time granted to the UE by the MME/SGSN in the notification towards the SCEF, the eDRX cycle length and the Suggested number of downlink packets if a value was provided to the S-GW.\nThe length of the power saving intervals used by the network decides the maximum latency for a UE. An SCS/AS, which has a specific requirement on the maximum latency for UEs it communicates with, may provide its maximum latency requirement to the network. This is done either by interaction with the application in the UE and setting of appropriate time values in the UE (e.g. periodic RAU/TAU timer) for the Power Saving Mode, or by providing the maximum latency at the configuration of the \"UE reachability\" monitoring event (if used) (see clause 5.7).\nThe tools for High latency communication make the behaviour of the 3GPP network predictable when sending mobile terminated data to UEs applying power saving functions. The network will deliver downlink packets with high reliability for both stationary and mobile UEs when the UE wakes up from its power saving state. Therefore SCS/AS can adapt its retransmissions to reduce the load on both the SCS/AS itself and the network.",

      "content": "The UE and the network may negotiate over non-access stratum signalling the use of extended idle mode DRX for reducing its power consumption, while being available for mobile terminating data and/or network originated procedures within a certain delay dependent on the DRX cycle value.\nApplications that want to use extended idle mode DRX need to consider specific handling of mobile terminating services or data transfers, and in particular they need to consider the delay tolerance of mobile terminated data. A network side application may send mobile terminated data, an SMS, or a device trigger, and needs to be aware that extended idle mode DRX may be in place. A UE should request for extended idle mode DRX only when all expected mobile terminating communication is tolerant to delay.\nA UE that uses mobile terminated CS services other than SMS should not request for extended idle mode DRX as the CS domain does not provide support for mobile terminated CS voice services to UEs that are in extended idle mode DRX. A UE that uses delay tolerant mobile terminated IMS services other than SMS should not request for extended idle mode DRX unless IMS uses the functions for High latency communication as described in clause 4.5.7.\nNOTE 1:\tThe frequency of keep-alive messages on Gm impacts the possibility to use IMS services for UEs applying extended idle mode DRX.\nIn order to negotiate the use of extended idle mode DRX, the UE requests extended idle mode DRX parameters during attach procedure and RAU/TAU procedure. The SGSN/MME may reject or accept the UE request for enabling extended idle mode DRX. If the SGSN/MME accepts the extended idle mode DRX, the SGSN/MME based on operator policies and, if available, the extended idle mode DRX cycle length value in the subscription data from the HSS, may also provide different values of the extended idle mode DRX parameters than what was requested by the UE. If the SGSN/MME accepts the use of extended idle mode DRX, the UE applies extended idle mode DRX based on the received extended idle mode DRX parameters. If the UE does not receive extended idle mode DRX parameters in the relevant accept message because the SGSN/MME rejected its request or because the request was received by SGSN/MME not supporting extended idle mode DRX, the UE shall apply its regular discontinuous reception as defined in clause 5.13 of TS 23.401 [7].\nNOTE 2:\tThe extended idle mode DRX cycle length requested by UE takes into account requirements of applications running on the UE. Subscription based determination of eDRX cycle length can be used in those rare scenarios when applications on UE cannot be modified to request appropriate extended idle mode DRX cycle length. The network accepting extended DRX while providing an extended idle mode DRX cycle length value longer than the one requested by the UE, can adversely impact reachability requirements of applications running on the UE.\nThe specific negotiation procedure handling is described in TS 23.060 [6] and TS 23.401 [7].\nIf a UE requests via NAS both to enable PSM (requesting an active time and possibly a periodic TAU timer) and extended idle mode DRX (with a specific extended idle mode DRX cycle value), it is up to the SGSN/MME to decide whether to:\n1.\tEnable only PSM, i.e. not accept the request for extended idle mode DRX.\n2.\tEnable only extended idle mode DRX, i.e. not accept the request for an active time.\n3.\tEnable both PSM (i.e. provide an active time) and extended idle mode DRX (i.e. provide an extended idle mode DRX parameters).\nThe decision between the three above, and which active time, periodic TAU timer and/or extended idle mode DRX cycle value to provide to the UE, are implementation dependent, based on local configuration, and possibly other information available in the SGSN/MME. The method selected is then used until the next Attach or RAU/TAU procedure is initiated, when a new decision may be made. If both extended idle mode DRX and PSM are enabled, the extended idle mode DRX cycle should be set in order to have multiple paging occasions while the active timer is running.\nNOTE 3:\tTo maximize the power saving while in the extended idle mode DRX cycle, the Periodic TAU timer needs to be longer than the extended idle mode DRX cycle.\nIn the specific case when the PSM active time provided by the UE is greater than the extended idle mode DRX cycle value provided by the UE, the SGSN/MME may enable both PSM and extended idle mode DRX. This allows a UE to minimize power consumption during the active time e.g. when the active time is slightly longer than typical active time values for example in the order of several minutes.\nIf extended idle mode DRX is enabled, the network handles mobile terminated data using high latency communication feature, according to clause 4.5.7, GTP-C retransmissions as described in TS 23.060 [6] and TS 23.401 [7], and applies techniques to handle mobile terminated SMS according to TS 23.272 [11] and location services according to TS 23.271 [33].",

The TeDRX timer is set to the extended Idle mode DRX cycle value negotiated earlier on NAS level. At TeDRX expiry i.e. when the extended Idle mode DRX cycle elapses the UE monitors the network for paging using regular DRX parameters.\nCN and UE start the extended TeDRX timer at transmission and reception, respectively, of the Attach Accept or RAU Accept message where the relevant extended Idle mode DRX parameters are provided. In other words, Tref corresponds in the CN to the instant when RAU Accept message is sent and in the UE to the instant when the respective Accept message is received.\nThe TeDRX timer is maintained and used only when the Attach/RAU procedure was successfully executed and independent of UE's PMM state, i.e. transitions between Idle and Connected mode do not affect the TeDRX timer.\nIn order to improve paging reliability e.g. to avoid paging misses due to cell reselection or due to imperfect synchronization of the Tref parameter in the UE and the SGSN, a Paging Transmission Window Time (PTW) described by its duration TPTW is introduced. During PTW the UE monitors the network for paging when the extended Idle mode DRX cycle based on the extended Idle mode DRX value expires. During the PTW there may be multiple opportunities to page the UE which monitors the network for paging using regular DRX parameters.\nFigure 4.5.13.2-1 The usage of PTW and independence of the extended Idle mode DRX cycle from UE state\nIn reference to Figure 4.5.13.2-1, upon expiry of the TeDRX timer in the UE, the UE monitors the network for paging for TPTW seconds. TDRX is the duration of the regular DRX cycle.\nThe necessary information for applying the PTW is provided to the UE over NAS when extended Idle mode DRX is negotiated.\nIn the case of a paging trigger received in the CN for a UE in PMM Idle state, the CN forwards the paging message towards relevant RAN node(s) immediately if the paging trigger was received within the PTW. Otherwise the CN forwards the paging message shortly ahead of the beginning of the next PTW taking possible imperfections in the synchronization between the CN and the UE into account.",

      "content": "Functions for NIDD may be used to handle mobile originated (MO) and mobile terminated (MT) communication with UEs, where the data used for the communication is considered unstructured from the EPS standpoint (which we refer to also as Non-IP). The support of Non-IP data is part of the CIoT EPS optimizations. The Non-IP data delivery to SCS/AS is accomplished by one of two mechanisms:\n-\tDelivery using SCEF;\n-\tDelivery using a Point-to-Point (PtP) SGi tunnel.\nThe delivery using a Point-to-Point (PtP) SGi tunnel is further described in TS 23.401 [7].\nNIDD via the SCEF is handled using a PDN connection to the SCEF. The UE may obtain a Non-IP PDN connection to the SCEF either during the Attach procedure (see clause 5.3.2.1 of TS 23.401 [7]) or via UE requested PDN connectivity (see clause 5.10.2 of TS 23.401 [7]) or via PDP Context Activation Procedure (see clause 9.2.2.1 of TS 23.060 [6]).\nNOTE 1:\tThe UE is not made aware that a particular Non-IP PDN connection is provided via SCEF or via PGW. However, the network informs the UE whether a particular Non-IP PDN connection uses Control plane CIoT Optimization (see TS 23.401 [7]).\nAn association between the SCS/AS and a PDN Connection to the SCEF needs to be established to enable transfer of non-IP data between the UE and the SCS/AS. When the Reliable Data Service is not enabled, the SCEF determines the association based on provisioned policies that may be used to map an SCS/AS identity and User identity to an APN. When the Reliable Data Service is enabled, the SCEF determines the association based on port numbers and provisioned policies that may be used to map SCS/AS identities and User identity to an APN (see clause 4.5.14.3).\nNOTE 2:\tWhen more than one SCS/AS is associated with the same PDN Connection, it is permissible for packets to or from one port number to be associated with more than one SCS/AS. Also, any polices that are applied to the PDN Connection (e.g. APN Rate Control), apply to traffic from all of the SCS/AS's that are associated with the PDN Connection.\nNIDD via SCEF uses the User Identity, APN, and the SCS/AS identity to identify which UE a particular T6a/T6b connection belongs to. The User Identity is the user's IMSI. The user's IMSI shall not be used on the interface between SCEF and SCS/AS. In order to perform NIDD configuration or to send or receive NIDD data, the SCS/AS shall use MSISDN or External Identifier to identify the user. In order to facilitate correlation of SCS/AS requests to T6a/T6b connection for a given UE, the HSS provides to the SCEF (see NIDD Configuration procedure in clause 5.13.2) the user's IMSI, and if available, the MSISDN (when NIDD Configuration Request contains an External Identifier) or if available, External Identifier (when NIDD Configuration Request contains an MSISDN).\nDepending on operator configuration, the SCEF may perform buffering of MO and/or MT Non-IP data. In this release of specification, neither the MME/SGSN nor the IWK-SCEF are expecting to buffer data pertinent to PDN connection to the SCEF.\nThe Protocol Configuration Options (PCO) may be used to transfer parameters between the UE and SCEF (e.g. maximum packet size). The PCO's information shall be passed transparently through the MME/SGSN. As specified in TS 23.401 [7] and TS 23.060 [6], the PCO is sent in the EPS Session Management signalling between UE and MME and in GPRS Session Management signalling between UE and SGSN.\nThe SCEF applies rate control as described in clause 4.7.7 of TS 23.401 [7].",

      "content": "The Reliable Data Service may be used by the UE and SCEF or P-GW when using PDN Connection of PDN Type 'Non-IP'. The service provides a mechanism for the SCEF or P-GW to determine if the data was successfully delivered to the UE and for UE to determine if the data was successfully delivered to the SCEF. When a requested acknowledgement is not received, the Reliable Data Service retransmits the packet. The service is enabled or disabled based on APN Configuration per SLA.\nWhen the service is enabled, a protocol is used between the end-points of the Non-IP PDN Connection. The protocol uses a packet header to identify if the packet requires no acknowledgement, requires an acknowledgement, or is an acknowledgment and to allow detection and elimination of duplicate PDUs at the receiving endpoint. Reliable Data Service supports both single and multiple applications within the UE. Port Numbers in the header are used to identify the application on the originator and to identify the application on the receiver. The UE, the SCEF and the P-GW may support reservation of the source and the destination port numbers for their use and subsequent release of the reserved port numbers. Reliable Data Service protocol (as defined in TS 24.250 [47]) also enables applications to query their peer entities to determine which port numbers are reserved and which are available for use at any given time.\nDuring NIDD Configuration, the SCS/AS may indicate which serialization formats it supports for mobile originated and mobile terminated traffic in the Reliable Data Server Configuration. When port numbers are reserved by the UE, the serialization format that will be used by the application may be indicated to the SCEF. When port numbers are reserved by the SCEF, the serialization format that will be used by the application may be indicated to the UE. If the receiver does not support the indicated serialization format, it rejects the port number reservation request and the sender may re-attempt to reserve the port number with a different serialization format. If, during NIDD Configuration, the SCS/AS indicated that it supports multiple serialization formats, the SCEF determines the serialization format that it will indicate to the UE based on local policies and previous negotiations with the UE (e.g. the SCEF may indicate the same serialization format that was indicated by the UE or avoid indicating a serialization format that was previously rejected by the UE). When serialization formats are configured for reserved port numbers, the SCEF stores the serialization formats as part of the Reliable Data Service Configuration and provides the updated Reliable Data Service Configuration to the SCS/AS.\nNOTE:\tWhether the UE Application or SCS/AS supports a given serialization format is outside the scope of 3GPP specifications.\nThe UE indicates its capability of supporting Reliable Data Service in the Protocol Configuration Options (PCO) to the SCEF or P-GW. If SCEF or P-GW supports and accepts Reliable Data Service then it indicates to the UE, in the PCO, that the Reliable Data Service shall be used if enabled in the APN configuration.\nIn order to prevent situations where a Reliable Data Service instance needs to interface to both the user and control plane, the Reliable Data Service may only be used with PDN connections for which the \"Control Plane Only\" indicator is set or with PDN connections using the Control Plane EPS CIoT Optimization when the MME does not move PDN connections to the user plane.

However, for UEs using power saving functions, e.g. Power Saving Mode (defined in clause 4.5.4) or extended idle mode DRX (defined in clause 4.5.13), the UEs are usually unreachable for long periods of time. Moreover, different UEs are likely to be reachable at different times. Therefore, it is important that the time intervals the UE stays awake to receive MBMS user service or to discover if there is any MBMS user service scheduled for delivery, should not necessarily be the same as the reachable intervals negotiated for extended idle mode DRX or PSM.\nIf a UE becomes unreachable for unicast service due to either PSM or extended idle mode DRX, the UE may still perform MBMS specific procedures, e.g. activation/deactivation of the MBMS bearer service, MBMS data transfer reception, reception of service announcement (if needed), as defined in TS 23.246 [29] and TS 26.346 [38].\nFor those intervals the UE needs to be awake for MBMS bearer service, the following cases can be identified:\n1.\tWhen the UE's need to be awake due to MBMS coincides with the UE already being in connected mode due to other reasons, the UE follows normal connected mode procedures.\n2.\tWhen the UE's need to be awake due to MBMS coincides with the UE already being in idle mode and reachable (e.g. in active time for PSM or PTW for eDRX) the UE follows normal idle mode procedure.\n3.\tWhen the UE's need to be awake due to MBMS coincides with the UE being in idle mode and in deep sleep, i.e. unreachable for paging to the network, the UE leaves the deep sleep state only to perform procedures related to MBMS service.\n-\tIf the MBMS user service does not require the UE to transition to connected mode, i.e. the UE receives MBMS user service in idle mode, then the UE does not update the MME to become reachable for paging. The UE would therefore still be considered unreachable for paging in the MME. This minimizes the signalling between the UE and the network.\n-\tIf the MBMS user service requires the UE to transition to connected mode (e.g. for HTTP reception reporting, file repair, etc.) then the UE performs regular procedures for ECM connected mode. This would therefore make the UE become reachable in the network for other unicast services.\n4.\tWhen the UE is in the middle of an MBMS data transfer, and the UE is scheduled to move to deep sleep due to power saving, e.g. end of PTW for extended idle mode DRX or expiration of active time for PSM, then the UE does not go to deep sleep during the remainder of the current MBMS data transfer.\nNOTE 1:\tIf at the end of the current MBMS data transfer, the UE knows there is another MBMS data transfer scheduled soon, in that case depending of the time between MBMS data transfers, the UE can decide to go to sleep between MBMS data transfers.\nThere are two possible ways the UE can be notified of an upcoming MBMS broadcast session start:\n1.\tIf MBMS User Services defined in TS 26.346 [38] is used, the UE needs to receive MBMS service announcement while awake (i.e. while in connected mode, or while idle mode during PTW for extended idle mode DRX, or active time for PSM). The UE wakes up if not already awake for MBMS service reception based on the schedule received in the service announcement. For this option, the MBMS service announcement may be provided via MBMS broadcast service announcement or via any of the possible unicast service announcement delivery mechanisms defined in TS 23.246 [29]. If MBMS access via the MB2 interface as defined in TS 23.468 [30] is used, similar mechanisms need to be provided by the application layer using unicast mechanisms.\nNOTE 2:\tIn order to allow all UEs using power saving function to receive the service announcement in time to be able to receive the MBMS broadcast data delivery, the application server needs to be aware of the maximum unreachable period of the UEs.\n2.\tThe UE may be configured by the application server with specific times to perform MBMS procedures, and wakes up from deep-sleep if needed at those times. The UE may also receive MBMS service announcements and/or MBMS broadcast delivery at those times (if needed).\nNOTE 3:\tThe configuration (e.g. TMGI, start time) is out of scope of 3GPP and assumed to be performed between application server and UE at application layer. The application server needs to initiate MBMS bearer service procedures during those time intervals.",

In order to support Location Services for CIoT UEs, following enhancements to Location Services are defined (refer to TS 23.271 [33] for detailed procedures):\n-\tDeferred location for the UE availability event:\n-\tWhen extended idle mode DRX or PSM is used, a deferred location request for UE available event allows an LCS Client to obtain the UE location as soon as the UE becomes available.\nNOTE:\tWithout deferred location for UE available event, an LCS Client can configure a Monitoring Event for UE Reachability and issue a Mobile Terminated Location Request (MT-LR) when the UE reachability is reported, but this will fail if the UE becomes unreachable again before the MT-LR is performed.\n-\tThe procedures for deferred location from V-GMLC to the external client and the EPC Mobile Terminating Location Request (EPC-MT-LR) procedure are combined properly in the V-GMLC as specified TS 23.271 [33].\n-\tIndication of UE RAT type and/or coverage level to Evolved Serving Mobile Location Centre (E-SMLC):\n-\tProviding an E-SMLC with an indication of the RAT type and/or the coverage level may enable the E-SMLC to appropriately determine a maximum size, maximum frequency and maximum transfer delay for positioning messages sent to and from the UE.\n-\tRAT type and coverage level indications from the MME to the E-SMLC are introduced in TS 23.271 [33].\n-\tFor the case of coverage level, and indication of coverage level from eNB to MME is introduced.\n-\tSupport of UE positioning measurements in idle mode:\n-\tNB-IoT UEs or Cat-M1 UEs may perform measurements for some positioning methods only when in ECM-IDLE state due to minimal resources.\n-\tAn E-SMLC that is aware of this (e.g. from an indication sent by the UE) may allow additional response time to the UE (e.g. in the QoS) to obtain the measurements. An MME that is aware of this (e.g. from the UE access type) may also allow additional time for a location session to complete.\n-\tAddition of Periodic and Triggered Location for EPC:\n-\tA flexible periodic and/or triggered Mobile Terminated Location Request (MT-LR) capability is useful to enable UE location at times other than when a UE normally becomes available and/or with better granularity than a cell ID.\n-\tNew procedures are introduced in TS 23.271 [33] to initiate and maintain deferred periodic and triggered event reporting and to cancel reporting by an LCS client, UE or network entity. The area event, periodic event and motion event are clarified in the context of EPC access. Impacts to LCS messages between an LCS Client and GMLC, between GMLCs and between an H-GMLC and PPR are included.\n-\tSupport of Last Known Location for a UE that are unreachable for long periods of times:\n-\tFor UEs that are unreachable for long periods of time, e.g. using extended idle mode DRX or PSM, last known location support enables an external LCS client to receive some information on UE location without waiting (e.g. a few hours) for the UE to become reachable.\n-\tThe EPC-MT-LR procedure defined in TS 23.271 [33] is enhanced to support last known location based on a last known serving cell.",

In order for UEs of these categories to be able to receive MBMS service, E-UTRAN needs to be able to determine the UE category that applies to the specific service indicated by the TMGI.\nIn order for E-UTRAN to know the UE categories for MBMS bearer service, the UE Capability for MBMS (which includes UE Category for MBMS and optionally associated coverage level for MBMS) is provided by SCS/AS to the BMSC via the SCEF. Using PLMN specific QCI information, the characteristics are signalled by the BM-SC to E-UTRAN following the procedures described in clause 5.5.1 of the present specification and TS 23.246 [29].

E-UTRAN uses the QCI to determine the radio parameters that would determine the categories of UEs that are required to receive the service. EUTRAN is configured with the QCI to UE Category for MBMS mapping.\nNOTE 1:\tThe way UE Category for MBMS needs to be interpreted is to allow PLMN specific QCI to be derived by the BMSC that would allow the MBMS service to be received by each UE type. For example, for UE Category for MBMS \"M1 and M2\", a QCI will be derived that will map to radio configuration that would allow M1 and M2 UEs to receive the service over the radio interface. For UE Category Info \"NB2\", a QCI will be derived that will map to radio configuration that would allow only NB2 UEs to receive the service over the radio interface.\n-\tOptionally, the SCS/AS may provide additional information regarding the coverage level for the related MBMS service. The coverage level indicates if the MBMS service is intended to be received by UEs located in extended coverage and is used by E-UTRAN to determine the radio configuration required, e.g. determine the number of repetitions, to reach the UEs that receive the MBMS service. Three levels of Coverage Level for MBMS are defined as \"normal\", \"medium\" and \"high\". The coverage level information, when provided, shall be reflected via the QCI.\nNOTE 2:\tIt is up to E-UTRAN implementation how the coverage level information can be used.\nNOTE 3:\tA single QCI does not allow for both NB and M category UEs to receive the same service indicated by one TMGI.",

      "content": "Figure 5.2.3.1-1: Device trigger recall/replace procedure over Tsp\n1.\tThe SCS determines it needs to recall/replace a trigger message that it has previously submitted. The SCS sends Device Action Request (External Identifier or MSISDN, SCS Identifier, old trigger reference number, new trigger reference number, validity period, priority, Application Port ID and trigger payload) message with action type set to \"Trigger Recall Request\" or \"Trigger Replace Request\". The SCS needs to include new trigger reference number, validity period, priority, Application Port ID and trigger payload for trigger replace request only. The old trigger reference number indicates the trigger reference number which was assigned to the previously submitted trigger message that the SCS wants to cancel. The new trigger reference number is assigned by the SCS to the newly submitted trigger message.\nIf the SCS is not authorized to perform device triggering or the SCS has exceeded its quota or rate of trigger submission over Tsp, the MTC-IWF rejects the Device Action Request message with action type set to \"Trigger Recall Request\" or \"Trigger Replace Request\" by sending a Device Action Answer message with a cause value indicating the reason for the failure condition, and the flow stops at this step.\nNOTE 1:\tThe validity period in a trigger replace request needs to be greater than zero for the MTC-IWF to attempt its delivery.\n2.\tThe MTC-IWF sends a Subscriber Information Request (External Identifier or MSISDN and SCS Identifier) message to the HSS/HLR to determine if SCS is authorized to perform device triggering to the UE. This message is also to resolve the External Identifier or MSISDN to IMSI and retrieve the related HSS stored \"Routing information\" including the identities of the UE's serving CN node(s) which are needed for trigger replace request only.\nNOTE 2:\tOptionally, mapping from External Identifiers to MSISDN is also provided for legacy SMS infrastructure not supporting MSISDN-less SMS.\n3.\tThe HSS/HLR sends the Subscriber Information Response (IMSI and/or MSISDN and related \"Routing information\" including the serving node(s) identities, cause) message. The IMSI and/or MSISDN and related \"Routing information\" including the serving node(s) identities in the Subscriber Information Response message is only needed for trigger replace request and not used by MTC-IWF for trigger recall request. HSS/HLR policy (possibly dependent on the VPLMN ID) may influence which serving node identities are returned. If the cause value indicates the SCS is not allowed to perform device triggering to this UE, or there is no valid subscription information, the MTC-IWF sends a Device Action Answer message with a cause value indicating the reason for the failure condition and the flow stops at this step. Otherwise this flow continues with step 4.\n4.\tIf trigger message which should be recalled or replaced was submitted to a SMS-SC as defined in clause 5.2.2, T4 device trigger replace procedure according to clause 5.2.3.2 or T4 device trigger recall procedure according to clause 5.2.3.3 is performed.\n5.\tThe MTC-IWF indicates trigger recall/replace success or failure in Device Action Answer message to the SCS.

The SCS/AS may determine the IP address(es)/port(s) of the SCEF by performing a DNS query using the External Group Identifier or using a locally configured SCEF identifier/address. The location information restricts the distribution of the group message. It takes the format indicated in Accuracy parameter which can be either a list of cell IDs, or a list of MBMS Service Areas, or civic addresses, or a geographic area, or a combination of any of the above. Using the location information, the SCEF checks whether the SCS/AS is authorized to request TMGI allocation.\nIf the expiration time for a previously allocated TMGI is to be extended, in addition to External Group ID, SCS Identifier and location/area information, the previously allocated TMGI is included in the Allocate TMGI Request message.\nNOTE 2:\tA single SCEF can be connected to multiple BM-SCs in a given PLMN. The location information is used to identify BM-SC(s) to which MB2-C/U messages are to be sent to.\n2.\tThe SCEF determines whether the SCS/AS is authorized to request TMGI allocation.\n3.\tThe SCEF initiates TMGI allocation by the BM-SC (see TMGI Allocation Procedure specified in TS 23.468 [30]). In this procedure, if the TMGI is not included in step 1, the SCEF requests allocation of only one TMGI. If a TMGI is included in step 1, the SCEF requests to extend the TMGI expiration time for that TMGI. The SCEF stores TMGI and TMGI expiration received in this step.\n4.\tThe SCEF sends Allocate TMGI Response (Cause, TMGI, TMGI expiration) message to the SCS/AS. Cause value indicates success or failure of the requested procedure. In the case of failure, the reason for the failure condition is also included. The TMGI allocated by the BM-SC to which the SCS/AS is expected to send the group message, and TMGI expiration indicating the expiration time for the TMGI are also included.\nNOTE 3:\tThe SCEF may cache the serving BM-SC Identity information and mapping between External Group ID and TMGI.\nSteps 5 to 14 are skipped if the SCS/AS only wants to extend the expiration time of the TMGI (MB2 only).\n5.\tApplication level interactions may be applied for the UEs of specific group to retrieve the related MBMS service information, e.g. TMGI, start time, etc. in the case of MB2. Application level interactions between the UE and the SCS/AS are out of scope of this specification.\nIf xMB is used, steps 1 to 5 are skipped.\n6.\tThe SCS/AS sends the Group Message Request (External Group Identifier, SCS Identifier, TMGI (MB2 only), Message Delivery Stop Time (xMB only), optional (Group Message Payload, location information, Accuracy, Message Delivery Start Time) message to the SCEF.\nIn the case of xMB, the SCEF creates a service using xMB for the group message and associates the external Group Identifier with the HTTP REST resource identifier of the service provided by the BM-SC upon service creation. The then SCEF forwards either only the ServiceID (see Table 5.4-1 in TS 26.348 [46]) to the SCS/AS or all service announcement. After the service is created, the SCS/AS triggers session creation towards the SCEF.\nThe SCEF assigns a TLTRI that identifies this group message delivery request. The location information is included to identify the location over which group message is to be sent. It takes the format indicated in Accuracy parameter which can be either a list of cell IDs, or a list of MBMS Service Areas, or civic addresses, or a geographic area, or a combination of any of the above.\nThe Message Delivery Start Time indicates the time at which the group message is to be sent by the network on the MBMS bearer(s). If not included, the group message is expected to be sent immediately. The Message Delivery Stop Time indicates the time at which the group message delivery is expected to be completed. When included, Group Message Payload indicates the payload the SCS/AS intends to deliver to UEs. Absence of Group Message Payload is indicative of the SCS/AS using delivery of group message in step 13a.\nNOTE 4:\tA single Group Message Payload can be sent to all included TMGIs (MB2 only).\nNOTE 5:\tWhether actual payload or a reference to the payload (e.g. URI) is sent in this step is left to Stage 3. In the case of the latter, the SCEF downloads the payload prior to step 13.\nIn the case of xMB, if the application in the UE receives a ServiceId through application level interaction, the application can activate reception using MBMS APIs (see TS 26.347 [42]).\n7.\tThe SCEF checks that the SCS/AS is authorised to send a group message request. It also checks to see if Message Delivery Start Time doesn't start after the TMGI expiration (MB2 only). In the case of xMB, the SCEF ensures that the xMB session stop time is not before the Message Delivery Start Time. If either of the checks fail, then the SCEF executes step 11 with a cause value indicating the reason for the failure condition and the flow stops at this step. In this case, the SCS/AS may subsequently release the TMGI allocated at step 3 by requesting an explicit de-allocation, or may rely on the expiration timer.\n8.\tIf MB2 is used, the Activate MBMS Bearer Procedure (see clause 5.1.2.3.2 of TS 23.468 [30]) is executed with the following changes:\n-\tIn step 1 of this procedure, the SCEF, acting as GCS AS, may include location information from step 6. If no location information is provided in step 6 of this procedure, then the SCEF, based on local configuration, uses either a list of MBMS Service Area Identities, or a list of cell IDs, or both as the MBMS broadcast area.\n-\tIn step 2 of this procedure, the BM-SC may map the civic address(es) (if provided) and/or geographic area(s) (if provided) of location information into MBMS Service Area Identities subject to operator policies.\n8a-8c. If xMB is used, the Create Session procedure (see clause 5.4.2 of TS 26.348 [46]), Get Session Properties (see clause 5.4.3 of TS 26.348 [46]) and the Update Session Procedure (see clause 5.4.4 of TS 26.348 [46]) is executed with the following changes and clarification:\n-\tSCEF acts as a Content Provider.\n-\tAfter completion of the Get Session Properties procedure, the Session Type value is set to \"Files\" by the SCEF irrespective of the received value for this parameter.\n-\tIn step 1 of Update Session procedure, the SCEF may include location information from step 6, session start and session stop. If no location information is provided in step 6 of this procedure, then the SCEF, based on local configuration, uses either a list of MBMS Service Area Identities, or a list of cell IDs, or both as the MBMS broadcast area. The SCEF shall derive the session start based on the Message Delivery Start Time if provided in step 6 and the session stop based on the Message Delivery Stop Time if provided in step 6. Session Resource ID as defined in TS 26.348 [46] Create Session response sent by the BM-SC to SCEF uniquely identifies an MBMS session during which MBMS service data is sent. Given that an MBMS session can target a certain MBMS Service Area via a TMGI and an MBMS Service Area description, it can be mapped to a specific group (i.e., MBMS UEs belonging to that group and which have received MBMS service announcement information containing the TMGI of the MBMS bearer service associated with this MBMS session can activate reception for that session).\n-\tIn step 2 of Update Session procedure, the BM-SC may map the civic address(es) (if provided) and/or geographic area(s) (if provided) of location information into MBMS Service Area Identities subject to operator policies.\nIn the case of xMB, depending on the service created, the BM-SC may send the service announcement information to the UE as specified in TS 26.348 [46]. The service announcement information is referenced by the ServiceId which was provided by the BM-SC to the SCEF and then forwarded to the SCS/AS for service identification.\n9.\tVoid.\n10.\tVoid.\n11.\tThe SCEF sends a Group Message Response (TLTRI, TMGI (MB2 only), Acceptance Status, (optional) SCEF Message Delivery IP address/port) message to the SCS/AS to indicate whether the Request has been accepted for delivery to the group. The SCEF sends Acceptance Status of TMGI to indicate whether activation of MBMS bearer corresponding to the TMGI was accepted or rejected. If Group Message Payload was not included in step 6, then the SCEF also sends SCEF Message Delivery IP address and port number to the SCS/AS.\nNOTE 6:\tThe SCEF can map BM-SC address and port number (received in step 8 for MB2 or xMB delivery) to a different IP address and port number to be used between the SCEF and the SCS/AS for delivery of group message payload.\n12.\tApplication level interactions may be applied for the UEs of specific group to retrieve the related MBMS service information, e.g. TMGI, start time. Application level interactions between the UE and the SCS/AS are out of scope of this specification. When using xMB, the application may receive the appropriate information through MBMS APIs from the MBMS Client (see TS 26.347 [42]).\n13a.\tIf Group Message Payload was included in step 6, then at Message Delivery Start Time, the SCEF delivers to BM-SC the Group Message Payload(s) to corresponding to the MB2-U or the xMB-U IP address and port number associated with respective TMGI. If Group Message Payload was not included in step 6, then at or after the requested Group Message Start Time, but before the TMGI Expiration time (if MB2 is used) or Message Delivery Stop Time (if xMB is used), the SCS/AS transfers the content to be delivered to the group to the SCEF using the SCEF Message Delivery IP address and port number received at step 11, and then the SCEF delivers the content to the BM-SC. The BM-SC transfers the corresponding content to UEs. The SCS/AS may repeat Step 13a unless the Message Delivery Stop Time is reached. To avoid that potential responses to the broadcast message by high numbers of UEs are sent at almost the same time, it is recommended that the SCS/AS provide the UEs with a response time window if it expects the UEs to respond to the delivered content.\nNOTE 7:\tSubsequent to this step, it is up to the SCS/AS if the MBMS bearers will be kept active and allocated and for how long. The mechanisms defined in TS 23.468 [30] or TS 26.348 [46] can be used by the SCEF to release the MBMS resources.\n13b.\tUpon execution of 13a, the SCEF sends a Group Message Delivery (TLTRI, TMGI, Delivery Trigger Status) message to the SCS/AS to indicate whether group message delivery was triggered successful. TLTRI refers to the transaction identified by TLTRI in step 6. For the TMGI, the SCEF sends Delivery Trigger Status to indicate whether delivery of Group Message Payload corresponding to the TMGI was successful or not.\n14.\tWhen a UE receives the Group Message Payload it may initiate immediate or later communication with the SCS/AS.\nNOTE 8:\tIt is recommended that the UE application ensures distribution of any responses within the response time window.",

When the application receives a ServiceId through application level interaction, the application can activate reception using MBMS APIs (see TS 26.347 [42]). Application level interactions between the UE and the SCS/AS are out of scope of this specification.\n2.\tThe SCS/AS determines that modification of previously accepted Group Message Delivery Request is required. The SCS/AS sends the Modify Group Message Request (TLTRI, Requested Action, Message Delivery Start Time, Message Delivery Stop Time (xMB only), optional (External Group Identifier, SCS Identifier, TMGI (MB2 only), Group Message Payload, location information, Accuracy) message to the SCEF. In the case of xMB, the SCEF identifies the associated MBMS Service using the external Group Identifier. Requested Action is either set to \"Modify\", or \"Cancel\". \"Modify\" indicates the request is to modify the transaction identified by TLTRI. \"Cancel\" indicates the request is to cancel the transaction identified by TLTRI. When set to \"Modify\", then the remainder parameters, except Message Delivery Start Time, are optional, and included only if different to that of step 6 from clause 5.5.1.

If no location information is provided in step 2 of this procedure, then the SCEF, based on local configuration, uses either a list of MBMS Service Area Identities, or a list of cell IDs, or both as the MBMS broadcast area.\n-\tIn step 2 of this procedure, the BM-SC may map the civic address(es) (if provided) and/or geographic area(s) (if provided) of location information into MBMS Service Area Identities subject to operator policies.\n5.\tIf Requested Action was set to \"Cancel\", then the SCEF sends a Modify Group Message Response (Cause) message to the SCS/AS with appropriate Cause value depending on whether the cancellation was accepted, and the flow stops at this step. If Requested Action was set to \"Modify\", then the SCEF sends a Modify Group Message Response (Cause, TMGI, Acceptance Status) message to the SCS/AS to indicate whether the requested modifications were accepted. The usage of parameters is similar to step 11 of clause 5.5.1.\n6.\tSteps 12-14 of clause 5.5.1 are executed.",

The SCS/AS may determine the IP address(es)/port(s) of the SCEF by performing a DNS query using the External Group Identifier or using a locally configured SCEF identifier/address. When non-IP data is sent to an External Group Identifier, the Reliable Data Service Configuration shall indicate that no reliable data service acknowledgment is requested.\nThe Maximum Latency Parameter provided by the SCS/AS in this procedure is only used by the SCEF to determine the maximum acceptable delay for associated non-IP data and is not propagated further by the SCEF.\n2.\tBased on the preceding NIDD Configuration of the UE Group (see clause 5.13.2) and the SCEF stored list of authorized External Identifiers associated to the External Group Identifier, the SCEF sends a single Group MT NIDD Submit Response (Cause) message to the SCS/AS to acknowledge acceptance of the Group MT NIDD Submit Request. The Cause may indicate that the non-IP packet size is larger than the Maximum Packet Size determined in the preceding NIDD configuration of the UE Group.\n3.\tThe SCEF performs this step for each External Identifier that belongs to the External Group Identifier. The SCEF stored the list of authorized External Identifiers associated to the External Group Identifier during the preceding NIDD Configuration of the UE Group (see clause 5.13.2). The SCEF determines the EPS Bearer Context based on the NIDD Configuration TLTRI that is associated with the SCS/AS Identifier and the External Identifier. If an SCEF EPS bearer context corresponding to the External Identifier and SCS/AS Identifier is found, then the SCEF checks whether the SCS/AS is authorised to send NIDD requests and that the SCS/AS has not exceeded its rate control quota or rate of data submission to the SCEF EPS bearer. If this check fails, the SCEF does nothing in this step for this UE and the Cause value that is associated with this UE and provided to the SCS/AS in step 4 will indicate the reason for the failure condition for each failed UE. For each UE that passes these checks, the SCEF continues with the flow by executing steps 2-9 (except steps 2b and 5) of the Mobile Terminated NIDD Procedure of clause 5.13.3.\n4.\tAfter executing step 3 for all UEs, the SCEF sends an aggregated response message Group MT NIDD Submit Indication (TLTRI associated with the Request of step 1, Hop-by-Hop Acknowledgment Indication(s), Re-Transmission time(s), Trigger Indication(s), Cause(s)). The Re-Transmission time(s) report, for UEs that have power saving function and did not receive the MT NIDD message, how long time it will take before they are reachable. Re-Transmission time(s) are not sent for UEs where transmission was successful. The SCEF does not buffer the non-IP data further (if applicable) and provides a Hop-by-Hop Acknowledgment Indication, and a Cause value for each UE in the response to the SCS/AS. See clause 5.13.3 for a description of the Hop-by-Hop Acknowledgment Indication and when it is included. The Trigger Indication(s) is used to indicate UE(s) for which a trigger was sent in order to establish a PDN connection.\nNOTE:\tThe Re-Transmission time is used to inform the SCS/AS when the UE is expected to become reachable again, it is the expected wake up time that MME provided to SCEF when delivery failed for UEs with long sleep time.",

      "content": "This clause describes the common parameters required for Monitoring Event procedures.\nSCEF Reference ID is a parameter created by the SCEF to associate a Monitoring Event report or a deletion of a Monitoring Event to a specific Monitoring Request and the associated context information within the SCEF. SCEF Reference ID is stored by HSS, MME, SGSN, and IWK-SCEF.\nNOTE 1:\tFor the case of an individual UE, an SCEF may aggregate Monitoring Event configuration requests for the same External identifier/MSISDN from different SCS/AS instances.\nNOTE 2:\tFor the case of groups, an SCEF may aggregate Monitoring Event configuration requests for the same External Group Identifier from different SCS/AS instances.\nSCEF ID indicates the SCEF to which the Monitoring Indication message has to be sent to by the HSS, MME, SGSN, or IWK-SCEF. SCEF ID is stored by the HSS, MME, SGSN, and IWK-SCEF.\nSCEF Reference ID for Deletion identifies the monitoring event configuration that shall be deleted before applying the requested monitoring event configuration.\nMonitoring Type identifies the specific Monitoring Event being requested.\nIf the Monitoring Event Configuration requested from the SCEF is for a group of UEs, the HSS includes User Identity in the monitoring event configuration.\nMaximum Number of Reports is an optional parameter that indicates the maximum number of event reports to be generated by the HSS, MME, or SGSN until the associated monitoring event is considered to expire. This parameter can be used when configuring a monitoring event for an individual UE or a group. When the parameter is configured for a group, the configured value is applied to each individual UE's monitoring event configuration. A value of one implies a single event report is to be generated which makes it equivalent to a One-time Monitoring Request.\nMonitoring Duration is an optional parameter that indicates the absolute time at which the related monitoring event request is considered to expire. For Monitoring Requests for a group, this parameter applies to every group member UE.\nInclusion of either Maximum Number of Reports (with a value higher than one) or Monitoring Duration makes the Monitoring Request a Continuous Monitoring Request. For a Continuous Monitoring Request, a single Monitoring Request may generate more than one Monitoring Indication message. Support of continuous monitoring is optional.\nAbsence of both Maximum Number of Reports and Monitoring Duration makes the Monitoring Request a One-time Monitoring Request. For One-time Monitoring Requests, a single Monitoring Request generates only one Monitoring Report for an individual UE and for an individual group member UE.\nIf for a given Monitoring Event both Maximum Number of Reports and Monitoring Duration are included then the monitoring request is considered to expire as soon as one of the conditions is met.\nChargeable Party Identifier is an optional parameter included by the SCEF. It identifies the entity towards which accounting/charging functionality is performed by the involved 3GPP network elements.\nMTC Provider Information is an optional parameter included by the SCEF. It identifies the MTC Service Provider and/or MTC Application. Optionally the MTC Provider Information may also be provided by the SCS/AS.\nGroup Reporting Guard Time is an optional parameter for group-based monitoring configuration to indicate the time for which the Monitoring Event Reporting(s) detected by the UEs in a group can be aggregated before sending them to the SCEF/SCS/AS. The value of the Group Reporting Guard time should be set less than the Monitoring Duration. For the continuous monitoring reporting, unless the Monitoring Duration has been reached, the Group Reporting Guard timer is restarted when it expires. If the time left until Monitoring Duration is less than the Group Reporting Guard Time, then the Group Reporting Guard timer shall be set to expire when the Monitoring Duration expires. If the Monitoring Duration is expired, the Group Reporting Guard Time, if running, shall be considered to expire and aggregated Monitoring Event Reporting(s) is sent to destination immediately.\nNumber of UEs is a parameter that is provided to the SCEF during group-based monitoring configuration to indicate the number of UEs within the group identified by the External Group Identifier. The SCEF uses this value to determine whether the monitoring event has been reported for all group member UEs.",

      "section_title": "Configuration Procedure",
      "content": "Figure 5.6.1.1-1 illustrates the procedure of configuring monitoring at the HSS or the MME/SGSN. The procedure is common for various Monitoring Event types. Common parameters for this procedure are detailed in clause 5.6.0. The steps and parameters specific to different Monitoring Event types are detailed in clauses 5.6.1.3 to 5.6.1.9.\nThe procedure is also used for deleting a previously configured Monitoring Event either as a standalone procedure or together with configuring a new Monitoring Event between the same SCEF and the same SCS/AS, or replacing a previously configured Monitoring Event with a new Monitoring Event of the same type between the same SCEF and the same SCS/AS, or for one-time reporting if the Configured Monitoring Event is available at the configured node or cancelling the event monitoring for certain UEs (i.e. one individual UE or a sub-set of UEs) in a group of UEs for which there is a configured Monitoring Event or adding the event monitoring for certain new UEs (i.e. one individual UE or a sub-set of UEs) in a group of UEs for which there is a configured Monitoring Event.\nFigure 5.6.1.1-1: Monitoring event configuration and deletion via HSS procedure\n1.\tThe SCS/AS sends a Monitoring Request (External Identifier or MSISDN or External Group ID, SCS/AS Identifier, Monitoring Type, Maximum Number of Reports, Monitoring Duration, T8 Destination Address, TLTRI for Deletion, TLTRI for Update, the External Identifier(s) or MSISDN(s) of the individual member UE(s) to be cancelled or added for an existing group event, operation indication (cancellation or addition), Group Reporting Guard Time, MTC Provider Information) message to the SCEF. The SCEF assigns a TLTRI that identifies the Monitoring Request, if a new monitoring event is being configured. The SCS/AS may perform deletion of a previously configured Monitoring Event together with configuring a new Monitoring Event. If the SCS/AS wants to perform deletion of a previously configured Monitoring Event, then it shall include TLTRI for Deletion.\nIf the SCS/AS wants to configure Monitoring Event for the group of UEs, the SCS/AS can send Monitoring Request message including External Group Identifier and Group Reporting Guard Time. If the SCS/AS includes External Group Identifier in the Monitoring Request message, External Identifier or MSISDN shall be ignored. A Group Reporting Guard Time is an optional parameter to indicate that aggregated Monitoring Event Reporting(s) which have been detected for the UEs in a group needs to be sent to the SCS/AS once the Group Reporting Guard Time is expired.\nIf the SCS/AS decides to cancel or add the monitoring event for certain UEs (i.e. one individual UE or a sub-set of UEs) in a group of UEs for which there is a configured Monitoring Event, the SCS/AS can send Monitoring Request message including the TLTRI for Update corresponding to the existing monitoring event configuration and the External Identifier(s) or MSISDN(s) of the individual member UE(s) to be cancelled or added with the operation indication which is either cancellation or addition.\nNOTE 1:\tA relative priority scheme for the treatment of multiple SCS/AS Monitoring Requests, e.g. for deciding which requests to serve under overload condition, can be applied. This priority scheme is used locally by the SCEF, i.e. it is not used nor translated in procedures towards other functions.\n2.\tThe SCEF stores SCS/AS Identifier, T8 Destination Address, Monitoring Duration, Maximum Number of Reports and Group Reporting Guard Time, if provided. If the SCEF assigned a TLTRI, the SCEF stores the TLTRI, and also assigns it to an SCEF Reference ID. Based on operator policies, if either the SCS/AS is not authorized to perform this request (e.g. if the SLA does not allow for it) or the Monitoring Request is malformed or the SCS/AS has exceeded its quota or rate of submitting monitoring requests, the SCEF performs step 9 and provides a Cause value appropriately indicating the error. If the SCEF received a TLTRI for Update, the SCEF looks up the SCEF context pointed to by the TLTRI for Update to derive the related SCEF Reference ID. If the SCEF received a TLTRI for Deletion, the SCEF looks up the SCEF context pointed to by the TLTRI for Deletion to derive the related SCEF Reference ID for Deletion.\nIf the SCEF received a request to cancel the monitoring event for indicated UEs (i.e. one individual UE or a sub-set of UEs) in a group of UEs for which there is a configured Monitoring Event and if the Maximum Number of Reports applies to the monitoring event configuration, the SCEF sets the stored number of reports of the indicated UE(s) to Maximum Number of Reports.\nThe SCEF uses the Group Reporting Guard Time for a Monitoring Event Reporting for the group of UEs when the Monitoring Indication message is sent from the MME/SGSN to the SCEF. The SCEF sets the Group Reporting Guard Time for HSS less than the value for the SCEF received from SCS/AS in order to ensure to receive accumulated Monitoring Indication from HSS before the Group Reporting Guard Timer for SCEF is expired.\n3.\tThe SCEF sends a Monitoring Request (External Identifier or MSISDN or External Group Identifier, SCEF ID, SCEF Reference ID, Monitoring Type, Maximum Number of Reports, Monitoring Duration, SCEF Reference ID for Deletion, the External Identifier(s) or MSISDN(s) of the individual member UE(s) to be cancelled or added, operation indication (cancellation or addition), Chargeable Party Identifier, Group Reporting Guard Time, MTC Provider Information) message to the HSS to configure the given Monitoring Event on the HSS and on the MME/SGSN, if required. If the External Group Identifier is included, External Identifier or MSISDN shall be ignored. For one-time Monitoring Request of Roaming Status, the SCEF does not indicate the Group Reporting Guard Time.\nNOTE 2:\tThe MTC Provider Information in step 1 is an optional parameter. The SCEF should validate the provided MTC Provider Information and may override it to an SCEF selected MTC Provider Information based on configuration. How the SCEF determines the MTC Provider Information if not present in step 1 is left to implementation (e.g. based on the requesting SCS/AS).\n4. The HSS examines the Monitoring Request message, e.g. with regard to the existence of External Identifier or MSISDN or External Group Identifier, whether any included parameters are in the range acceptable for the operator, whether the monitoring event(s) is supported by the serving MME/SGSN, whether the group-basis monitoring event feature is supported by the serving MME/SGSN, or whether the monitoring event that shall be deleted or updated is valid. The HSS optionally authorizes the chargeable party identified by Chargeable Party Identifier. If this check fails the HSS follows step 8 and provides a Cause value indicating the reason for the failure condition to the SCEF.\nNOTE 3:\tThe details of the chargeable party authorization are outside the scope of this specification.\nThe HSS stores the SCEF Reference ID, the SCEF ID, Maximum Number of Reports, Monitoring Duration and the SCEF Reference ID for Deletion as provided by the SCEF. For a Monitoring Request for a group, such parameters are stored for every group member UE. For a Monitoring Request with the External Identifier(s) or MSISDN(s) of the individual member UE(s) to be cancelled or added as in step 3, such parameters together with the operation indication as provided by the SCEF are stored for every indicated UE.\nThe HSS uses the Group Reporting Guard Time for a Monitoring Event Reporting for the group of UEs when the Monitoring Indication message is sent from the HSS to the SCEF.\n4a.\tFor group based processing, if the HSS receives the Monitoring Request with an External Group Identifier, the HSS sends a Monitoring Response (SCEF Reference ID, Number of UEs, Cause) message to the SCEF to acknowledge acceptance of the Monitoring Request immediately before beginning the processing of individual UEs indicating that Group processing is in progress. The HSS deletes the monitoring event configuration identified by the SCEF Reference ID, if it was requested.\nIf the HSS receives the Monitoring Request with the External Identifier(s) or MSISDN(s) of the individual member UE(s) to be cancelled or added as in step 3 and the event was monitored by the HSS, the HSS cancels or adds the event monitoring for the indicated UE(s).\n4b.\tThe SCEF sends a Monitoring Response (TLTRI, Cause) message to the SCS/AS. The Cause value indicates progress of Group processing request.\n5.\tIf required by the specific Monitoring Type and when Monitoring Event(s) is supported by the serving MME/SGSN, the HSS sends an Insert Subscriber Data Request (Monitoring Type, SCEF ID, SCEF Reference ID, Maximum Number of Reports, Monitoring Duration, SCEF Reference ID for Deletion, Chargeable Party Identifier) message to the MME/SGSN for each individual UE and for each individual group member UE. If the Monitoring Request message is for a group of UEs, for each UE group member, the HSS includes the selected External ID or the MSISDN in the monitoring event configuration and sends an Insert Subscriber Data Request message per UE to all the MME/SGSN(s) serving the members of the group. If the HSS has received in step 3 Monitoring Request with the External Identifier(s) or MSISDN(s) of the individual member UE(s) to be added, for each indicated UE group member, the HSS includes the corresponding External ID or the MSISDN in the monitoring event configuration and sends an Insert Subscriber Data Request message to the MME/SGSN(s) serving such indicated UE group member. If the HSS has received in step 3 Monitoring Request with the External Identifier(s) or MSISDN(s) of the individual member UE(s) to be cancelled and the event is monitored by MME/SGSN, the HSS includes the received value of the SCEF Reference ID within the SCEF Reference ID for Deletion towards to the MME/SGSN. Optionally, the HSS allocates a Provider-Group-ID based on the MTC Provider Information (different from the IMSI-Group-Id) and sends it to the MME/SGSN to assist the serving node(s) when selecting and differentiating configurations for a given MTC Service Provider (e.g. to delete the configurations for a specific MTC Service Provider at the MME/SGSN).\nNOTE 4:\tHow the HSS selects an External ID when multiple External IDs are associated with the same IMSI is left to implementation, e.g. based on the MTC Provider Information (if received) or the default External ID (if not received)\nNOTE 5:\tThe Provider-Group-ID is used for group operations e.g. as specified in clause 4.3.7.4.2 of TS 23.401 [7] NAS level congestion control.\n6.\tIf the MME/SGSN is configured to use an IWK-SCEF for the PLMN of the SCEF then clause 5.6.6 applies. Otherwise, the MME/SGSN verifies the request, e.g. if the Monitoring Type is covered by a roaming agreement when the request is from another PLMN or whether it serves the SCEF Reference ID for Deletion and can delete it. If this check fails, the MME/SGSN follows step 7 and provides a Cause value indicating the reason for the failure condition to the HSS. Based on operator policies, the MME/SGSN may also reject the request due to other reasons (e.g. overload or HSS has exceeded its quota or rate of submitting monitoring requests defined by an SLA).\nThe MME/SGSN stores the received parameters and starts to watch for the indicated Monitoring Event unless it is a One-time request and the Monitoring Event is available to the MME/SGSN at the time of sending Insert Subscriber Data Answer. The MME/SGSN deletes the monitoring configuration identified by the SCEF Reference ID for Deletion, if provided.\nNOTE 6:\tThe MME/SGSN will transfer the parameters stored for every monitoring task as part of its context information during an MME/SGSN change.\n7.\tIf the monitoring configuration is successful, the MME/SGSN sends an Insert Subscriber Data Answer (Cause) message to the HSS. If the requested Monitoring Event is available to the MME/SGSN at the time of sending Insert Subscriber Data Answer, then the MME/SGSN includes the Monitoring Event Report in the Insert Subscriber Data Answer message.\n8.\tFor single UE processing, the HSS sends a Monitoring Response (SCEF Reference ID, Cause, Monitoring Event Report) message to the SCEF to acknowledge acceptance of the Monitoring Request and the deletion of the identified monitoring event configuration, if it was requested. The HSS deletes the monitoring event configuration identified by the SCEF Reference ID, if it was requested. If the requested Monitoring Event is available to the HSS at the time of sending Monitoring Response message or was received from the MME/SGSN in step 7, then the HSS includes a Monitoring Event Report in the Monitoring Response message.\nIf it is a One-time request and the Insert Subscriber Data Answer includes a Monitoring Event Report, the HSS deletes the associated Monitoring Event configuration for the individual UE or for the individual group member UE.\nFor group-based processing, if the HSS sent the Monitoring Response in step 4a, i.e. due to having received a Monitoring Request with an External Group Identifier and if the Group Reporting Guard Time was provided in the Monitoring Request, the HSS accumulates multiple responses for the UEs of the group within the Group Reporting Guard Time. After the Group Reporting Guard Time expiration, the HSS sends a Monitoring Indication with the accumulated responses. The HSS includes UE identity(ies) and a Cause value indicating the reason for the failure in the message if the monitoring configuration of the group member failed.\nNOTE 7:\tFor the group-basis Monitoring Event configuration, the HSS may divide the accumulated Monitoring Indications into multiple messages due to e.g. limitation of the message size.\nIn the case of UE mobility, the HSS determines whether the new MME/SGSN supports requested Monitoring Event(s).\n9a.\tFor single UE processing, the SCEF sends a Monitoring Response (Cause, Monitoring Event Report) message to the SCS/AS to acknowledge acceptance of the Monitoring Request and the deletion of the identified monitoring event configuration, if it was requested. If the SCEF received a Monitoring Event Report then it includes the Monitoring Event Report in the Monitoring Response message. If it is a One-time request for an individual UE and the Monitoring Response includes a Monitoring Event Report for the UE, the SCEF deletes the associated Monitoring Event configuration.\n9b.\tFor group-based processing, if no Group Reporting Guard Time was set, then the SCEF sends the Monitor Indication (TLTRI, Cause, Monitoring Event Report) message to the SCS/AS as it receives them from the HSS. Otherwise, it accumulates Monitoring Event for the UEs of the group until the expiration of Group Reporting Guard Time. Upon expiration, the SCEF sends a Monitoring Indication (TLTRI, Cause, list of (External Identifier or MSISDN, Monitoring Event Report)) message to the SCS/AS. A list of accumulated Monitoring Event Report for each UE identified by either External Identifier or MSISDN is also included.\nIf the Monitoring Request is a one-time request for a group of UEs or if Maximum Number of Reports is included for continuous monitoring of group of UEs, the SCEF uses the list of UE Identities that were received in step 8 and the Number of UEs parameter that was received in step 4a to check if the reports for all the individual group member UEs have been received. If the SCEF determines that all reports for all individual group member UEs have been received, the SCEF sends a request to the HSS to delete the associated Monitoring Event configuration for the group.\n9c.\tFor each Monitoring Indication message received in step 9b, the SCS/AS sends a Monitoring Indication Response (Cause) message to the SCEF. Cause value reflects successful or unsuccessful acknowledgement of Monitoring Indication message.\nIf the HSS detects that the current serving MME/SGSN cannot support a requested Monitoring Event or the group-basis monitoring event feature (e.g. after a UE mobility event), the HSS performs the procedures given below.\n-\tNotify the SCEF that the configured Monitoring Event for the UE is considered to be suspended. The SCEF interprets this to mean that the network will temporarily be unable to serve the configured Monitoring Event. In this case:\n-\tWhen the MME/SGSN for the UE changes (e.g. due to UE mobility), and the new MME/SGSN supports the suspended Monitoring Event, the HSS shall configure the new MME/SGSN with the Monitoring Event and notify the SCEF of resumption of the suspended Monitoring Event;\n-\tIf the criteria for Continuous Reporting expire while the Monitoring Event is suspended, the HSS and the SCEF shall independently delete the Monitoring Event.",

      "content": "Loss of connectivity indicates when the 3GPP network detects that the UE is no longer reachable for either signalling or user plane communication. Such condition is identified when the mobile reachability timer expires in the MME or SGSN (see TS 23.401 [7], TS 23.060 [6], when the UE detaches and when an active UE is purged (see TS 29.272 [31])). The SCS/AS may provide a Maximum Detection Time, which indicates the maximum period of time without any communication with the UE after which the SCS/AS is to be informed that the UE is considered to be unreachable.\nNOTE 1:\tAs the Maximum Detection Time of loss of connectivity determines the order of magnitude of the Periodic Update timer, the network should ensure that this Maximum Detection Time and thereby the periodic TAU/RAU timers for the UE remain above lower bound values both for preserving the battery of the UE and for managing the signalling load of the network. So for UEs with battery constraints, it should not be a small time (e.g. on the order of only a few minutes). Even for UEs without battery constraints, trying to fulfil a Maximum Detection Time of loss of connectivity on the order of a few minutes can only apply to a limited number of UEs due to the cost of signalling induced by this feature.\nNOTE 2:\tThe Maximum Detection Time of loss of connectivity is on the order of 1 minute to multiple hours.\n1.\tThe SCS/AS sets Monitoring Type to \"Loss of Connectivity\", and optionally adds Maximum Detection Time prior to sending Monitoring Request to the SCEF as in step 1 of clause 5.6.1.1.\n2.\tThe SCEF executes step 2 of clause 5.6.1.1.\n3.\tThe SCEF executes step 3 of clause 5.6.1.1.\n4. The HSS executes step 4 of clause 5.6.1.1. In addition, it checks whether the Maximum Detection Time is within the range defined by operator policies, and, if acceptable then the HSS sets the subscribed periodic RAU/TAU timer using the value of Maximum Detection Time, if it is provided. If the Maximum Detection Time is not acceptable, the HSS rejects the request by executing step 8, and provides a Cause value indicating the reason for the failure condition to the SCEF.\nIf the Enhanced Multiple Event Monitoring feature is not supported and if the subscribed periodic RAU/TAU Timer was previously set by a different Monitoring Request identified by a different SCEF Reference ID for the same UE then, depending on operator configuration, the HSS either performs step 8 to reject the Monitoring Request with an appropriate Cause or accepts the request. If the HSS accepts this request, then it cancels the previously accepted Monitoring Request by including the SCEF Reference ID of that Monitoring Request in step 8.\nFor group based processing, if the previously accepted Monitoring Request is associated with a group of UEs and the HSS is not cancelling the previously accepted Monitoring Request for all UEs in the group, then the HSS provides the list of affected UEs (identified by External Identifier or MSISDN) as well as operation indication (cancellation or addition) to the SCEF in step 8.\nIf the Enhanced Multiple Event Monitoring feature is supported, and if the subscribed periodic RAU/TAU Timer was previously set by a different Monitoring Request or Network Parameter Configuration identified by a different SCEF Reference ID for the same UE, as long as the Maximum Detection Time is within the range defined by operator policies, the HSS shall accept the request. If the newly received Maximum Detection Time is lower than the provided subscribed periodic RAU/TAU timer, the HSS shall set the subscribed periodic RAU/TAU timer using the newly received Maximum Detection Time as described in clause 4.5.6.2. The HSS may notify the SCEF (which then notifies the SCS/AS) of the actual value that is being applied in the 3GPP network.\nNOTE 3:\tSince the value of the mobile reachable timer is larger than the value of the periodic RAU/TAU timer (by four minutes as a default), the HSS may set the subscribed periodic RAU/TAU timer to a smaller value than the value of Maximum Detection Time.\n5.\tThe HSS executes step 5 of clause 5.6.1.1. In addition:\n-\tif the Enhanced Multiple Event Monitoring feature is not supported and the HSS accepts new monitoring event configuration and cancel the existing monitoring event configuration, the HSS includes the new monitoring event configuration information, the SCEF Reference ID for Deletion of the cancelled monitoring event configuration with an appropriate Cause, and the subscribed periodic RAU/TAU Timer (if modified).\nWhen HSS accepts new configured Monitoring Event for UEs in step 4 above, the HSS includes the new monitoring event configuration information and the subscribed periodic RAU/TAU Timer (if modified).\nWhen HSS removes a previously configured Monitoring Event for UEs in step 4 above, the HSS also deletes the previously configured Monitoring Event in the MME/SGSN, if applicable.\n-\tIf the Enhanced Multiple Event Monitoring feature is supported, the HSS includes the new monitoring event configuration information and the subscribed periodic RAU/TAU Timer (if modified).\nWhen HSS modifies a previously configured Monitoring Event for UE(s) in step 4 above, the HSS also updates the previously configured Monitoring Event in the MME/SGSN, if applicable.\n6.\tThe MME/SGSN executes step 6 of clause 5.6.1.1.

      "content": "For UE that is not reachable at the time of monitoring event configuration, UE reachability indicates when the UE becomes reachable for sending either SMS or downlink data to the UE, which is detected when the UE transitions to ECM-CONNECTED mode (for a UE using Power Saving Mode or extended idle mode DRX) or when the UE will become reachable for paging (for a UE using extended idle mode DRX). If the UE is reachable at monitoring event configuration, the MME shall immediately send UE reachability event report. This monitoring event supports Reachabilty for SMS and Reachability for Data. Only a One-time Monitoring Request for Reachability for SMS is supported. The SCS/AS may include the following parameters in the Monitoring Event configuration request to the SCEF:\n-\tReachability Type indicating whether the request is for \"Reachability for SMS\", or \"Reachability for Data\", or both.\n-\tOptionally, Maximum Latency indicating maximum delay acceptable for downlink data transfers. Maximum Latency is used for setting the periodic TAU/RAU timer for the UE as it sets the maximum period after which a UE has to connect to the network again and thereby becomes reachable. Determined by the operator, low values for Maximum Latency may deactivate PSM.\n-\tOptionally, Maximum Response Time indicating the time for which the UE stays reachable to allow the SCS/AS to reliably deliver the required downlink data. Maximum Response Time is used for setting the Active Time for the UE. When the UE uses extended idle mode DRX, the Maximum Response Time is used to determine how early this monitoring event should be reported to the SCS/AS before the next Paging Occasion occurs.\n-\tOptionally, Suggested number of downlink packets indicating the number of packets that the Serving Gateway shall buffer if the UE is not reachable.\nNOTE 1:\tAs the Maximum Latency determines the order of magnitude of the Periodic Update timer, the network should ensure that this Maximum Latency and thereby the periodic TAU/RAU timers for the UE remain above lower bound values both for preserving the battery of the UE and for managing the signalling load of the network. So for UEs with battery constraints, it should not be a small time (e.g. on the order of only a few minutes). Even for UEs without battery constraints, trying to fulfil a Maximum Latency on the order of a few minutes can only apply to a limited number of UEs due to the cost of signalling induced by this feature.\nNOTE 2:\tThe Maximum Latency is on the order of 1 minute to multiple hours.\nNOTE 3:\tThe Network Parameter Configuration via SCEF feature (see clause 4.5.21) feature supersedes the option of setting Reachability Type to \"configuration\" during configuration of the UE Reachability Monitoring Event which is no longer recommended.\n1.\tThe SCS/AS sets Monitoring Type to \"UE Reachability\", and includes Reachability Type, and any combination of the following optional parameters: Maximum Latency, Maximum Response Time, Suggested number of downlink packets, and Idle Status Indication prior to sending the Monitoring Request to the SCEF as in step 1 of clause 5.6.1.1.\n2.\tThe SCEF executes step 2 of clause 5.6.1.1. In addition, it checks whether the Maximum Latency (if included), the Maximum Response Time (if included), and the Suggested number of downlink packets (if included) are within the range defined by operator policies. If not, or if the network does not support Idle Status Indication, then depending on operator policies, the SCEF rejects the request by performing step 9 of 5.6.1.1 with an appropriate cause value.\n3.\tWhen \"Reachability for SMS\" is requested, the SCEF subscribes with the HSS by executing step 3 of 5.6.1.1 to get notified when the HSS is notified that the UE is reachable. The HSS performs the UE Reachability Notification Request procedure for getting a UE Activity Notification as described in TS 23.401 [7] and/or uses the UE Reachability function as described in TS 23.060 [6]. The Mobile-Station-Not-Reachable-Flag (MNRF) handling is described in TS 23.040 [12].\nWhen \"Reachability for Data\" is requested, the SCEF executes step 3 of 5.6.1.1. In addition, if provided, it includes Maximum Latency, Maximum Response Time, and Idle Status Indication.\n4.\tThe HSS executes step 4 of clause 5.6.1.1. In addition, it checks whether the Maximum Latency, if provided, is within the range defined by operator policies, and if acceptable, the HSS sets the subscribed periodic RAU/TAU timer using the value of Maximum Latency, if it is provided. If the requested timer value is not acceptable, the HSS rejects the request by executing step 8, and provides a Cause value indicating the reason for the failure condition to the SCEF. In addition, the HSS checks whether the Suggested number of downlink packets is within the range defined by operator policies. If it is not, then the HSS rejects the request by executing step 8, and provides a Cause value indicating the reason for failure condition to the SCEF.\nIf the Enhanced Multiple Event Monitoring feature is not supported and if the subscribed periodic RAU/TAU timer was previously set by a different Monitoring Request identified by a different SCEF Reference ID for the same UE then, depending on operator configuration, the HSS either performs step 8 to reject the Monitoring Request with an appropriate Cause or accepts the request. In the case that the HSS accepts this request, then it cancels the previously accepted Monitoring Request by including the SCEF Reference ID of that Monitoring Request in step 8. If the HSS supports Idle Status Indication, then it includes it in step 5.\nFor group based processing, if the previously accepted Monitoring Request is associated with a group of UEs and the HSS is not cancelling the previously accepted Monitoring Request for all UEs in the group, then the HSS provides the indicated UEs (External Identifier or MSISDN) as well as operation indication (cancellation or addition) to the SCEF in step 8.\nIf the Enhanced Multiple Event Monitoring feature is supported, and if the subscribed periodic RAU/TAU Timer, or Active Time, or Suggested number of downlink packets, or any combination were previously set by a different Monitoring Request or Network Parameter Configuration identified by a different SCEF Reference ID for the same UE, as long as the Maximum Latency (if received), and Maximum Response Time (if received) and Suggested number of downlink packets (if received) are within the range defined by operator policies, the HSS shall accept the request as follows:\n-\tIf the newly received Maximum Latency is lower than the provided subscribed periodic RAU/TAU timer, the HSS shall set the subscribed periodic RAU/TAU timer using the newly received Maximum Latency.\n-\tIf the newly received Maximum Response Time is higher than the provided subscribed Active Time (i.e. previously provided Maximum Response Time), the HSS shall set the subscribed Active Time using the newly received Maximum Response Time.\n-\tIf Suggested number of downlink packets is newly received, the HSS shall add the newly received value to the currently used value of Suggested number of downlink packets if the aggregated value is within the operator defined range. If the aggregated value is not within the operator defined range, the HSS shall set the subscribed Suggested number of downlink packets according to operator defined range.\nThe HSS may notify the SCEF (which then notifies the SCS/AS) of the actual value of Maximum Latency and Maximum Response Time that are being applied in the 3GPP network.\n5.\tThe HSS executes step 5 of clause 5.6.1.1. In addition:\n-\tif the Enhanced Multiple Event Monitoring feature is not supported and the HSS accepts new monitoring event configuration and cancel the existing monitoring event configuration, the HSS includes the subscribed periodic RAU/TAU timer (if modified), new received Maximum Response Time (if provided), new received Suggested number of downlink packets (if configured or provided), Idle Status Indication (if provided) and the SCEF Reference ID for Deletion of the cancelled monitoring event configuration and appropriate Cause.\nWhen HSS accepts new configured Monitoring Event for UEs in step 4 above, the HSS includes the subscribed periodic RAU/TAU timer (if modified), Maximum Response Time (if provided), Suggested number of downlink packets (if configured or provided) and Idle Status Indication (if provided).\nWhen HSS removes a previously configured Monitoring Event for UEs in step 4 above, the HSS also deletes the previously configured Monitoring Event in the MME/SGSN, if applicable.\n-\tIf the Enhanced Multiple Event Monitoring feature is supported, the HSS includes the subscribed periodic RAU/TAU timer (if modified), Maximum Response Time (if modified), Suggested number of downlink packets (if modified) and Idle Status Indication.\nWhen HSS modify a previously configured Monitoring Event for UEs in step 4 above, the HSS also updates the previously configured Monitoring Event in the MME/SGSN, if applicable.\n6.\tThe MME/SGSN executes step 6 of clause 5.6.1.1 and starts watching for the UE entering connected mode. At every subsequent TAU/RAU procedure, the MME/SGSN applies the subscribed periodic RAU/TAU timer.\n7.\tStep 7 of clause 5.6.1.1 is executed.\n8.\tStep 8 of clause 5.6.1.1 is executed.

One-time and Continuous Location Reporting are supported for the Current Location. For Continuous Location Reporting, unless a Minimum Reporting Interval was provided, the serving node(s) sends a notification every time it becomes aware of a location change. The granularity depends on the accepted Accuracy.\nMinimum Reporting Interval is an optional parameter that indicates a minimum time interval between Location Reporting notifications.

While the timer is running the MME/SGSN suppresses sending Location Reporting notification(s). If at least one Location Reporting notification was suppressed while the timer was running, on expiry of the timer the MME/SGSN sends location information that was contained in the latest suppressed Location Reporting notification and restarts the timer. If the MME/SGSN is relocated, the source MME/SGSN shall transfer the current value of the timer to the target MME/SGSN.

      "content": "This monitoring event allows the SCS/AS to ask for the number of UEs that are in the geographic area described by the SCS/AS. The SCS/AS may ask for the UEs that the system knows by its normal operation to be within the area (Last Known Location) or the SCS/AS may request the system to also actively look for the UEs within the area (Current Location). Whether the request is for Current Location or Last Known Location is indicated by the parameter Location Type. For this monitoring event only One-time reporting is supported and the Monitoring Duration as well as the Maximum Number of Reports parameters shall be ignored by the SCEF if present in the request.\nIn this release only Last Known Location is supported for this monitoring event.\nWhen the SCS/AS includes External Group Identifier(s) in the monitoring request, the MME/SGSN counts the number of UEs at the requested location that have each IMSI Group Identifier(s) in its subscription information corresponding to the External Group Identifier(s) received from SCS/AS. The report that is provided by the network to the SCS/AS shall include the number of UEs in the geographic area per External Group Identifier.\nNOTE 1:\tThe system load resulting from this request may be highly dependent on Location Type.\n1.\tThe SCS/AS sets Monitoring Type to \"Number of UEs present in a geographic area\" and adds Location Type and Geographic Area before sending Monitoring Request to the SCEF as in step 1 of clause 5.6.2.1. The request may optionally include External Group Identifier(s).\n2.\tThe SCEF executes step 2 of clause 5.6.2.1. In addition, the SCEF maps the Geographic Area to a list of cells, eNodeBs and/or RAI(s)/TAI(s) and identifies the MMEs/SGSNs serving them by resolving the RA(s)/TA(s) to node addresses.\nNOTE 2:\tThe mapping of Geographic Areas to serving operator (MNO) network list of cells, eNodeBs and/or RAs/TAs, and the identity of the associated serving nodes (e.g. MMEs/SGSNs) is configured at the SCEF.\n3.\tThe SCEF adds Monitoring Type, Location Type, list of cells, eNodeBs and/or RAI(s)/TAI(s) before sending the Monitoring Request to those MMEs/SGSNs identified in step 3 of clause 5.6.2.1. If External Group Identifier(s) were included in step 1, then the IMSI-Group Identifier(s) that were obtained in step 2 are included in the request to the MME/SGSN.\n4.\tThe MME/SGSN executes step 4 of clause 5.6.2.1. In addition, if the request is for Last Known Location with cell or eNodeB granularity or for a location with RA/TA granularity, the MMEs/SGSNs collect all UEs for which the MME/SGSN stores a last known cell, eNodeB or RA/TA registration information that corresponds to the requested location.\nNOTE 3:\tFor Location Type Last Known Location, how the MME/SGSN determines the candidate set of UEs to be included is left to implementation.\n5.\tThe MME/SGSN executes step 5 of clause 5.6.2.1. The response from the MME/SGSN includes the count of the number of UEs at the requested location. If the request of step 3 included an IMSI-Group Identifier(s), the report from the MME/SGSN shall include the number of UEs in the geographic area per IMSI-Group Identifier(s). When IMSI-Group Identifier(s) were included in the request of step 3, the MME/SGSN may optionally, depending on operator configuration, include either the External Identifiers or the MSISDNs of the UEs that are associated with each IMSI-Group Identifier(s).\n6.\tThe SCEF combines the results from all involved MMEs/SGSNs to the total sum, i.e. the Number of UEs, and executes step 6 of clause 5.6.2.1. When External Identifiers or MSISDNs were included in the results that were received from the MME(s)/SGSN(s) in step 5, they are included in the response to the SCS/AS.",

      "content": "The following figure illustrates the common procedure flow of reporting Monitoring Events that are detected by the MME/SGSN or HSS. The steps specific to different Monitoring Event types are detailed in clauses 5.6.3.2 to 5.6.3.8.\nFigure 5.6.3.1-1: Monitoring event reporting procedure\n1a.\tA Monitoring Event is detected by the MME/SGSN at which the Monitoring Event is configured.\n1b. Either a Monitoring Event is detected by the HSS, or the HSS needs to inform the SCEF about the change of status (suspend/resume/cancel) of an ongoing monitoring if an event related with the change of monitoring support at the serving node, (e.g. lack of monitoring support in MME/SGSN or revocation of monitoring authorization) is detected in the HSS. The HSS also stores the time when the Event is detected or the status is changed.\n2a.\tThe MME/SGSN sends a Monitoring Indication (SCEF Reference ID(s), Monitoring Event Report, User Identity) message to the SCEF. The SCEF store the time when it receives the Monitoring Indication.\nIf the Monitoring Event configuration was triggered by a One-time Monitoring Request, then the Monitoring Event configuration is deleted by the MME/SGSN upon completion of this step. If the MME/SGSN has a Maximum Number of Reports stored for this monitoring task, the MME/SGSN shall decrease its value by one. If the value of remaining number of reports is zero, the MME/SGSN shall locally remove the Monitoring Event Configuration. If the Monitoring Event configuration includes User Identity, the MME/SGSN sends the Monitoring Indication message including the User Identity. So that the SCEF can determine what groups the report pertains to, multiple SCEF Reference IDs can be included if the UE is part of multiple groups that require the same monitoring indication.\n2b.\tWhen reporting for an individual UE or individual Group Member UE, the HSS sends a Monitoring Indication (SCEF Reference ID(s), External ID or MSISDN, Monitoring Event Report) message to the SCEF. External ID or MSISDN are only included if the indication is associated with an individual Group Member UE. If the Monitoring Event configuration was triggered by a One-time Monitoring Request, then the Monitoring Event configuration for the individual UE and for the individual group member UE is deleted by the HSS upon completion of this step. If the HSS has a Maximum Number of Reports stored for this monitoring task, the HSS shall decrease its value by one. Based on SCEF Reference ID, the SCEF can determine what groups the report pertains to. Multiple SCEF Reference IDs can be included if the UE is part of multiple groups that require the same monitoring indication.\nIf Group Reporting Guard Time was provided during the Monitoring Event configuration procedure, the HSS accumulates a Monitoring Event for the UEs of the group within the Group Reporting Guard Time. After the Group Reporting Guard Time expiration, the HSS send a Monitoring Indication (SCEF Reference ID, (Monitoring Event Report(s), External ID or MSISDN) Set, External Group ID) message to the SCEF. For each group member UE all the Monitoring Event Report and the corresponding stored time(s) are sent to the SCEF.\nThe External Group ID may be included in the message to indicate that the event has been detected for all group members. When the External Group ID is included in the indication, External ID(s) and MSISDN(s) are optional.\nNOTE:\tFor the group-basis Monitoring Event configuration, the HSS may divide the accumulated Monitoring Event Reports into multiple Monitoring indication messages due to the limitation of the message size.\n3a.\tUsing the SCEF Reference ID, the SCEF retrieves the associated TLTRI along with the T8 Destination Address.\nIf the TLTRI refers to a Monitoring Event Configuration for a single UE, the SCEF sends a Monitoring Indication (TLTRI, Cause, Monitoring Event Report) message to the identified destination. If the TLTRI refers to a group-based Monitoring Event configuration, and if no Group Reporting Guard Time was set, then the SCEF sends a Monitoring Indication (TLTRI(s), Cause, Monitoring Event Report) message to the identified destination. So that the SCEF can determine what groups the report pertains to, multiple TLTRIs can be included if the UE is part of multiple groups that require the same monitoring indication.\nIf the TLTRI refers to a group-based Monitoring Event Configuration, and if Group Reporting Guard Time was provided during the Monitoring Event configuration procedure, then the SCEF accumulates Monitoring Event for the UEs of the group until the Group Reporting Guard Time expiry. Upon expiration of which, the SCEF sends a Monitoring Indication (TLTRI, Cause, list of (External Identifier or MSISDN, Monitoring Event Report(s))) message to the identified destination. A list of accumulated Monitoring Event Report for each group member UE identified by either External Identifier or MSISDN is also included. For each group member UE all the received Monitoring Event Report, and the corresponding time received at SCEF or the time value sent by HSS, are sent to the SCS/AS.\nFor individual UE, if a report is received (step 2a or step 2b) for One-time Monitoring Request or the maximum number of reports is reached for a Continuous Monitoring Request, the SCEF requests the HSS (for monitoring events configured via HSS) to delete the related monitoring event configuration for the individual UE and deletes also its associated Monitoring Event configuration according to the procedure of clause 5.6.1.1 step 3-8.\nFor an individual group member UE, if a report is received (step 2a or step 2b) for One-time Monitoring Request or the maximum number of reports is reached for a Continuous Monitoring Request, based on the Number of UEs received in step 4a in clause 5.6.1.1 and local policy, the SCEF shall either:\n-\trequest the HSS (for monitoring events configured via HSS) to delete the related monitoring event configuration for the individual group member UE; or\n-\twait until reports for all group member UEs are complete and then request the HSS (for monitoring events configured via HSS) to delete the related monitoring event configuration.\nThe SCEF uses the identity of individual group member UE(s) (i.e. External Identifier or MSISDN) received in the step 2a or step 2b and the Number of UEs received in step 4a in clause 5.6.1.1 to determine if reporting for the group is complete. If it is complete, the SCEF deletes the associated Monitoring Event configuration for the group.\n3b.\tFor each Monitoring Indication message received in step 3a, the SCS/AS sends a Monitoring Indication Response (Cause) message to the SCEF. Cause value reflects successful or unsuccessful acknowledgement of Monitoring Indication message.\nWhen the Monitoring Duration expires for a continuous Monitoring Request in the HSS, the MME/SGSN or the SCEF, then each of these nodes shall locally delete the related Monitoring Event configuration associated with the individual UE or group member UE.",

Figure 5.8.2-1 illustrates the procedure.\nFigure 5.8.2-1: Request procedure for one-time or continuous reporting of network status\n1.\tWhen the SCS/AS needs to retrieve NSI, the SCS/AS sends a Network Status Request (Geographical area, SCS/AS Identifier, Duration, Threshold) message to the SCEF. Duration indicates the time for which a continuous reporting is requested. The absence of Duration indicates a one-time reporting.

The SCEF stores SCS/AS Address, TLTRI, Duration, if present, and Threshold, if present. The SCEF assigns an SCEF Reference ID.\n2b.\tThe SCEF sends a Network Status Response (TLTRI, cause).

The Location Area is according to operator configuration either a 3GPP location area (e.g. list of TA/RAs, list of cell(s), list of eNodeBs, etc.) or a sub-area of the Geographical Area provided by the SCS/AS.

The operator shall ensure that any of the PCRFs in the network is able to make the decision about transfer policy for background data transfer for non-roaming UEs.\nThe transfer policy will be stored in the SPR together with a Reference ID. This ensures that the transfer policy is available to every PCRF responsible for a UE which is subject to this background data transfer in the future. In addition, other (or the same) PCRF can take this transfer policy into account during subsequent decisions about transfer policies for background data related to other SCS/AS.\nAt a later point in time, when the SCS/AS (acting as an AF), contacts the PCRF for individual UEs, e.g. to request sponsored connectivity for background data transfer, the SCS/AS needs to also provide the Reference ID together with the SCS/AS session information via the Rx interface. Alternatively, the SCS/AS activates the selected transfer policy via the SCEF, for each UE in the group, by using the \"Set the chargeable party at session set-up\" or \"Change the chargeable party during the session\" procedure from clauses 5.12.1 and 5.12.2 to provide the Reference ID to the same or different PCRF. The Reference ID enables the PCRF to correlate the SCS/AS request (that is related to the UE) with the transfer policy retrieved from the SPR (that is related to the SCS/AS).

Sets of these CP parameters are provided by the SCEF to the HSS which distributes them to the corresponding MME with relevant subscriber data. These CP parameter sets may be related to both PDN connection(s) and SMS transmission. The MME considers the sets of CP parameters (e.g. by merging per CP parameter if multiple sets are present), before using the parameters. Each CP parameter set shall have an associated validity time. The validity time indicates when the CP parameter set expires and shall be deleted by the HSS/MME. The validity time may be set to a value indicating that the particular CP parameter set has no expiration time. When the validity time expires, the involved nodes (SCEF, HSS, and MME) autonomously delete the associated CP parameter set with no additional signalling between the involved nodes.\nNOTE 1:\tIt is expected that the format of validity time, to be defined by Stage 3, is defined in a manner which allows SCEF, HSS and MME/SGSN to consistently and uniformly interpret the expiration of the associated CP parameters set.\nTable 5.10.1-1: CP parameters\nCP parameter\nDescription\n1)\tPeriodic communication indicator\nIdentifies whether the UE communicates periodically or not, e.g. only on demand.

The CP parameter set(s) include the parameters defined in Table 5.10.1-1. A CP parameter Set Id is assigned to each CP parameter set by the SCS/AS.\nNOTE 1:\tThe SCS/AS uses this procedure to add, change or delete some or all of the CP parameter sets of the UE, e.g. if the AS is aware that the UE has started or stopped moving for a significant time period, especially if the AS is instructing the UE to do so, then the SCS/AS provides the corresponding CP parameter set(s) and its validity time(s) as well their CP parameter Set Id(s) to the SCEF. If the SCS/AS wants to perform deletion of a previously configured CP parameter set(s) together with configuring a new CP parameter set(s), then it shall include both the new CP parameter set(s), and CP parameter Set Id(s) for Deletion representing the CP parameter set(s) which requires cancellation. If the SCS/AS wants to only perform deletion of a previously configured CP parameter set(s), then it shall include CP parameter Set Id(s) for Deletion.\n2.\tThe SCEF checks if the SCS/AS is authorised to send CP requests to the UE or to each UE in the identified group. The SCEF filters and the selects the CP parameter set(s) for add/modify/delete based on operator policy or configuration. The SCEF does not check for potential overlapping of CP parameters if there are multiple CP parameter set(s) for the UE, but this is handled in the MME.\nIn this release, to avoid receiving CP parameter sets from multiple SCEFs that might be overlapping, the HSS shall accept CP parameter sets from only a single SCEF for a given UE.\n3.\tThe SCEF sends Update CP Parameter Request (External Identifier or MSISDN or External Group Identifier, SCEF Reference ID(s), SCEF Address, CP parameter set(s), validity time(s), SCEF Reference ID(s) for Deletion, MTC Provider Information) message to the HSS for delivering the selected CP parameter set(s) per UE. There may be multiple CP parameter sets included in this message where each CP parameter set for addition or modification has been determined to be non-overlapping with other CP parameter sets either included in the message or already provisioned for a given UE. The SCEF derives the SCEF Reference ID(s) for CP parameter sets to be sent to the HSS based on the CP parameter Set Id(s) from the SCS/AS.\nNOTE 2:\tA request for deletion of a CP parameter set from the SCS/AS may result in a request for modification of the non-overlapping CP parameter set by the SCEF.\nNOTE 3:\tThe MTC Provider Information in step 1 is an optional parameter. The SCEF should validate the provided MTC Provider Information and may override it to an SCEF selected MTC Provider Information based on configuration. How the SCEF determines the MTC Provider Information, if not present in step 1, is left to implementation (e.g. based on the requesting SCS/AS)\n4.\tThe HSS examines the Update CP Parameter Request message, e.g. with regard to the existence of External Identifier or MSISSN or External Group Identifier. If the check fails, the HSS immediately sends a response message back to the SCEF following step 5. The HSS resolves the External Identifier or MSISDN to an IMSI or resolves the External Group Identifier to an IMSI-Group Identifier and stores the CP parameter set(s) and their validity time(s) as part of UE subscription data identified by the IMSI or IMSI-Group Identifier, so that the CP parameter set(s) can be forwarded to the serving MME(s) when the serving MME(s) are changed due to the mobility of the UE.\nThe HSS determines that a stored CP parameters set is to be modified by the fact that the SCEF Reference ID associated with the CP parameters set matches an SCEF Reference ID for a CP parameters set already stored for a given UE. If the HSS determines that an existing CP parameter set is to be modified, the HSS discards the already stored CP parameter set and stores the new CP parameter set and validity time under the same SCEF Reference ID.\nThe HSS stores a new CP parameter set along with the associated SCEF Reference ID and validity time.\nIf CP parameters sets are to be deleted, the HSS removes the CP parameters sets from the subscription.\nIf the validity time for a CP parameter set stored in the HSS expires, the HSS autonomously deletes the associated CP parameter set with no additional signalling.\nNOTE 3:\tThe CP parameter set(s) are not provided to the SGSN.\nNOTE 4:\tThe HSS does not need to validate the content of the stored CP parameters set(s).\n5.\tThe HSS sends Update CP Parameter Response (SCEF Reference ID, Cause) message to the SCEF. The cause value indicates successful subscription update or the reason of failed subscription update.\n6.\tThe SCEF sends the Update Response (CP parameter Set Id(s), Cause(s)) message to inform the SCS/AS whether the provision of the CP parameter set(s) was successful.\n7.\tThe HSS initiates an Insert Subscription Data procedure for each UE to send the CP parameter set(s) with the corresponding validity time(s), SCEF Reference ID(s), and SCEF Reference ID(s) for Deletion to the MME. Optionally, the HSS allocates a Provider-Group-ID (different from the IMSI-Group-Id) based on the MTC Provider Information and sends it to the MME to assist the serving node(s) when selecting and differentiating configurations for a given MTC Service Provider (e.g. to delete the CP Set Id(s) for a specific MTC Service Provider at the MME).\nThe MME determines that a stored CP parameters set is to be modified by the fact that the SCEF Reference ID associated with the CP parameters set matches an SCEF Reference ID for a CP parameters set already stored for the UE. If the MME determines that an existing CP parameter set is to be modified, the MME discards the already stored CP parameter set and stores the received CP parameter set with the associated validity time in the UE's (E)MM context under the same SCEF Reference ID.\nThe MME stores a new CP parameter set along with the associated SCEF Reference ID and validity time. The MME may use the CP parameter set(s) as described in TS 23.401 [7].\nIf CP parameter sets are to be deleted, the MME removes the CP parameter sets from the subscription.\nIf the validity time for a CP parameter set stored in the MME expires, the MME autonomously deletes the associated CP parameter set with no additional signalling.",

This priority scheme is an implementation option that is used locally by the SCEF, i.e. it is neither used nor translated in procedures towards other functions.\nNOTE 6:\tWhen more than one SCS/AS is associated with a PDN connection, the parameters that are provided in step 1 can be provisioned in the SCEF based on operator policy or configuration. In which case, any parameters that are provided in step 1 that conflict with the provisioned values are ignored.\n2.\tIf the Requested Action is set to \"Cancel\" it indicates the purpose of the request is to cancel the transaction identified by TLTRI and the flow proceeds to step 6. If the Requested Action is set to \"Update\", the purpose of the transaction is to update the parameters associated with the configuration (i.e. Reliable Data Service, PDN Connection Establishment Option). Otherwise, the request is for a new NIDD configuration and the SCEF stores the External Group Identifier, External Identifier or MSISDN, TLTRI, SCS/AS Identifier, T8 Destination Address, PDN Connection Establishment Option, and NIDD Duration. If either the SCS/AS is not authorized to perform this request (e.g. based on policies, if the SLA does not allow for it) or the NIDD Configuration Request is malformed, the SCEF performs step 6 and provides a Cause value appropriately indicating the error. Depending on the configuration, the SCEF may change the NIDD Duration.\n3.\tThe SCEF sends an NIDD Authorization Request (External Group Identifier or External Identifier or MSISDN, APN, MTC Provider Information) message to the HSS to authorize the NIDD configuration request for the UEs that belongs to the External Group Identifier, received External Identifier or MSISDN, and to receive necessary information for NIDD, if required.\nNOTE 7:\tThe SCEF uses the SCS/AS Identifier and External Group Identifier, External Identifier or MSISDN that was obtained in step 1 to determine what APN will be used to enable transfer of non-IP data between the UE and the SCS/AS. This determination is based on local policies.\nNOTE 8:\tThe MTC Provider Information in step 1 is an optional parameter. The SCEF should validate the provided MTC Provider Information and may override it to an SCEF selected MTC Provider Information based on configuration. How the SCEF determines the MTC Provider Information, if not present in step 1, is left to implementation (e.g. based on the requesting SCS/AS).\n4. The HSS examines the NIDD Authorization Request message, e.g. with regards to the existence of External Group Identifier, External Identifier or MSISDN. If an External Identifier was included in the NIDD Authorization Request, the HSS maps the external identifier to IMSI and/or MSISDN and updates the SCEF ID field of the PDN subscription context for the provided APN with the requesting SCEF's ID. Otherwise, if an External Group Identifier was included in the NIDD Authorization Request, the HSS authorizes the NIDD configuration request for the received External Group Identifier, resolves the External Group Identifier to an IMSI-Group Identifier and an External Identifier and/or MSISDN for each of the IMSIs in the IMSI-Group. If this check fails, the HSS follows step 5 and provides a result indicating the reason for the failure condition to the SCEF. If the SCEF ID is different from the one in the PDN subscription contexts for the provided APN, the HSS updates the SCEF ID at the MME/SGSN for the provided APN. If this update fails, the HSS follows step 5 and provides a result indicating the reason for the failure condition to the SCEF.\nNOTE 9:\tHow the HSS selects an External ID when multiple External IDs are associated with the same IMSI is left to implementation, e.g. based on the MTC Provider Information (if received) or the default External ID (if not received).\n5.\tThe HSS sends an NIDD Authorization Response (with single value or list of (IMSI and MSISDN or External Identifier), Result) message to the SCEF to acknowledge acceptance of the NIDD Authorization Request. If the HSS determines that the list size exceeds the message capacity, the HSS shall segment the list and send it in multiple messages (for details on segmentation, see TS 29.336 [45]). The IMSI(s) and, if available, the MSISDN(s) (when NIDD Configuration Request contains an External Identifier) or if available, External Identifier(s) (when NIDD Configuration Request contains an MSISDN) are returned by the HSS in this message. This allows the SCEF to correlate the SCS/AS request received in step 1 of this procedure to the T6a/T6b Connection established (see clause 5.13.1.2) for each UE or each group member UE.\n6.\tThe SCEF sends an NIDD Configuration Response (TLTRI, Maximum Packet Size, Reliable Data Service Indication, and Cause) message to the SCS/AS to acknowledge acceptance of the NIDD Configuration Request and the deletion of the identified NIDD configuration, if it was requested. If the NIDD Configuration was accepted, the SCEF will create an association between the TLTRI, External Group Identifier or External Identifier or MSISDN, IMSI, and EBI of the non-IP PDN Connection. In the MT NIDD procedure, the SCEF will use TLTRI and External Group Identifier or External Identifier or MSISDN to determine the IMSI(s) and EBI(s) of the non-IP PDN Connection(s). In the MO NIDD procedure, the SCEF will use the IMSI(s) and EBI(s) to obtain the TLTRI, External Identifier or MSISDN. The Reliable Data Service Indication indicates if the Reliable Data Service is enabled in the APN configuration. The Maximum Packet Size is the maximum NIDD packet size that was transferred to the UE by the SCEF in the PCO, see clause 4.5.14.1. If no maximum packet size was provided to the UE by the SCEF, the SCEF sends a default configured max packet size to SCS/AS.",

      "content": "Figure 5.13.3-1 illustrates the procedure using which the SCS/AS sends non-IP data to a given user as identified via External Identifier or MSISDN. This procedure assumes that procedures in clause 5.13.1 is completed.\nFigure 5.13.3-1: Mobile Terminated NIDD procedure\n1.\tIf SCS/AS has already activated the NIDD service for a given UE, and has downlink non-IP data to send to the UE, the SCS/AS sends a MT NIDD Submit Request (External Identifier or MSISDN, TLTRI, non-IP data, non-IP data sequence number, Reliable Data Service Configuration, Maximum Latency, Priority, PDN Connection Establishment Option) message to the SCEF. The Maximum Latency is an optional field that is used to indicate maximum delay acceptable for downlink data and may be used to configure the buffer duration; a Maximum Latency of 0 indicates that buffering is not allowed. If Maximum Latency is not provided, the SCEF determines the acceptable delay based on local polices. Priority is an optional field that is used to indicate the priority of the non-IP data packet relative to other non-IP data packets. If Priority is not provided, the SCEF determines the acceptable delay based on local polices. Reliable Data Service Configuration is an optional parameter that is used to configure the Reliable Data Service (as defined in clause 4.5.14.3); it may be used to indicate if a Reliable Data Service acknowledgment is requested and port numbers for originator application and receiver application. PDN Connection Establishment Option an optional field that is used to indicate what the SCEF should do if the UE has not established the PDN connection (wait for the UE to establish the PDN connection, respond with an error cause, or send a device trigger; see step 2). If PDN Connection Establishment Option is not provided with the non-IP packet, the SCEF uses the PDN Connection Establishment Option that was provided during NIDD Configuration to decide how to handle the absence of a PDN connection. Non-IP data sequence number is an optional field that refers to earlier MT NIDD requests, it is only included if the purpose of the MT NIDD Submit Request is to replace or purge data that is buffered in the SCEF. If an MT NIDD Submit Request is received with non-IP data and a non-IP data sequence that is equal to a request that is already buffered, then the buffered data is replaced. If an MT NIDD Submit Request is received with no non-IP data and a non-IP data sequence that is equal to a request that is already buffered, then the buffered data is purged.\nThe Maximum Latency Parameter provided by the SCS/AS in this procedure is only used by the SCEF to determine the maximum acceptable delay for associated non-IP data and is not propagated further by the SCEF.\n2.\tThe SCEF determines the EPS Bearer Context based on the APN associated with the NIDD configuration and the User Identity. If an SCEF EPS bearer context corresponding to the External Identifier or MSISDN included in step 1 is found, then the SCEF checks whether the SCS/AS is authorised to send NIDD requests and that the SCS/AS has not exceeded the quota (e.g. 200 bytes in 24hrs) or rate (e.g. 10 bytes / hour) of data submission to the SCEF EPS bearer. When determining the quota and the rate of data submissions, the SCEF considers the APN Rate Control pre-configured in the SCEF and the Serving PLMN Rate Control parameter that was received from MME during the T6a/b connection establishment. The SCEF considers already buffered data during the check of whether the quota or the rate was exceeded. If the SCEF receives additional NIDD request(s) while already buffering data, the SCEF considers the non-IP data priority when checking the quota and the rate and deciding whether to buffer the additional non-IP data. If this check is successful and SCEF buffers the additional non-IP data, the SCEF continues with step 5. If this check fails or if the non-IP packet size is larger than then the Maximum Packet Size that was provided to the SCS/AS during NIDD Configuration, the SCEF sends a MT NIDD Submit Response (Cause) with a cause value indicating the reason for the failure condition and the flow stops at this step. Otherwise, the flow continues with step 3.\nIf no SCEF EPS bearer context is found, then the SCEF, depending on PDN Connection Establishment Option, may either:\n-\tsend a MT NIDD Submit Response (Cause) with appropriate error cause value. The flow stops at this step; or\n-\tperform device triggering towards the UE to establish a PDN Connection of type Non-IP to the default APN by using T4 SMS device triggering to a pre-defined SMS Application Port ID (refer to clause 5.2.2). In this case, the SCEF sends a MT NIDD Submit Response (non-IP data sequence, Buffered Indication, Trigger Indication, cause) with an appropriate cause value. The Buffered Indication indicates if the SCEF buffered the non-IP data. The non-IP data sequence number is assigned by the SCEF and may be used by the SCS/AS to overwrite or purge the buffered data at a later time. The Trigger Indication is used to indicate that a trigger was sent in order to establish the PDN connection. If data is not buffered, the flow stops at this step, otherwise, it proceeds to step 6. The SCEF may use Priority to configure the priority of the device trigger and may use Maximum Latency to configure the validity period of the device trigger; or\nNOTE 1:\tIt is left to stage 3 to reserve the SMS Application Port ID number that will be used to carry the trigger to the UE to indicate that the UE should establish a PDN Connection of type Non-IP to the default APN.\n-\taccept the MT NIDD Submit Request, and execute step 5 with an appropriate cause value, and wait for the UE to perform a procedure (see TS 23.401 [7]) causing the establishment of a PDN connection to the SCEF (see clause 5.13.1.2). If data is not buffered, the flow stops at step 5.\nNOTE 2:\tThe duration for which the SCEF may wait for establishment of a PDN connection to the SCEF for the given UE is implementation dependent.\n3.\tIf an SCEF EPS bearer context corresponding to the External Identifier or MSISDN included in step 1 is found, then the SCEF sends a NIDD Submit Request (User Identity, EPS Bearer ID, SCEF ID, non-IP data, SCEF Wait Time, Maximum Re-transmission time) message toward the MME/SGSN. SCEF Wait Time indicates how long the SCEF is prepared to wait for MME/SGSN response. Maximum Re-transmission indicates how long the SCEF is prepared to re-transmit the message.\nIf the IWK-SCEF receives a NIDD Submit Request message from the SCEF, it relays the message to the MME/SGSN.\n4.\tIf the MME/SGSN can immediately deliver the non-IP data to the UE e.g. when UE is already in ECM_CONNECTED mode, or UE is in ECM_IDLE and MME/SGSN is able to initiate paging procedure (see TS 23.401 [7]), the procedure proceeds at step 8.\nIf the MME/SGSN is aware of the UE being temporarily unreachable, or if the MME/SGSN knows that the UE is not scheduled to be reachable within the SCEF Wait Time, while using power saving functions e.g. UE Power Saving Mode (see clause 4.5.4) or extended idle mode DRX (see clause 4.5.13), then the MME/SGSN may send a NIDD Submit Response (Cause, Requested Re-Transmission Time) message towards the SCEF. The Cause parameter indicates that Non-IP data was not delivered to the UE, as the UE is temporarily not reachable due to power saving but the MME/SGSN will notify the SCEF when the MME/SGSN determines the UE is reachable. The MME/SGSN sets the Not Reachable for NIDD flag in the EMM context for this UE and stores the corresponding SCEF address. If the Maximum Re-transmission Time was included in the Request, the MME may indicate in Requested Re-Transmission time IE the time when the SCEF is expected to re-transmit the DL data to the currently unreachable UE.\n5.\tThe SCEF may send a MT NIDD Submit Response (Requested Re-Transmission time, non-IP data sequence number, Buffered Indication, Cause) to the SCS/AS informing of the received results from the MME/SGSN. If the SCEF receives from the MME/SGSN a Cause value indicating that UE is temporarily not reachable due to power saving, the SCEF can buffer the non-IP data requested at step 3 based on the configuration and proceed to step 6. The Buffered Indication indicates if the SCEF buffered the non-IP data. The non-IP data sequence number is assigned by the SCEF and may be used by the SCS/AS to overwrite or purge the buffered data at a later time. If, in step 2, the SCEF buffered the non-IP data and is waiting for the UE to establish a PDN connection, then the SCEF proceeds to step 7 after T6a Connection Establishment. The Requested Re-Transmission tells the SCS/AS when the SCEF is expected to re-transmit the DL data to the currently unreachable UE.\n6.\tWhen the MME/SGSN detects that the UE is reachable (e.g. when coming out of PSM mode by performing TAU/RAU, when initiating MO communication etc.), or when the UE is about to become reachable (e.g. extended idle mode DRX cycle expiring, MME/SGSN anticipating MO communication pattern for the UE etc.), and the MME/SGSN has the Not Reachable for NIDD flag set, then the MME/SGSN sends a NIDD Submit Indication (User Identity) message towards the SCEF. The MME/SGSN clears the Not Reachable for NIDD flag from its EMM context.\nIf the MME included the Requested Re-transmission-Time in the NIDD Submit Response, the MME sends a NIDD Submit Indication (User Identity) message towards the SCEF only if the UE becomes reachable before the Requested Re-transmission Time. The MME shall clear the Not Reachable for NIDD flag when the Requested Re-transmission Time expires and the UE has not become reachable yet.\nIf the MME/SGSN sends the NIDD Submit Request message towards the SCEF as described in clause 5.13.4 or an Update Serving Node Information Request message towards the SCEF as described in clause 5.13.6, then the MME/SGSN clears the Not Reachable for NIDD flag from its EMM context, but it need not send the NIDD Submit Indication message. If the SCEF receives the NIDD Submit Request message or an Update Serving Node Information Request from the MME/SGSN for this UE, the SCEF may consider it an implicit NIDD Submit Indication, and proceed with step 7.\n7.\tIf the data has not been purged, the SCEF sends a NIDD Submit Request (User Identity, EPS Bearer ID, SCEF ID, non-IP data, SCEF Wait Time, Maximum Re-transmission time) message toward the MME/SGSN.\n8.\tIf required, the MME/SGSN pages the UE and delivers the non-IP data to the UE using data transfer via the MME procedure as described in clause 5.3.4B.3 of TS 23.401 [7] or the SGSN procedure as described in clauses 9.3 and 9.6 of TS 23.060 [6]. Depending on operator configuration, the MME/SGSN may generate the necessary accounting information required for charging.\n9.\tIf the MME/SGSN was able to initiate step 8, then the MME/SGSN sends a NIDD Submit Response (cause) message towards the SCEF acknowledging the NIDD Submit Request from SCEF received in step 3 or step 7. If the eNodeB supports acknowledgements of downlink NIDD delivery and if acknowledgements of downlink NAS data PDUs are enabled in the subscription information for the UE and the eNodeB has acknowledged successful delivery to the MME/SGSN (see clause 5.3.4B.3 of TS 23.401 [7]), the cause is set to 'Success Acknowledged Delivery' otherwise 'Success Unacknowledged Delivery'. If the delivery failed, the cause is 'Unsuccessful delivery'.\nIf Reliable Data Service header indicates that acknowledgement is requested, then the UE shall respond with an acknowledgement to the DL data that was received in step 8 following the Mobile Originated NIDD Procedure in clause 5.13.4, steps 1 - 2 and 5.\nNOTE 3:\tThe 'Success Acknowledged Delivery' implies reliable delivery to the UE using RLC acknowledged mode. The 'Success Unacknowledged Delivery' result does not imply the data is successfully received at the UE, but just the MME/SGSN has sent the non-IP data in NAS signalling to the UE. If the UE sends UL data in response to the received DL data in step 8, then it follows the Mobile Originated NIDD Procedure in clause 5.13.4.\n10.\tThe SCEF sends an MT NIDD Submit Response (Reliable Data Service Acknowledgement Indication, Hop-by-Hop Acknowledgment Indication, non-IP data sequence number, Cause). The Reliable Data Service Acknowledgement Indication is used to indicate if an acknowledgement was received from the UE for the MT NIDD. If the Reliable Data Service was requested in step 1, then the MT NIDD Submit Response is sent to the SCS/AS after the acknowledgement is received from the UE or, if no acknowledgment is received, then the MT NIDD Submit Response is sent to the SCS/AS with a cause value indicating that no acknowledgement was received. When the Reliable Data Service was not requested in step 1, the Hop-by-Hop Acknowledgment Indication may be sent to the SCS/AS indicating the result of the Hop-by-Hop acknowledgment with a value of 'Success Acknowledged Delivery', 'Success Unacknowledged Delivery' or 'Unsuccessful delivery'.",

In the roaming case, the MME/SGSN sends the message to the IWK-SCEF which forwards the message to the SCEF over T7. The MME only includes the MO Exception data counter if the RRC establishment cause is set to \"MO exception data\" and the UE is accessing via the NB-IoT RAT.

If the previously accepted Monitoring Request is associated with a group of UEs and the HSS is not cancelling the previously accepted Monitoring Request for all UEs in the group, then the HSS provides the indicated UEs (External Identifier or MSISDN) to the SCEF in step 10.\nIf the Enhanced Multiple Event Monitoring feature is supported, and if the subscribed periodic RAU/TAU Timer, or Active Time, or Suggested number of downlink packets, or any combination were previously set by a different Monitoring Request or Network Parameter Configuration for the same UE, as long as the Maximum Latency (if received), Maximum Response Time (if received) and Suggested number of downlink packets (if received) are within the range defined by operator policies, the HSS shall accept the request as follows:\n-\tIf the newly received Maximum Latency is lower than the provided subscribed periodic RAU/TAU timer, the HSS shall set the subscribed periodic RAU/TAU timer using the newly received Maximum Latency.\n-\tIf the newly received Maximum Response Time is higher than the provided subscribed Active Time (i.e. previously provided Maximum Response Time), the HSS shall set the subscribed Active Time using the newly received Maximum Response Time.\n-\tIf Suggested number of downlink packets is newly received, the HSS shall add the newly received value to the currently used value of Suggested number of downlink packets if the aggregated value is within the operator defined range. If the aggregated value is not within the operator defined range, the HSS shall set the subscribed Suggested number of downlink packets according to operator defined range.\nThe HSS may notify the SCEF (which then notifies the SCS/AS) of the actual value of Maximum Latency and Maximum Response Time that are being applied in the 3GPP network.\n5.\tFor group based processing (if the HSS received the Set Suggested Network Configuration Response with an External Group Identifier), the HSS sends a Set Suggested Network Configuration Response (SCEF Reference ID, SCEF Reference ID for Deletion, Cause) message to the SCEF to acknowledge acceptance of the Set Suggested Network Configuration Request before beginning the processing of individual UEs indicating that Group processing is in progress.\n6.\tFor group based processing (if the SCEF received the T8 Set Suggested Network Configuration Response with an External Group Identifier), the SCEF sends a T8 Set Suggested Network Configuration Response (TLTRI, Cause) message to the SCS/AS. The Cause value indicates progress of Group processing request.\n7.\tIf the Enhanced Multiple Event Monitoring feature is not supported and the HSS accepts new monitoring event configuration and cancels the existing monitoring event configuration, the HSS sends an Insert Subscriber Data Request (newly received Maximum Response Time (if provided), subscribed periodic RAU/TAU timer (if modified), newly received Suggested Number of Downlink Packets (if provided)) message to the MME/SGSN for the individual UE or for each individual group member UE. When HSS accepts new monitoring event configuration for the indicated UEs in step 4 above, for each indicated UE, the HSS sends such Insert Subscriber Data Request message to the MME/SGSN. When HSS removes a previously configured Monitoring Event for the indicated UEs in step 4 above, the HSS also deletes the previously configured Monitoring Event in the MME/SGSN, if applicable.\nIf the Enhanced Multiple Event Monitoring feature is supported, the HSS sends an Insert Subscriber Data Request (Maximum Response Time (if modified), subscribed periodic RAU/TAU timer (if modified), newly received Suggested Number of Downlink Packets (if the newly received Suggested number of downlink packets is higher than the provided Suggested number of downlink packets) message to the MME/SGSN for the individual UE or for each individual group member UE.\nIf the Set Suggested Network Configuration Request message is for a group of UEs, the HSS sends an Insert Subscriber Data Request message per UE to all the MME/SGSN(s) serving the members of the group. If the HSS received a SCEF Reference ID for Deletion in step 3, the HSS shall stop using the provisioned values and determine the parameters that it notifies to the MME/SGSN as in the case when no externally provisioned parameters apply.\n8.\tThe MME/SGSN verifies the request, e.g. if the parameters are covered by a roaming agreement when the request is from another PLMN. If this check fails, the MME/SGSN follows step 9 and provides a Cause value indicating the reason for the failure condition to the HSS. Based on operator policies, the MME/SGSN may also reject the request due to other reasons (e.g. overload or HSS has exceeded its quota or rate of submitting requests defined by an SLA).\nIf the subscribed periodic RAU/TAU timer was modified, at every subsequent TAU/RAU procedure, the MME/SGSN applies the subscribed periodic RAU/TAU timer.\nNOTE 2:\tThe MME/SGSN will transfer the parameters stored as part of its context information during an MME/SGSN change.\n9.\tThe MME/SGSN sends an Insert Subscriber Data Answer (Cause) message to the HSS.\n10.\tFor single UE processing (if the HSS received the Set Suggested Network Configuration Response without an External Group Identifier), the HSS sends Set Suggested Network Configuration Response (SCEF Reference ID, SCEF Reference ID for Deletion, Maximum Response Time (if modified), Maximum Latency (if modified), Suggested Number of Downlink Packets (if modified), Cancelled SCEF Reference ID, Cause) message to the SCEF to acknowledge acceptance or indicate the rejection of the Set Suggested Network Configuration Request. If the HSS modified any of the parameters that were provided in step 3, the modified values are provided to the SCEF.\nFor group based processing, if the Group Reporting Guard Time was provided in the Request, the HSS accumulates multiple responses for the UEs of the group within the Group Reporting Guard Time. After the Group Reporting Guard Time expiration, the HSS sends a Set Suggested Network Configuration Response (SCEF Reference ID, SCEF Reference ID for Deletion, Cause, list of (External Identifier or MSISDN, Cancelled SCEF Reference ID, Cause)) with the accumulated responses. The HSS includes UE identity(ies) and a Cause value indicating the reason for the failure in the message if the monitoring configuration of the group member failed.\nIf the HSS cancelled Monitoring Event(s) for UE(s) in step 4 and the cancelled Monitoring Event(s) is subscribed by the SCEF which is the same as the one sending the Set Suggested Network Configuration Request at step 1, the HSS includes the SCEF Reference ID of the cancelled Monitoring Event(s) and reason for cancellation event(s) in the Set Suggested Network Configuration response message, or Monitoring Indication message if step 5 is executed already. If the HSS, in step 4 above, decides to cancel Monitoring Event for indicated UEs (i.e. one individual UE or a sub-set of UEs) in the group of UEs for which there was a previously configured Monitoring Event, the HSS also includes the External Identifier or MSISDN of these indicated UEs towards the SCEF.\nIf the HSS, in step 4 above, decides to add Monitoring Event for indicated UEs (i.e. one individual UE or a sub-set of UEs) in the group of UEs for which there was a previously configured Monitoring Event, the HSS includes the External Identifier or MSISDN of these indicated UEs towards the SCEF.\n10a.\tIf the HSS cancelled a Monitoring Event(s) for UE in step 4 and the cancelled Monitoring Event(s) is subscribed by the SCEF which is different from the SCEF sending the Set Suggested Network Configuration Request at step 1, the HSS sends the Monitoring Indication message towards the SCEF which subscribed the cancelled Monitoring Event(s) and includes SCEF Reference ID of a cancelled Monitoring Event(s) and reason of cancellation. If the HSS, in step 4 above, decides to cancel Monitoring Event for indicated UEs (i.e. one individual UE or a sub-set of UEs) in the group of UEs for which there was a previously configured Monitoring Event, the HSS also includes the External Identifier or MSISDN of these indicated UEs towards the SCEF.\nIf the HSS, in step 4 above, decides to add Monitoring Event for indicated UEs (i.e. one individual UE or a sub-set of UEs) in the group of UEs for which there was a previously configured Monitoring Event, the HSS includes the External Identifier or MSISDN of these indicated UEs towards the SCEF.\n11.\tFor single UE processing (if the SCEF received the T8 Set Suggested Network Configuration Response without an External Group Identifier), the SCEF sends a T8 Set Suggested Network Configuration Response (TLTRI, Maximum Response Time (if modified), Maximum Latency (if modified), Suggested Number of Downlink Packets (if modified), Cause) message to the SCS/AS. If the SCEF or HSS modified any of the parameters that were provided in step 1, the modified values are provided to the SCS/AS. If the SCEF discarded any of the parameters that were provided in step 1, the cause value indicates which values were discarded.\nFor group based processing, SCEF sends a T8 Set Suggested Network Configuration Response (TLTRI Maximum Response Time (if modified), Maximum Latency (if modified), Suggested Number of Downlink Packets (if modified), Cause, list of (External Identifier or MSISDN, Cause)) with the accumulated responses received from the HSS in step 10. If the SCEF or HSS modified any of the parameters that were provided in step 1, the modified values are provided to the SCS/AS. If the SCEF discarded any of the parameters that were provided in step 1, the cause value indicates which values were discarded.\n12.\tIf the SCEF received Cancelled SCEF Reference ID in step 10 or 10a, the steps 2-5 of Network-initiated Explicit Monitoring Event Deletion procedure defined in clause 5.6.9 are performed with the TLTRI corresponding to the Cancelled SCEF Reference ID.",

When the SCS is part of the operator domain (figure A-1 C and figure A-2), the SCS is considered a mobile operator internal network function, is operator controlled, and may provide operator value-added services. In this case, security and privacy protection for communication between the MTC-IWF and SCS is optional. When the SCS is deployed outside the operator domain (figure A-1 B and A-2), the SCS is MTC Service Provider controlled. In this case, security and privacy protection for communication between the MTC-IWF and SCS is needed. In the direct model (figure A-1 A), there may not be an external or internal SCS in the communication path.\nFigure A-1: Deployment scenarios for direct and indirect model\nFigure A-2: Deployment scenarios for hybrid model\nAn operator may deploy the hybrid model with a combination of no internal and external SCS (as in the Direct Model) and internal and/or external SCS (as in the Indirect Model). As shown in Figure A-2, a UE may be in communications with multiple SCSs in an HPLMN which can be made up of a combination of operator controlled and MTC service provider controlled SCSs. In that scenario, the MTC Service provider controlled SCS, and the 3GPP operator controlled SCS may offer different capabilities to the MTC Applications.\nThough not illustrated, it is also possible that the deployment of an AS may be inside the operator domain and under operator control.\nAnnex B (informative):Void\nAnnex C (informative):Triggering with OMA Push\nC.1\tGeneral\nThe 3GPP Device Trigger function enables a transport of application defined triggers to be delivered from a Service Capability Server (SCS) towards the UE. One defined application trigger framework is OMA Push Architecture [20]. OMA Push defined messages can be carried as payload in the Device Trigger message.\nC.2\tTriggering flow using Service Loading\nFigure C.2-1: Triggering flow using OMA Push\n1.\tThe SCS generates content (e.g. an MTC application specific command) and a URI towards the content (or receives a URI towards content from another source) and then the SCS (performing OMA Push Proxy Gateway functionality) generates a Push Message [19] with the PDU set according to Service Loading [17], and sends a trigger request over Tsp according to clause 5.2.1.\n2.\tThe MTC-IWF receives the trigger request and sends it according to clause 5.2.1.\n3.\tThe UE SMS dispatcher receives the SMS and routes it to the OMA Push Client which has registered for the triggering routing identifier (e.g. SMS Application port). The OMA Push Client, optionally validates the source (using whitelist defined in OMA Push Management Object [18]) and then forwards the trigger using the Application-Id (e.g. to the M2M Service Capability Layer).\n4.\tThe UE activates a PDP/PDN connection.\n5.\tThe content described as part of the URI is retrieved (retrieval of content is mandatory for content type Service Loading [17]).\n6.\tBased on the content retrieved the addressed Application may perform additional actions (e.g. the M2M Service Capability Layer may convey the information to an M2M Application addressed as part of the \"command\" retrieved, within the same or in a different physical device), but this is outside scope of 3GPP standardisation.\nAnnex D (informative):Device triggering using direct model over user plane\nThe following flow shows an example of device triggering using direct model over user plane. In this example, an application in the UE explicitly registers with a DT-AS/SCS (Device Trigger Application Server) in the home operator's network using an existing PDN connection (e.g. default PDN connection). The DT-AS uses the information from the application registration (such as IP address, port, protocol, etc.) to deliver the incoming device triggers, forwarded by another AS (e.g. third party AS) or itself, to the UE through the user plane. Once the UE receives the trigger, the UE either uses the existing PDN connection or the UE sets up a new PDN connection to the appropriate APN to contact the third-party Application Server.\nFigure D-1: Triggering flow using direct model over user plane\n1.\tThe UE/MTC application registers with the DT-AS in an operator's network using an existing PDN connection (for e.g. default PDN). The registration information, for example, could include the IPv4/IPv6 address and the port number where the application is reachable.\n2.\tThe DT-AS receives a trigger from a third-party AS to reach the UE.\n3.\tThe DT-AS delivers the trigger to the UE over the user plane.\n4.\tThe UE either uses the existing PDN connection or sets up a new PDN connection using the appropriate APN to contact the third-party AS.\nAnnex E (informative):Change history\nChange history\nDate\nMeeting\nTDoc\nCR\nRev\nCat\nSubject/Comment\nNew version\n2012-02\nSP-55\nSP-120095\n-\n-\n-\nMCC Update to version 1.0.0
