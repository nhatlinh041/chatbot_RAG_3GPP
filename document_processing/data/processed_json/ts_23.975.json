      "section_title": "Baseline Architecture for IPv4 and IPv6 Co-existence",
      "content": "This clause describes how dual-stack connectivity has been specified for the EPS and GPRS networks.\nThe Release 8 3GPP EPS architecture supports and optimises the co-existence of IPv4 and IPv6 with dual-stack operation. Dual-stack operation means that native IPv4 and native IPv6 packets are transported in parallel by tunnelling them from the UE to the PDN GW within a single EPS bearer/PDP context. This dual-stack EPS bearer/PDP context is associated with both an IPv4 address and an IPv6 prefix.\nIn comparison, dual stack connectivity to a given PDN in the pre-Release 9 GPRS network (with Gn/Gp SGSN and/or GGSN elements) requires the activation of two parallel PDP contexts, one for IPv4 traffic and one for IPv6 traffic. It should be noted that these parallel PDP contexts enable the same dual-stack connectivity for an application as the dual-stack EPS Bearers/PDP Contexts in the Release 8 EPS.\nFigure 4.1: EPS Non-roaming architecture for 3GPP accesses in Release 8\nFigure 4.1 depicts the Release 8 3GPP reference architecture for EPS according to TS 23.401 [9]. Upon request from the UE, the MME and S4-SGSN can activate a dual-stack EPS bearer/PDP context, which is identified in signalling by the PDN/PDP type 'v4v6'. A dual-stack EPS bearer tunnels IPv4 and IPv6 traffic in parallel from the UE to PDN GW.\nIn order to support dual-stack connectivity where possible, it has been specified in the Release 8 EPS specifications TS 23.401 [9], TS 23.060 [11], that if a Release 8 UE/MS supports both IPv4 and IPv6, the UE/MS shall always start off by requesting for a dual-stack (PDN/PDP type v4v6) bearer. It is also assumed that the UE/MS has no knowledge of the IPv4 and/or IPv6 capabilities of a given PDN. Neither does the UE/MS have any awareness of whether dual-stack bearers/ contexts are supported by the network to which it is attaching.\nIn Release 8, the EPS control plane elements (MME, S4-SGSN) and user plane elements (SGW, PGW) are all able to identify and handle requests to activate a dual-stack bearer/ context, and to enforce the type of bearers/ contexts that are allocated to the UE/MS. The network may downgrade the request for the PDN/PDP type v4v6 if a given PDN supports/allows only one of the address types (i.e. IPv4 or IPv6) as configured in the HSS. This limitation may stem from an operator policy. Another reason for downgrading may be that there are Gn/Gp SGSNs in the operator's network that have not been upgraded to support the PDP type 'v4v6'. The outcome of a PDN/PDP Type request depends on HSS provided subscription data, PGW configuration and home (and possibly visited) network core configuration. Any of these factors may downgrade the request to a single address type.\nThe EPS interworking architecture for Gn/Gp SGSNs is shown in Figure 4.2.\nFigure 4.2: EPS Non-roaming Architecture for interoperation with Gn/Gp SGSNs in Rel‑8\nDual stack PDP context support for the GPRS core network (GGSN, Gn/Gp SGSN) is specified in Release 9. To use this functionality a MS need to support Release 8 or higher (same as S4-SGSN access in EPS) in order to successfully request a PDP type 'v4v6' connection in UTRAN/GERAN. A pre-Release 9 Gn/Gp SGSN handles PDP type 'v4v6' as an 'unknown' PDP type, meaning that it handles a request for the PDP type 'v4v6' as if it were a request for the PDP type 'v4'.\nNOTE 1:\tThe 3GPP specification TS 24.008 [25] is not entirely unambiguous on the treatment of unknown PDP types. Even if the information element coding for \"PDP type\" specifies that a request for an \"unknown PDP type\" shall be treated as if it were a request for PDP type v4, the error signalling elsewhere in the specification include the possibility to signal an error code \"unknown PDP address or PDP type\".\nIn order to support inter-RAT mobility to/from a pre-Release 9 Gn/Gp SGSN, parallel v4 and v6 bearers/PDP contexts to a given PDN must to be used instead of dual-stack contexts.\nThe request to activate two parallel single stack bearers/PDP contexts is always initiated by the UE/MS. If the Release 8 network assigns a single-stack bearer to the UE/MS in response to a request for a dual-stack bearer, the network also signals to the UE/MS an indication on whether parallel single stack bearers are allowed to the same PDN or not. If the UE/MS fails to activate a dual-stack bearer/context, and it receives a single-stack IPv4 or IPv6 bearer/context, it shall attempt to activate a parallel single-stack bearer/context for the other IP address type to the same PDN, unless the UE has received an explicit indication from the network that parallel single stack bearers/contexts are not allowed.\nIn GPRS core networks, dual-stack connectivity is also possible with a pre-Release 9 GGSN and SGSN. These network elements do not support dual-stack PDP contexts, but dual-stack usage may be possible by activating a parallel IPv4 PDP context and IPv6 PDP context to the same PDN. In order to establish dual-stack connectivity in this case, a dual-stack UE shall attempt to open parallel single-stack v4/v6 PDP contexts to the same PDN even without receiving an explicit indication on support for parallel single stack bearers to the same PDN.\nFor end-hosts, the activation and mobility of dual-stack bearers/ contexts is simpler in comparison to handling of parallel IPv4 and IPv6 bearers/contexts. The usage of dual stack bearers/ contexts also simplifies the handling of parallel IPv4 and IPv6 traffic within the network after early EPS deployment phase when SGSNs are upgraded to support the PDP type 'v4v6'.\nTR 23.981 [14] describes a scenario where old SGSNs do not support PDP type IPv6. Considering the fact that PDP type IPv6 has been specified since R'97 and SGSNs shipped during the last couple of years have support for PDP type IPv6, the assumption is that all SGSNs support PDP type IPv6.",

      "content": "In this IPv6 transition scenario, the operator runs the user plane in dual stack mode, i.e., the UEs are assigned both an IPv6 prefix and an IPv4 address in order to allow UEs to utilise both IPv4 and IPv6 capable applications. This scenario relies on the availability of dual-stack UEs, which are able to support parallel IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity to a single PDN. It is further assumed that the proportion of IPv6 capable applications will start to increase as soon as UEs and networks starts to become dual-stack capable. As popular services start to support IPv6, a part of IPv4 traffic will gradually be offloaded into the IPv6 domain. Services that are operator owned and deployed (for example LTE voice and other IMS based services) could be IPv6 enabled (in addition to IPv4) and hence accessible by the dual-stack capable UEs.\nDuring transition phase, the depletion of public IPv4 addresses may become an issue in some operators' networks. The lack of public IPv4 address availability in the near future will inhibit the growth of data services and mobile broadband networks. The shortage of public addresses will be aggravated by always-on packet data connectivity, which is expected to prevail in newer network deployments.\nTo alleviate the shortage of public IPv4 addresses, the usage of private IPv4 addresses can be considered (e.g. the RFC 1918 [26] addresses). The utilisation of private IPv4 addresses should not require new procedures to be specified for the UE in order to ensure maximum applicability in a network with an early dual-stack UE population.",

      "content": "This migration scenario is based on the Dual stack model: The operator assigns both an IPv6 prefix and an IPv4 address to UEs in order to ensure that both IPv4 and IPv6 capable applications can be utilised.\nThe IPv4 addresses assigned to UEs are taken from one of the private address ranges as specified in RFC 1918 [26]. To enable global connectivity, network address translation (NAT) is performed on the (S)Gi interface for IPv4 packets originated from or destined to the UEs.\nNOTE:\tDepletion of public IPv4 addresses while transitioning to IPv6 might be one reason for operators to assign private as opposed to public IPv4 addresses to UEs.\nThe challenge of this scenario lies in the limited number of private IP addresses. In case more than 16 million UEs are active (i.e. have an active PDP context/EPS bearer) in the same network at the same time, the network will run out of private IPv4 addresses. In order to avoid this, the operator may have to consider assigning the same IPv4 address to multiple UEs. Nevertheless, the operator expects that legacy IPv4 applications continue to work in this situation.\nWhen defining solutions for this scenario, it additionally needs to be taken into account that in existing deployments some operators currently use the private IPv4 address assigned to a given UE to identify the respective customer (note that for this reason private IPv4 addresses are currently unique within these networks). Therefore, a solution for this scenario needs to ensure that IPv4 flows on the Gi interface can be uniquely traced back to a given UE/customer.",

Real port usage is determined by the user applications and their need for connections which could range from one to several thousands per user. Offloading these IPv4 resources by moving the traffic to IPv6 will end up freeing a significant amount of public IPv4 addresses that can be used elsewhere in the operator network.\nThe use of traditional NAT has a size limitation due to the maximum 16 million available RFC 1918 [26] private IPv4 addresses.

When communicating with Services/peers only served by IPv4, the UE/MS will use NAPT44 resources to enable communication.

It looks evident for time being that a single or even a small cluster of PGWs implementing collocated NAPT44 functions should not run out of RFC 1918 [26] addresses for one APN.

This deployment model is actually the same what was already illustrated in Figure 7.1.3 and 7.1.4. If the service infrastructure needs to distinguish between subscribers with overlapping RFC 1918 [26] addresses but still only compare IP addresses, then the comparison has to include additional information or be context aware of the source of the used RFC 1918 [26] pool.\nFor example, beyond knowledge of the NAT binding state to derive the private IPv4 address, the comparison could also take the public IP address of the GGSN/PGW into account where the NAPT44 takes place. If there need to be traffic inspecting devices within each PDN of Figure 4 with overlapping RFC 1918 [26] addresses then the IP address of the traffic inspecting device could be used to identify the PDN where the RFC 1918 [26] pool belongs to.\nOther solutions are also possible.

This can be arranged either by using a dual stack connection by requesting a connection of PDP Type IPv4v6 or PDN Type IPv4v6 depending on radio access technology and MS/UE capability. If these dual stack are not possible to obtain it is also possible to request two separate connections, one PDP context/PDN connection Type IPv4 and one PDP context/PDN connection Type IPv6 in parallel to the same dual-stack APN. The preferred way would be to use only one connection for both IP versions but the two connection approach could be used due when ether MS/UE or core does not allow for a single dual stack PDP context connection to be established.\nThe following table lists the basic requirements for this scenario in an IP version co-existence phase referencing the user plane capabilities only.\nTable 7.1.1: IPv4 offload requirements\nBasic Components Name\nStates\nPDP/PDN Types\nTerminal IP capability\nDual stack (IPv6 preferred over IPv4 if both can be used for a remote endpoint)\nIPv4v6, IPv4 and IPv6 (NOTE 1)\nType of application program\nDual stack capable\nnot applicable\nType of assigned IP address,\nIPv4 and IPv6\nnot applicable\nSubscriber IP capability\nDual stack APN in subscriber data\nIPv4v6, IPv4 and IPv6\nNetwork IP capability\nDual stack network\nIPv4v6, IPv4 and IPv6(NOTE 2)\nService/peer capability\nDual stack (NOTE 3)\nnot applicable\nThe GGSN/PDN GW IPv4 Internet connectivity is provided over a NAPT44 solution either co-located with the GGSN/PDN GW or elsewhere placed in the operator network.\nNOTE 1:\tTo be able to use PDP/PDN Type IPv4v6 the MS/UE need to be Release 8 or later.\nNOTE 2:\tTo be able to serve PDP/PDN Type IPv4v6 the core nodes need to be Release 8 or later except for SGSN/GGSN using Gn/Gp need to be Release 9.\nNOTE 3:\tIf DNS is to be used to resolve the service/peer FQDN into an IP address the node DNS information need to contain both A and AAAA record entries for the service/peer.",

The presented NAPT44 based solution and few other considerations are sufficient to support the migration period, more specifically to address the problems of limited private IPv4 address space.

      "content": "Gateway-Initiated Dual-Stack Lite [13] (GI-DS-lite) is a modified approach of the DS-Lite concept. The GI-DS-lite concept applies to EPC as well as GPRS. For reasons of simplicity, this clause uses EPC nomenclature. GPRS applies in a similar way.\nGI-DS-Lite builds on top of the current dual-stack deployment model of the 3GPP architecture which supports dual-stack UEs and uses tunnelling technology between the Serving Gateway and the PDN Gateway, over GTP or PMIPv6 based S5/S8 interfaces, and between the UE and the PDN Gateway over the S2c interface. GI-DS-Lite lifts some of the restrictions of the DS-lite solution:\n-\tCarrier Grade NAPT (CGN) does not need to be co-resident with PDN-Gateway.\n-\tNo added overhead for IPv4 user plane traffic transport on the airlink.\n-\tSupport of IPv4 and IPv6 transport networks.\n-\tSupport for deployments with public, private, and overlapping IPv4 addresses on the UEs.\n-\tNo UE changes mandated for any of the deployment scenarios.\nWith GI-DS-Lite, UE and access architecture remain unchanged. PDN Gateway and CGN are connected through a \"softwire\" identified by a Softwire ID (SWID). The SWID does not need to be globally unique, i.e. different SWIDs could be used to identify a softwire at the different ends of a tunnel. A Context-Identifier (CID) is used to multiplex flows associated with the UE onto the softwire tunnel. Local policies at the PDN Gateway determine which part of the traffic received from an UE is sent via a softwire to the CGN. The combination of CID and SWID serves as common context between PDN Gateway and CGN to identify flows associated with an UE. The CID is typically a 32-bit wide identifier assigned by the gateway. It is retrieved either from a local or remote (e.g. AAA) repository. The CID ensures a unique identification (potentially along with other traffic identifiers such as e.g. interface, VLAN, port, etc.) of traffic flows at the Gateway and CGN. The embodiment of the CID and SWID depends on the technology used and the type of the network connecting PDN Gateway and CGN.\nIf, for example GRE (RFC 2784 [27]) with \"GRE Key and Sequence Number Extensions\" (RFC 2890 [28]) is used as softwire technology, the network connecting PDN Gateway and CGN could be either IPv4-only, IPv6-only, or a dual-stack IP network. The GRE-key field represents the CID.\nIn case of MPLS VPN, RFC 4364 [20] used between PDN Gateway and CGN, the softwire identification is supplied by the VPN identifier of the MPLS VPN, whereas the IPv4 address serves as CID. Depending on if the PDN Gateway and CGN are connected as CEs or PEs, the VPN identifier could e.g. be an attachment circuit identifier (e.g.. a VLAN tag), a representation of the VPN route labels pointing to routes within the VPN, the VPN route distingisher etc. The combination of CID and SWID ensures a unique identification (potentially along with other traffic identifiers such as e.g. interface, VLAN, port, etc.) for traffic flows at the CGN, which should be associated with a single NAT-binding. Deployment dependent, the CID can also be used as an identifier for traffic flows or UEs in backend systems: Deployments which use non-overlapping private IPv4 addresses for the UE could e.g. choose to map private IPv4 addresses 1:1 to the CID.\nIn a GI-DS-Lite deployment, the CGN combines DS-Lite softwire termination and NAT44. The outer/external IPv4 address of a NAT-binding at the CGN is either assigned autonomously by the CGN from a local address pool, configured on a per-binding basis (either by a remote control entity through a NAT control protocol or through manual configuration), or derived from the CID (e.g. the 32-bit CID could be mapped 1:1 to an external IPv4-address). The choice of the appropriate translation scheme for a traffic flow can take parameters such as destination IP-address, incoming interface, etc. into account. The IP-address of the CGN, which, depending on the transport network between the PDN Gateway and the CGN, will either be an IPv6 or an IPv4 address, is configured on the gateway. A variety of methods, such as out-of-band mechanisms, or manual configuration apply.\nFigure 7.2.2a: Gateway-Initiated Dual-Stack Lite deployment scenario\nFigure 7.2.2a shows an example of Gateway-Initiated DS-Lite applied to the EPC architecture when S5 or S8 interfaces are used. The PDN Gateway associates the mobility tunnels with the DS-Lite softwire to facilitate traffic forwarding to and from the CGN.\nFigure 7.2.2b: Gateway-Initiated Dual-Stack Lite deployment scenario over S2c\nFigure 7.2.2b shows an example of Gateway-Initiated DS-lite applied to the EPC architecture when the S2c interface is used. The PDN Gateway associates the mobility tunnels with the softwire to facilitate traffic forwarding to and from the CGN.\nIn its simplest form, there could be a 1:1 relationship between mobile access tunnels (e.g. identified by a TEID or the DSMIPv6 HNP) and a combination of CID and SWID identifying the softwire facing the CGN - resulting in a simple tunnel-stitching operation on the PDN Gateway. Deployment dependent (e.g. for deployments which use non-overlapping private IP addresses on the UEs), the PDN Gateway could e.g. choose to only send Internet-bound traffic to the CGN - and route internal traffic locally.",

According to the scenario considered, the operator will assign a public IPv4 address or a private IPv4 address in addition to an IPv6 prefix. The operator can select one of the technical solutions described in clause 7 of this document.\nThe second strategy, consisting of providing the UE with IPv6-only connectivity, can be considered as a first stage or an ultimate target scenario for operators. The operator can use NAT64/DNS64 capability to access to IPv4-only services if access to IPv4 services is needed.\nAnnex A:Reference Scenarios for NAT in the EPC\nIPv6 migration may involve the use of NAT. The use of NAT in the EPC raises several issues, in particular as it relates to interactions with dynamic Policy and Charging Control (PCC). In this clause examines these issues. This annex only covers non-roaming scenarios. NAT related to roaming scenarios is not being considered in this TR. Note that while this annex focuses on NAT in EPC, the considerations in this annex apply for GPRS networks in a similar way.\nA.1\tUE and AF In the same Address Realm\nFigure A.1 and figure A.2 show scenarios where no NAT function exists between the AF and the UE, which is the typical deployment for e.g. IMS. NAT is employed beyond the AF. UE, PCC, and AF are all within the same addressing domain, hence NAT does not impact PCC services.\nFigure A.1: EPC with standalone NAT-function, Services in front of NAT\nFigure A.2: EPC with NAT-function integrated with the PDN-Gateway, Services in front of NAT\nA.2\tNAT between UE and AF\nScenarios in this clause cover non-roaming cases where the NAT function resides between the PDN Gateway and the Application Function. The basic scenario is illustrated in figure A.3 with a standalone NAT function, and in figure A.3 with a NAT function integrated with the PDN-Gateway.\nFigure A.3: Application Function Realm Traversal with Standalone NAT\nWhen the UE performs an Initial Attach, it is assigned an IP-address, A-1, by the PDN-Gateway in address realm 1. As part of the attach procedure, the PCRF is informed of the A-1 IP-address (or IPv6-prefix) assigned to the UE.\nSubsequently, the UE may invoke an Application Function, that resides in Address Realm 2. The UE uses an IP-Address and Port pair AP-1 for this application invocation.\nNOTE:\tThere may be more than one Address and Port pair, however for simplicity, we consider only one for now.\nThe associated IP datagrams traverse the NAT function, where they are translated to a new IP-Address and Port pair, AP-2, and the NAT-function performs the corresponding mapping. In case of a stateful NAT operation, a corresponding mapping is stored in the NAT function. The IP datagrams that reach the application function will thus contain AP-2 as the source IP-Address. AP-2 is possibly unknown to the UE. The AF may in turn interact with the PCRF to perform Policy and Charging Control (PCC) for the application.\nSeveral issues can be seen at this point:\n-\tThe Rx and Gx interface are crossing address realms and hence a mapping between the two will be necessary somewhere.\n-\tThe mapping between AP-1 and AP-2 is not done until the application is invoked.\n-\tThe mapping between AP-1 and AP-2 may not happen until sometime after the application has been invoked. For example, for applications that establish media streams (such as IMS using SIP/SDP), the corresponding mappings for the media streams may not be established until after the session is established, yet PCC interactions for the media streams are needed before that.\n-\tApplication Functions that use embedded IP-address information (e.g. AP-1) in application signalling need to deal with the implications of such address information crossing address realms.\nFigure A.4 - Application Function Realm Traversal with Integrated NAT\nThe scenario with integrated NAT shown in figure A.4 is very similar to figure A.3, and hence it raises many of the same issues.\nA.2.1\tOverlapping IPv4 address realms\nThe limited number of IPv4 addresses offered by even the largest private IPv4 address space (i.e., 10/8, which holds less than 2^24 or 16.8M addresses) implies a need for large operators with IPv4 enabled UEs to employ overlapping IPv4 address realms. The considerations within this clause build on top of those discussed above, i.e. the issues identified above apply to the scenarios with overlapping IPv4 address realms as well.\n-\tTwo scenarios are considered: Overlapping address realms exposed to a single PCRFfigure A.5 expands on the basic scenarios by introducing the notion of overlapping address realms (1a and 1b), where AP-1 (or A-1) may be assigned to and used by multiple UEs in the network, as long as those UEs reside in different address realms. This adds the issue that PCC may need to traverse address realms, however with overlapping IP address realms, there is now also a need to identify the correct address realm. Similarly, if the same NAT function is used between multiple address realms with overlapping IPv4 addresses, the NAT function (and possibly the network) needs to incorporate functionality to differentiate these different NAT address realms.\nFigure A.3 shows one possible scenario where the overlapping address realms are exposed to the PCRF. PCC-related issues of the overlapping address realms are shielded from the Application Function. If PCRF receives requests from the AF it needs to figure out which address realm (and P-GW) to interact with for Gx.\n-\tOverlapping address realms with individual PCRFs: Figure A.6 shows a scenario with two address realms with overlapping addresses. There is a PCRF for each address realm. From a NAT perspective, this scenario resembles the scenario shown in figure A.3. Additional considerations for the overlapping address realms are not required. The AF and/or DRA needs to follow the appropriate PCRF selection procedures to identify the appropriate PCRF.\nFigure A.5: Application Function Realm Traversal with Overlapping Address Realms on Gx\nFigure A.6: Application Function Realm Traversal with Overlapping Address Realms on Rx\nAnnex B:Overview of Solutions for IPv6 Transition\nB.1\tSolution 1 - Dual-Stack Lite Architecture\nB.1.1\tSolution 1 Description\nDual-Stack Lite architecture [2] can be understood as IPv4 packets being encapsulated using either IPv6 or some L2 technology. The tunnel endpoint is usually the Carrier Grade NAT (CGN). Since the hosts are not provisioned with an IPv4 address, they have to self-generate their own IPv4 address from the private IPv4 address pool. Thus, these self-generated IPv4 addresses may overlap, and packets from different hosts may arrive to the CGN with the same private IP address. The CGN differentiates hosts with same private IPv4 address based on information provided by encapsulation technology. When packets are destined to the IPv4 Internet, CGN will act as a NAT. Several options exist for deploying DS-Lite.\nThe encapsulation method can be chosen at least from the following set:\n-\tPlain IPv6: IPv4-in-IPv6 is the basic DS-Lite encapsulation scenario. In this scenario the UE encapsulates IPv4 packets into IPv6. The CGN can be a separate entity or integrated to e.g. PDN GW. Only an IPv6 bearer is needed.\n-\tGRE: When PMIP6 is used, the MAG can encapsulate IPv4 into GRE tunnel. CGN has to be implemented in LMA. No UE impact. A dual-Stack bearer is needed.\n-\tGTP: When GTP is used, PDN GW must implement CGN. No UE impact. A dual-Stack bearer is needed.\n-\tDSMIP6: The HA must implement CGN. Only an IPv6-bearer is needed. The UE must implement standard DSMIP6 support.\nThere are also other encapsulation methods, such as L2TP, but those are not included in this study.\nThe common feature of DS-lite is that all IPv4 communication from UEs will have to go through NAT functionality, even if traffic is destined to the operator's own services (no hairpinning is possible, as there is no IPv4 address allocation). Consequently DS-lite is best suited for IPv4 Internet access by legacy applications, which are able to initiate communication and connections. In such a deployment scenario, the majority of new applications and operator services would be accessed with IPv6.\nB.1.1.1\tPlain IPv6 encapsulation in 3GPP architecture\nWhen plain IPv6 encapsulation is used, DS-Lite can be deployed independently over existing 3GPP IPv6 access. The UE is required to be able to discover the CGN's IPv6 address (for example by using stateless DHCPv6), and then to encapsulate IPv4-over-IPv6 to the CGN, which does the decapsulation and network address translation. The CGN can be a stand-alone entity, or integrated into the PDN GW. The CGN differentiates UEs with same IPv4 address based on their globally unique IPv6 address. When using IPv6 encapsulation, it is enough to establish IPv6-only bearers to between the UE and PDN GW.\nKnown issues:\n-\tMTU: to avoid fragmentation and dropped packets MTUs must be configured properly. For IPv6 communication, the UE will use the default MTU of the bearer or the MTU advertised in Router Advertisements, while for IPv4 communication, the UE will use an MTU of (IPv6_MTU-20) bytes.\n-\tTunnelling overhead: an IPv6 header (128 bits) is added to each IPv4 packet.\n-\tIPv4 P2P communication: all IPv4 based communication, including P2P, must traverse through CGN.\n-\tQoS: 3GPP TFTs are limited in such a way that it is not possible to differentiate traffic based on information in the inner headers of a tunnel.\nKnown benefits:\n-\tSimple UE side implementation.\n-\tCan be deployed over existing 3GPP networks, with the known issues.\nB.1.1.2\tGRE encapsulation\nWhen PMIP6 is used for network based mobility, it is possible for the LMA to use GRE identifiers to differentiate between UEs. The CGN function must reside in the LMA, as it is the only entity capable of differentiating between UEs having the same IPv4 address. The MAG will need to differentiate UEs with same IPv4 address by some other identifier (such as the default bearer id). UEs do not need to be modified, as they are provided with native dual-stack connectivity. When using GRE encapsulation, a dual-stack bearer (or two single stack bearers) needs to be established between UE and MAG.\nKnown issues:\n-\tRequires support on the MAG and the LMA.\n-\tCannot be deployed into existing 3GPP networks.\n-\tIPv4 P2P communication, all IPv4 based P2P communication must traverse through CGN.\nKnown benefits:\n-\tNo UE changes mandated (but UEs may need to support some other encapsulation for other access technologies than 3GPP access)\n-\tInterworks with the existing QoS schemes.\n-\tNo tunnelling overhead over the air interface\nB.1.1.3\tGTP encapsulation\nA special case is the GTP based solution, where the PDN GW implements CGN and differentiates UEs based on the TEID It allows allocation of the same IPv4 address for all hosts. When using GTP encapsulation, a dual-stack bearer (or two single stack bearers) needs to be established between UE and MAG.\nKnown issues:\n-\tRequires support on the PDN GW.\n-\tCannot be deployed into existing 3GPP networks.\n-\tIPv4 P2P communication, all IPv4 based P2P communication must traverse through CGN.\nKnown benefits:\n-\tNo UE changes mandated (but UEs may need to support some other encapsulation for other access technologies).\n-\tInterworks with existing QoS schemes.\n-\tNo header overhead over the air interface.\nB.1.1.4\tDSMIP6\nWith DSMIP6, it is possible to provide session continuity during inter-technology handovers and at the same time provide an IPv6 transition solution. DSMIP6 can, by definition, always provide dual-stack connectivity independently of the address family of care-of address(es) obtained within the visited network. In case public IPv4 addresses are scarce, and private IPv4 address space is too small for ordinary IPv4 Network Address Translation to suffice, the DSMIP6 Home Agent could implement the CGN function and thus be able to allocate the same private IPv4 address for multiple UEs. A DSMIP6 HA behaving as a CGN can be seen as instance of Dual-Stack Lite architecture.\nKnown issues:\n-\tTunnelling overhead from the DSMIP6 header.\n-\tIPv4 P2P communication, all IPv4 based P2P communication must traverse through a CGN.\nKnown benefits:\n-\tThe UE does not need to implement anything special over standard DSMIP6 support\n-\tCan be deployed over existing 3GPP networks, with the known issues\n-\tQoS can be provided as currently.\nB.2\tSolution 2 - A+P architecture\nThe main principle of the IPv4 A+P solution (see [3][4]) is to assign the same IPv4 address (called Primary IPv4 Address) to several end-users' devices and to constraint the source port numbers to be used by each device. In addition to the assigned IPv4 address, an additional parameter, called Port Range, is also assigned to the customer's device.\nThis allows the allocation of the same public IPv4 address to multiple UEs, as they all will use different sets of ports. By doing so, the need for having NAT functionality in the network disappears.\nAs the IPv4 address is shared among multiple hosts, A+P addresses can only be used in point-to-point links (not in shared medium) and routing must be based on both the IP address and the port number. The entity that routes IP packets based on the port number is called a Port Range router (PRR).\nThe link between the UE and the PRR can use any encapsulation method, i.e. IPv6, GRE, GTP and DSMIP6.\nAs the UE has a limited set of ports which it is allowed to use, the UE must be modified to use allowed ports only. This can be realized e.g. by modifying the applications to deal with shared addresses, or having an internal NAT within the UE which translates between a self-generated private IPv4 address shown to the internal applications and the port restricted public IPv4 address received from network.\nFor outbound communications, a given port-restricted device proceeds according to its classical operations except for the constraint to control the source port number assignment so as to be within the assigned Port Range. The traffic is then routed without any modification inside the PLMN and delivered to its final destination.\nFor inbound communications, in the base IPv4 A+P variant, the traffic is trapped by the Port Range Router (PRR).\nB.2.4\tPort Range Router (PRR) function\nB.2.4.1\tGeneral\nAs mentioned above, a PRR function is required to be enabled in the data path so as to deliver incoming packets to the appropriate UE among those having the same IPv4 address.\nThis function may be embedded in current nodes or hosted by new nodes to be integrated in the PLMN, in particular a PRR function can be embedded in a GGSN, PDN GW, WIMAX ASN GW, 3GPP2 PDSN, etc.\nB.2.4.2\tPRR in binding mode\nIn binding mode, a PRR associates an IPv4 address and a port range with a specific identifier called routing identifier (e.g., GTP tunnel identifier, IPv6 address). This identifier is used to forward the packets to the suitable device among all those having the same IPv4 address. These associations are stored in a table referred to as port range binding table.\nThe routing identifier may be an IPv6 address belonging to the prefix assigned to the UE, or the GTP tunnel identifier.\nFigure B.2.5: A+P Flow Example\nIf an IPv6 address is used as a routing identifier, the PRR is not required to be co-located with GGSN. In such case, once the encapsulation is undertaken by the PRR, the appropriate GGSN/P-GW will receive the IPv4-in-IPv6 packets. Then, the GGSN/PDN GW proceeds to its \"normal\" operations in order to forward the IPv4-in-IPv6 packets to the appropriate UE: in particular, it uses the maintained IPv6 PDP context to relay those packets.\nB.2.4.3\tPRR in stateless mode\nIn addition to the binding mode defined in clause B.2.4.2, a stateless IPv6 A+P mode can be implemented as defined in IETF RFC 6346 [3]. In such mode, no port range binding table is required.\nIn this case, for incoming packets, the PRR encapsulates a received IPv4 packet in an IPv6 one using the following information:\n-\tThe destination IPv6 address is constructed using the shared IPv4 destination address and port number plus the IPv6 prefix which has been provisioned to the PRR. To do so, the PRR retrieves the destination IPv4 address and destination port number from the received IPv4 packet.\nNOTE:\tTo illustrate this behaviour, assuming that the PRR is provisioned with 2a01:c0a8::/29 as a prefix to build IPv4-Embedded IPv6 addresses, the IPv4 destination address equal to 193.51.145.206 and the port number equal to 19039 (0100101001011111), then the corresponding IPv6 address (which falls into a prefix assigned to the UE) is 2a01:c0aE:099C:8E72:52F8::/128\n2a01:c0a 1 11000001001100111001000111001110 0100101001011111 ::\n--------193.51.145.206---------  -----port-------\n-\tThe source IPv6 address is one of the global IPv6 addresses of the PRR.\nFor more information about the stateless mode, the reader is invited to refer to IETF RFC 6346 [3].\nB.2.6\tRequirement on UEs\nMobile UEs must be able to constrain their source port numbers and to use only source port numbers within the allocated Port Range. If an IPv4 packet is received by a given port-restricted UE, with a destination port number outside the assigned Port Range, the packet must be discarded. Furthermore, port-restricted UEs must be able to enforce configuration data received from the PLMN so as to constrain its Port Range.\nAccording to the enforced routing identifier mode (GTP tunnel or IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel), an encapsulation / de-capsulation function may be required. However, when GTP is used, no extra tunnelling technique is required to be supported by the UE. Nevertheless, if IPv4 packets are transported over IPv6, then the IPv4-in-IPv6 encapsulation/de-capsulation function is required.\nAs a conclusion:\n-\tit is mandatory to support port-restriction feature;\n-\tit is optional to support another tunnelling technique in addition to GTP.\nB.2.7\tUpdating legacy UEs\nFor the efficiency of public IPv4 address sharing, some of the legacy UEs may be updated to be port-restricted UEs owing to a software update. No operation is required in the hardware. For instance, some Linux-based mobile OSs such as Maemo supports the Iptables capabilities; the implementation of port restriction on the UE is then done with two command lines.\nNevertheless, from an operational perspective, updating UEs may not be obvious.\nB.2.8\tCo-existence with other transition techniques\nA+P can be deployed jointly with other IPv6 transition techniques such as DS-Lite. In particular, a DS-Lite AFTR (Address Family Translation Router) can delegate a set of port numbers to the UE to be used for \"push\" services. No NAT operation would be achieved by the CGN for delegated port numbers.\nB.2.9\tApplicability\nA+P can be deployed in several configuration schemes:\n-\tDual-Stack PDP context / bearer with a shared IPv4 address. The GTP tunnel identifier will be used by the PRR for forwarding incoming IPv4 packets;\n-\tSingle IPv6 PDP context / bearer: IPv4-in-IPv6 encapsulation is used to exchange IPv4 packets between the UE and the PRR,\n-\twith a binding table in the PRR (binding mode)\n-\twithout any binding table in the PRR (stateless mode)\nB.2.10\tEvaluation\nThe hard-partitioning of the port space reduces the efficiency of the A+P architecture. Ports-ranges assigned to a UE are no longer available for other UEs - even if these ports are not used. In consequence, the efficiency of A+P wrt IPv4 address utilization is less than with a centralised NAT functionality.\nKnown issues:\n-\tThe UE needs to be modified to support A+P scheme\n-\tThe gateway needs to forward not only based on IP address but based on address plus port. The network needs to implement PRR in similar places as CGN in the DS-Lite approach\n-\tThe backend RADIUS system needs to be changed as subscribers can no longer be identified by IP address only, but by IP address and port\n-\tIn the IPv6 tunnelling approach QoS differentiation between bearers cannot be provided easily\n-\tThe solution works only with applications using transport protocols, which have concept of port numbers (such as UDP and TCP). There will be challenges with protocols which use plain IP.\n-\tThe solution sets restrictions to applications within in the UE, as the allocation of fixed port numbers becomes more complicated.\n-\tFor ICMP messages, the UE must use an ICMP query identifier within the allocated port range, otherwise the response will not be received by this UE.\nKnown benefits:\n-\tThe UE has access to public IPv4 address, which simplifies the behaviour for P2P applications such as VoIP.\n-\tAllows IPv4 lifetime extension if used with GTP/GRE.\n-\tLegal requirements for tracing which traffic flow was originated from which UE is simpler than in CGN solutions, as the operator does not need to store each flow but only A+P allocation information.\n-\tIn GTP/GRE/DSMIP6 based solutions QoS can be provided.\n-\tA+P allows for an incremental migration to IPv6-only network\n-\tA+P can be fully stateless when used together with IPv6\n-\tNo per-state sessions are maintained in the PLMN realm\n-\tUnlike NAT44/NAT64, no dynamic state synchronization is required to ensure service robustness\n-\tNo ALG is required to be implemented in the service/PLMN realm\n-\tNo extra-cost on the UE to support NAT traversal techniques is required\n-\tUnlike double NAT solutions, peer-to-peer services can be delivered with one exception as documented in [23]\n-\tNo Keep-alive messages are required to maintain NAT entries. This characteristic mitigates battery consumption issues induced by \"Always-on\" services. Especially, the use of short intervals between keep-alive messages has a big impact on the battery consumption (See [24] for more details about complications to tweak UDP timers in NAT devices and also keep-alive intervals used by UE). Moreover, the network load is more optimized since the load induced by keep-alive messages in the context of CGN solutions is avoided.\n-\tLatencies and related problems of NATs are avoided.\nB.3\tSolution 3 - Protocol translation\nTranslation of IPv6 communication to IPv4 communication, and vice versa, is one way of providing connectivity between IP address families, see [5], [6], [7], [8]. If an UE would be strictly IPv6-only, it would be enough to have stateless or stateful NAT64 function in a network to provide access to IPv4-only destinations. However, as the UE is probably going to be running IPv4-only applications as well, a fully network based solution is not possible.\nA host based translation approach enables the usage of IPv4-only applications on a UE which only has IPv6 access connectivity. Essentially, the UE implements protocol translation from IPv4 to IPv6 (NAT46), and thus all communications sent by the UE is IPv6-only. An IPv6-to-IPv4 translation (NAT64) is needed in the network for those cases where the destination happens to be in IPv4-only domain. However, if the destination has IPv6-connectivity, only NAT46 translation is needed within the UE.\nKnown issues:\n-\tRequires protocol translation implementation within the UE\n-\tALGs are required in the UE to allow IPv4-embedding IPv4-only applications to communicate (such as FTP/SIP).\nKnown benefits:\n-\tDirect point-to-point connectivity is possible, as IPv6 packets do not need to traverse via CGN\n-\tAllows IPv4-only applications to access IPv6-only destinations without any translation taking place within the network.\n-\tLess MTU problems due to the avoidance of a tunnel header\n-\tCan be deployed in current 3GPP networks/technologies, as 3GPP network would consider all traffic IPv6-only (IPv4 awareness is only at edges)\n-\tQoS can be provided as currently\nB.4\tSolution 4 - Per-interface NAT44\nB.4.1\tOverview\nPer-Interface NAT44 (also known as Dual Stack Extra Lite) is a technique that relies on Layer 2 information for de-multiplexing NAT operations, as described in IETF RFC 6619 [19]. When applied to 3GPP networks, a NAT function can be embedded in the GGSN and/or P-GW, and UEs may be configured with the same IPv4 address. If NAPT44 is co-located with GGSN/PDN GW the NAT state can use the identity of the MS/UE mobility tunnel instead of the MS/UE assigned IPv4 address for managing the NAT session bindings. Packets are then translated and forwarded to their destination (either internal or external). Distinct pools may be configured on the GGSN depending on the APN. This procedure can be implemented in single stack PDP context / EPS bearers or in dual stack PDP contexts / EPS bearers. Since this approach allows UEs to be configured with the same IPv4 address, it resembles GI-DS-lite, as described in clause 7.2, but with the CGN collocated with PDN GW and without softwire tunnel. The approach is illustrated in Figure 7.Y.1 allows each MS/UE to use the same private IPv4 address range.\nFigure B.4.1: Per-Interface NAT. Overlapping RFC 1918 [26] address space for the same APN with per-interface (PDN Connection) basis NAT binding\nB.4.2\tEvaluation\nKnown issues of the solution:\n-\tThe session binding between private and public IPv4 address/port is not known to the PCC architecture. Therefore, depending on deployment and if the application is NAT aware and has access to the binding (as e.g. in the case of IMS), there may or may not be issues with applying PCC to the session.\n-\tGeneral NAT concerns, not specific to 3GPP networks, apply. For example, applications that embed IP addresses in the payload and are not NAT aware require additional functionality to work across NATs.\nKnown benefits of the solution\n-\tThis solution requires no changes to UEs, it can be used with legacy dual-stack UEs.\n-\tThis solution has no impact to the 3GPP network architecture, no new interface or network element is needed. It can be deployed without any additional normative specification within 3GPP. The existing bearer and session management procedures can be used without any change. The limitations described under \"known issues\" above apply.\n-\tThis solution does not introduce any additional tunnelling overhead on any interfaces.\n-\tThis solution with the appropriate deployment supports UEs with overlapping address space, thus there is no limitation of the number of subscribers.\n-\tSupport for UEs with public, private, and overlapping private IPv4 addresses. If so desired, all the UE's in the mobility domain can be assigned the same IPv4 private address.\n-\tNo changes to the IPv4 / IPv6 address-assignment procedures required.\n-\tNo bearing on the type of transport network: Transport network can be IPv4 or IPv6.\n-\tSolution to the public IPv4 address exhaustion problem through the use of NAPT44.\n-\tSolution to the private IPv4 address exhaustion problem through the use of overlapping private IPv4 addresses.\n-\tThis solution does not have any impact on the UE's roaming support.\n-\tNo impact on QoS/bearer procedures between UE and PDN GW/SGW/GGSN.\nB.4.3\tApplicability\nThis solution applies to scenario 1.\nThis approach also suggests solutions to address scenario 2, based on similar considerations as described in 7.1.2.2.3.\nGiven the solution description above, the described functionality can be configured in currently deployed mobile networks as well as in future deployments regardless of 3GPP access technology. When to deploy such a setup in an operator's network is more of a business and operational decision.\nB.5\tVoid\nB.6\tVoid\nB.7\tSolution 7 - BIH/NAT64\nB.7.1\tOverview\nDuring IPv6 migration, the network may only provide IPv6 only for reasons such as simplify the maintenance and reduce the management cost. However, it is not easy to mandate all the applications in the UE to update to support IPv6 in the first place. Therefore, the IPv4 applications in the UE are expected to still be able to access IPv4/IPv6 services.\nThe BIH/NAT64 solutions described here combines the BIH [7] module in the host and a NAT64 GW on the network side. The solution addresses the following scenarios:\n1)\tThe legacy IPv4 applications which reside in the host could continue to run and access IPv4 services through an IPv6 only network.\n2)\tIPv6 applications access IPv4 services/peers.\n3)\tThe IPv4 applications which reside in the host could access the IPv6 servers/Peers.\nThe BIH in the host translates the IPv4 application's packets into IPv6 and the NAT64 translates IPv6 packets into IPv4 and vice versa. Such process can be depicted in Figure B.7.1.\nFigure B.7.1: Scenarios that BIH/NAT64 can address\nB.7.2\tSolution Description\nThe network architecture of deploying BIH/NAT64 in EPS is illustrated in Figure B.7.2. There are mainly two entities involved, e.g., BIH host/UE and NAT64.\nFigure B.7.2: The architecture of BIH/NAT64\nThe BIH host is a dual stack with the BIH module in it. It is could be either enhanced BIA (RFC 3338 [29]) or BIS (RFC 2767 [30]) and, in both cases, the Extension Name Resolver (ENR) [7] is introduced to intercept and properly synthesis DNS queries.\nNAT64 can be standalone or be collocated with PGW. DNS64 is not required, while, BIH has ENR module inside the host which does similar thing to DNS64.\nFrom the above, BIH/NAT64 is essentially a solution which leverages existing BIA/BIS and combines NAT64.\nB.7.3\tService Flow Example\nThe procedures of an IPv4 application in a BIH enabled host accessing IPv4 services through IPv6 only connection are illustrated in Figure B.7.3.\nFigure B.7.3: IPv4 application in a BIH enabled host access IPv4 services\nThe detail information flows are described as below.\n1)\tAfter bearer activation the UE was assigned an IPv6 address.\n2)\tThe IPv4 application in the BIH UE would like to start the communication. The DNS resolver in the UE may send a type A DNS query.\n3)\tThe BIH module will intercept that query and converts it to both type A and type AAAA queries and send it the DNS system.\n4,5) The DNS system may return a type A or type AAAA DNS query response. BIH module will intercept the DNS response message and may need to convert the type AAAA DNS response to type A DNS response or just return the DNS response to the IPv4 application(in case of received DNS response is type A).\n6,7) BIH module translates the application's IPv4 packets into IPv6 packets, BIH module creates the destination address by combine either WKP (Well Known Prefix) or NAT64 prefix together with a 32 bit IPv4 address. The source address will be network assigned IPv6 prefix.\n8)\tThe NAT64 receives IPv6 packets. It will translate it into IPv4 packet and sent it to the IPv4 network.\n9,10,11)\tThe IPv4 server response with IPv4 packet, the NAT64 gateway translates it into IPv6 and the IPv6 bearer carry the IPv6 packet to the UE. The BIH module translates will then translate it into IPv4 and forward it to the IPv4 application, I.\nTo let IPv6 applications access IPv4 services, the ENR in a BIH enabled host will compose an AAAA response based on a type A response (e.g., WKP/NAT64 prefix + the IPv4 address of the service). The IPv6 packet will be sent out with the source address being the UE's IPv6 prefix and the destination address being the one generated by ENR. The packet will be routed to the NAT64, translated to IPv4 packet and forwarded to the IPv4 servers/peers.\nB.7.4\tEvaluation\nThe Application Level Gateway (ALG) function only needs to invoke in the NAT64 to support applications embedding IP address in the payload.\nSince BIH/NAT64 employs NAT64 and enhances BIA/BIS, therefore, the solution shares similar issues and benefits with NAT64.\nKnown issues of the solution:\n-\tUE is required to install the BIH module, which may increase the complexity of the UE.\n-\tThe impact of BIH to the UE's CPU utilization and its OS is FFS.\n-\tThe impact to PCC with the deploying BIH/NAT64 is for FFS.\n-\tIn case of roaming with Local Breakout (PGW/GGSN in VPLMN), if there is a need to reach IPv4-only services, the VPLMN operator would be required to deploy NAT64 in order to provide the same user experience using IPv6-only connections for IPv4-only services as in non-roaming scenarios.\nKnown benefits of the solution:\n-\tThis solution allows IPv4-only applications running on an IPv6 network to communicate with IPv4, dual stack and IPv6 servers.\n-\tThe packet overhead is less compared with DS-Lite plain IPv6 encapsulation solutions.\nB.7.5\tApplicability\nThe solution only requires IPv6 only connection and can support IPv4 legacy applications. Therefore, it applies to the following IPv6 migration scenarios outlined in clause 5:\n-\tScenario 1: Dual-stack connectivity with Limited Public IPv4 Address Pools\n-\tScenario 2: Dual Stack connectivity with Limited Private IPv4 Address Pools\n-\tScenario 3: UEs with IPv6-only connection and applications using IPv6\n-\tScenario 4: IPv4 applications running on a Dual-stack host with an assigned IPv6 prefix and a shared IPv4 address and having to access IPv4 services\nAnnex C:Building Block: Dual-Stack EPS Bearer Contexts in EPS/GPRS\nC.1\tDescription\nRelease 8 specifications TS 23.401 [9], TS 23.060 [11] introduce dual-stack EPS bearer contexts to the EPS and GPRS networks, offering a basic cellular layer feature, which not only enables connectivity to IPv4 and IPv6 PDNs but also simplifies the process of migrating from IPv4 to IPv6 in the network. Dual stack bearer contexts are able to transport native IPv4 and native IPv6 packets within one PDN connection/PDP context. Dual-stack bearer contexts are identified in EPS/GPRS signalling by PDN/PDP type 'v4v6'.\nThe usage of dual-stack bearer contexts omits the need for opening parallel PDN connections/PDP contexts for different IP address family types. This is an advantage during a phased transition to IPv6 within networks, where PDNs need to support legacy applications using IPv4 whilst other applications have already been upgraded to support IPv6.\nFrom Release 8 onwards, the support for dual-stack bearer contexts is mandatory for E-UTRAN/UTRAN/GERAN terminals, which support both IPv4 and IPv6 addressing.\nC.2\tFunctional Description\nIt is specified in Release 8 EPS and GPRS specifications TS 23.401 [9], TS 23.060 [11], a Release 8 UE, which has both IPv4 and IPv6 capability, shall always initiate the activation of a PDN connection/PDP context by requesting for a dual-stack (PDN/PDP type v4v6) bearer. The UE is not assumed to have knowledge of the IPv4 and/or IPv6 capabilities of a given PDN. The UE also has no awareness of whether dual-stack bearer contexts are supported by the network to which it is attaching.\nThe EPS/GPRS network is required to handle requests for dual-stack EPS bearer contexts from the UE and to enforce the type of bearer contexts that are allocated to it. The network may downgrade the request for PDN/PDP type v4v6 for one of the following reasons:\n-\tA given PDN supports/allows only one of the address types i.e. IPv4 or IPv6. This limitation may stem from operator policy.\n-\tAll GnGp SGSNs in the operator's network have not been upgraded to support PDP type v4v6. In this case, parallel v4 and v6 bearers contexts to a PDN need to be used instead, so that inter-RAT mobility to/from GnGp SGSNs is possible.\nIn Release 8, all EPS control plane entities (MME ,S4-SGSN) and user plane entities (SGW, PGW) are able to identify and handle requests to activate a dual-stack bearer context. Dual stack bearer context support for the GPRS core network (GGSN, Gn/Gp SGSN) is specified in Release 9. A pre-Release 9 Gn/Gp SGSN handles PDP type v4v6 as an 'unknown' PDP type, meaning that it handles a request for PDP type v4v6 as if it were a request for PDP type 'v4'. A pre-Release 9 GGSN does not support dual-stack bearer contexts, but dual-stack usage requires the activation of parallel IPv4 and IPv6 bearer contexts to a PDN.\nIf the UE fails to activate a dual-stack bearer context, and it receives a single-stack IPv4 or IPv6 bearer context, it may attempt to activate a parallel single-stack bearer context for the other IP address type to the same PDN. The Release 8 network may explicitly signal to the UE an error cause that parallel single stack bearers are allowed to the same PDN.\nParallel PDP contexts to a single PDN may also be supported in GPRS networks where PDP type v4v6 is unknown. Therefore, in order to ensure dual-stack connectivity for this case, a UE which first attempted to open a dual-stack bearer context should attempt to open parallel single-stack v4/v6 PDP contexts to the same PDN even without receiving an explicit error cause.\nC.3\tInformation flows\nThe information flows depicting the activation and mobility of dual-stack bearer contexts are included in specifications TS 23.401 [9], TS 23.060 [11].\nC.4\tApplicability\nIn many network deployments, the usage of dual-stack bearer contexts in the network will be the initial method used to begin the transition from IPv4 to IPv6.\nThe usage of dual-stack bearer contexts has the advantage of offering parallel support of IPv4 and IPv6 addressing within one bearer context. This is a simple solution for end hosts in comparison to handling the activation and mobility of a parallel bearer. Importantly, dual stack bearer contexts offers simplified handling of parallel IPv4 and IPv6 traffic within the network after early EPS deployment phase, when upgraded GPRS core network elements can also be expected to support dual-stack bearer contexts.\nThe usage of dual-stack bearers during IPv6 transition does not address the shortage or IPv4 addresses, which has been identified as challenge in some IPv6 migration scenarios. However, the usage of dual-stack bearer contexts is an integral part of several IPv6 transition solutions, which also address IPv4 address conservation/re-use. An advantage of using dual-stack bearers within the context of IPv4 address conservation/re-use is that full support for QoS differentiation is already available in Release 8 based UEs.\nAnnex D:Change history\nChange history\nDate\nTSG #\nTSG Doc.\nCR\nRev\nSubject/Comment\nNew\n2011-06\nSP-52\n-\n-\n-\nMCC Update to version 11.0.0 after TSG SA approval\n11.0.0\n2014-09\nSP-65\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-12 version (MCC)\n12.0.0\n2015-12\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-13 version (MCC)\n13.0.0\n2017-03\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-14 version (MCC)\n14.0.0\n2017-09\nSP-77\nSP-170723\n0001\n1\nUpdate IETF IPv6 related reference of 23.975\n14.1.0\n2018-06\nSP-80\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-15 version (MCC)\n15.0.0\n2020-07\nSP-88E\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-16 version (MCC)\n16.0.0\n2022-03\nSP-95E\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-17 version (MCC)\n17.0.0\n2024-03\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-18 version (MCC)\n18.0.0",
