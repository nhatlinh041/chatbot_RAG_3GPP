      "content": "An HTTP request may be redirected to a different LMF service instance, within the same LMF or a different LMF of an LMF set, e.g. when an LMF service instance is part of an LMF (service) set or when using indirect communications (see 3GPP TS 29.500 [4]). See also the ES3XX feature in clause 6.2.9.\nAn SCP that reselects a different LMF producer instance will return the NF Instance ID of the new LMF producer instance in the 3gpp-Sbi-Producer-Id header, as specified in clause 6.10.3.4 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].\nIf an LMF within an LMF set redirects a service request to a different LMF of the set using an 307 Temporary Redirect or 308 Permanent Redirect status code, the identity of the new LMF towards which the service request is redirected shall be indicated in the 3gpp-Sbi-Target-Nf-Id header of the 307 Temporary Redirect or 308 Permanent Redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9.1 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].\nAnnex A (normative):OpenAPI specification\nA.1\tGeneral\nThis Annex specifies the formal definition of the Nlmf Service APIs. It consists of an OpenAPI 3.0.0 specification, in YAML format.\nThis Annex takes precedence when being discrepant to other parts of the specification with respect to the encoding of information elements and methods within the API(s).\nNOTE:\tThe semantics and procedures, as well as conditions, e.g. for the applicability and allowed combinations of attributes or values, not expressed in the OpenAPI definitions but defined in other parts of the specification also apply.\nInformative copies of the OpenAPI specification files contained in this 3GPP Technical Specification are available on a Git-based repository, that uses the GitLab software version control system (see 3GPP TS 29.501 [5] clause 5.3.1 and 3GPP TR 21.900 [7] clause 5B).\nA.2\tNlmf_Location API\nopenapi:
