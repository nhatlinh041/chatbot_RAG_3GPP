Only if a receiver has sufficient information, if a conditional IE, which is necessary for the receiving entity to complete the procedure, is missing, then the receiver shall abort the procedure.\n-\tConditional-Optional: this means that:\n-\tthe IE shall be included by a sending entity complying with the version of the specification, if the conditions specified in the relevant protocol specification are met. An entity, which is at an earlier version of the protocol and therefore is not up-to-date, cannot send this IE;\n-\tthe receiver need not check the presence of the IE in the message.

Therefore, the IE may be included or not in a message. The handling of an absent optional IE, or an erroneous optional IE is specified in clause 7.6.\nFor conditional Ies, the clause describing the URCMP message explicitly defines the conditions under which the inclusion of each IE becomes mandatory or optional for that particular message.

The definition might reference other protocol specifications for final terms used as part of the condition.\nFor grouped Ies, the presence requirement of the embedded IE shall follow the rules:\n-\tIf the grouped IE is Mandatory within a given message: the presence requirements of individual embedded Ies are as stated within the Mandatory grouped IE for the given message;\n-\tif the grouped IE is Conditional within a given message: if the embedded IE in the grouped IE is Mandatory or Conditional, this embedded IE is viewed as Conditional IE by the receiver.

If the embedded IE in the grouped IE is Optional, this embedded IE is viewed as Optional IE by the receiver;\n-\tif the grouped IE is Conditional-Optional within a given message: if the embedded IE in the grouped IE is Mandatory or Conditional, this embedded IE is viewed as Conditional-Optional IE by the receiver. If the embedded IE in the grouped IE is Conditional-Optional, this embedded IE is viewed as Optional IE by the receiver. If the embedded IE in the grouped IE is Optional, this embedded IE is viewed as Optional IE by the receiver;\n-\tif the grouped IE is Optional within a given message: all embedded Ies in the grouped IE are viewed as Optional Ies by the receiver.\nIn all of the above cases, appropriate error handling as described in clause 7.6 shall be applied for protocol errors of the embedded Ies.\nOnly the Cause IE at message level shall be included in the response if the Cause contains a value that indicates that the request is not accepted, regardless of whether there are other mandatory or conditional Ies defined for a given response message.",
