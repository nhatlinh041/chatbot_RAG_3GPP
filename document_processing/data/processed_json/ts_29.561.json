The IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix is assigned either at subscription in which case it is a static address or at PDU session establishment in which case it is a dynamic address. This IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix if applicable is used for packet forwarding between the Internet and the UPF and within the 5GS. With IPv6, Stateless Address Autoconfiguration shall be used to assign an IPv6 address to the UE. These procedures are as described in the IPv6 non-transparent access case except that the addresses belong to the operator addressing space.\n-\tthe UE need not send any authentication request at PDU session establishment procedure and the SMF/UPF need not take any part in the user authentication/authorization process.\nThe transparent case provides at least a basic ISP service. As a consequence of this it may therefore provide a QoS flow service for a tunnel to a private Intranet. The user level configuration may be carried out between the UE and the intranet, the 5GS is transparent to this procedure. The used protocol stack is depicted in figure 8.2.2.1-2.\nFigure 8.2.2.1-2: Transparent access to an Intranet\nThe communication between the PLMN and the Intranet may be performed over any network, even an insecure network e.g. the Internet. There is no specific security protocol between the UPF and the Intranet because security is ensured on an end to end basis between the UE and the intranet by the \"Intranet Protocol\".\nUser authentication and encryption of user data are done within the \"Intranet Protocol\" if either of them is needed. This \"Intranet Protocol\" may also carry private (IP) addresses belonging to the address space of the Intranet.\nAn example of an \"Intranet Protocol\" is IPsec (see IETF RFC 1825 [29]). If IPsec is used for this purpose, then IPsec authentication header or security header may be used for user (data) authentication and for the confidentiality of user data (see IETF RFC 1826 [30] and IETF RFC 1827 [31]).

      "content": "When using IPv6 Address Autoconfiguration, the process of setting up the access to an Intranet or ISP involves two signalling phases. The first signalling phase is done in the control plane and consists of the PDU session establishment for 5GS 3GPP or non-3GPP based access, followed by a second signalling phase done in the user plane.\nThe user plane signalling phase shall be stateless. The stateless procedure, which involves only the UE and the SMF or SMF+PGW-C, is described in clause 10.2. 3.\nFor DNNs that are configured for IPv6 address allocation, the SMF or SMF+PGW-C shall only use the Prefix part of the IPv6 address for forwarding of mobile terminated IP packets. The size of the prefix shall be according to the maximum prefix length for a global IPv6 address as specified in the IPv6 Addressing Architecture, see IETF RFC 4291 [32].\nThe SMF or SMF+PGW-C indicates to the UE that Stateless Autoconfiguration shall be performed by sending Router Advertisements as described in clause 10.2.3 and according to the principles defined in IETF RFC 4861 [33] and IETF RFC 4862 [34].\nFor UE supporting IPv6, IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration is mandatory.\nIn this case, the SMF or SMF+PGW-C provides the UE with an IPv6 Prefix belonging to the Intranet/ISP addressing space. A dynamic IPv6 address is given using stateless address autoconfiguration. This IPv6 address is used for packet forwarding within the UPF and for packet forwarding on the Intranet/ISP.\nWhen an SMFor SMF+PGW-C receives an initial access request (i.e. Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext) message, the SMF or SMF+PGW-C deduces from local configuration data associated with the DNN:\n-\tThe source of IPv6 Prefixes (SMF or SMF+PGW-C internal prefix pool, or external address allocation server);\n-\tAny server(s) to be used for address allocation, authentication and/or protocol configuration options retrieval (e.g. IMS related configuration, see 3GPP TS 24.229 [13]);\n-\tThe protocol, i.e. RADIUS, Diameter or DHCPv6, to be used with the server(s);\n-\tThe communication and security feature needed to communicate with the server(s).\nAs an example, the SMF or SMF+PGW-C may use one of the following options:\n-\tSMF or SMF+PGW-C internal Prefix pool for IPv6 prefixes allocation and no authentication;\n-\tSMF or SMF+PGW-C internal Prefix pool for IPv6 prefixes allocation and RADIUS for authentication. The RADIUS DN-AAA server responds with either an Access-Accept or an Access-Reject to the RADIUS client in the SMF or SMF+PGW-C;\n-\tRADIUS for authentication and IPv6 prefix allocation. The RADIUS DN-AAA server responds with either an Access‑Accept or an Access-Reject to the RADIUS client in the SMF or SMF+PGW-C.\n-\tRADIUS for authentication. DHCPv6 for IPv6 prefix allocation and may support IPv6 prefix delegation for allocating additional IPv6 prefix(es). The details of IPv6 prefix delegation are described in clause 10.2.5.\nThe SMF or SMF+PGW-C includes the IPv6 address composed of a Prefix and an Interface-Identifier in the initial access response (Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer). The Interface-Identifier may have any value and it does not need to be unique within or across DNNs. It shall however not conflict with the Interface-Identifier that the SMF or SMF+PGW-C has selected for its own side of the UE-SMF link. The Prefix assigned by the SMF or SMF+PGW-C or the external DN-AAA server shall be globally or site-local unique (see the Note in clause 11.3 of this document regarding the usage of site-local addresses).\nTable 8.2.2.3-1 summarizes the IPv6 prefix allocation and parameter configuration use cases between the UE and the SMF or SMF+PGW-C that may lead the SMF or SMF+PGW-C to interwork with the external RADIUS DN-AAA, Diameter DN-AAA and DHCPv6 servers.

It's up to the external network operator to perform the risk assessment if PAP/CHAP is used for authentication.\nFor IPv6 the PDU session establishment phase is followed by an address autoconfiguration phase. IPv6 prefix is delivered to UE in Router Advertisement message from the SMF or SMF+PGW-C which acts as an access router, in the process of IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration as described in clause 10.2.2.

In this case, the /64 default prefix used for IPv6 stateless autoconfiguration shall be allocated from this network prefix, except for RG may have different shorter IPv6 prefix(es) delegated via DHCPv6 not including the allocated /64 default prefix; the remaining address space from the network prefix may be delegated to the PDU Session using prefix delegation after the PDU Session establishment and IPv6 prefix allocation via IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration as defined in clause 10.2.3.\nDepending on configuration, the SMF may obtain the prefix from a locally provisioned pool, from the PSA UPF or from the external DN.\nIf the UE had indicated that it supports prefix exclusion and the prefix to be delegated to the UE includes the /64 prefix that was allocated to the PDU Session, the SMF or SMF+PGW shall utilize the prefix exclusion feature as specified for DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation in RFC 6603 [62].\nThe UE uses DHCPv6 to request additional IPv6 prefix (i.e.: prefix in addition to the default prefix) from the SMF or SMF+PGW-C after completing stateless IPv6 address autoconfiguration procedures. The UE acts as a \"Requesting Router\" as described in RFC 8415 [49] and inserts one or more IA_PD option(s) into a DHCPv6 Solicit message sent from the UE to the SMF or SMF+PGW-C via the user plane and the UPF or UPF+PGW-U. The SMF or SMF+PGW-C acts as the DHCP server and fulfils the role of a \"Delegating Router\" according to RFC 8415 [49]. The UE optionally includes the RAPID_COMMIT option in the DHCPv6 Solicit message to trigger two-message DHCPv6 procedure instead of the four-message DHCPv6 procedure. The UE shall include OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option code in an OPTION_ORO option to indicate support for prefix exclusion. In response to the DHCPv6 Solicit message, the UE receives a DHCPv6 Reply message with one or more IA_PD prefix(es) for every IA_PD option that it sent in the DHCPv6 Solicit message. The SMF or SMF+PGW-C delegates a prefix excluding the default prefix with help of OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE, except for RG as UE when different shorter IPv6 prefix(es) is delegated via DHCPv6. Prefix exclusion procedures shall follow RFC 6603 [62].\nThe additional requirement for RG connecting to 5GC with IPv6 Prefix Delegation via DHCPv6 is defined in clause 10.2.5.2.",

Upon receipt of the Access-Request message, the DN-AAA server shall respond with an Access-Challenge message. Multi-round authentication using the Access-Challenge (sent by DN-AAA) and Access-Request messages may be used. The DN-AAA server finally authenticates and authorizes the user by replying with an Access Accept message. If the DN-AAA server is also responsible for IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix allocation, the DN-AAA server shall return the allocated IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix in the Access-Accept message.\nFor re-authentication and re-authorization, the SMF shall send a RADIUS Access-Request message with EAP extension and the DN-AAA shall respond with an Access-Challenge message. Multi-round authentication using the Access-Challenge (sent by DN-AAA) and Access-Request messages may be used. The DN-AAA server finally authenticates and authorizes the user by replying with an Access Accept message.\nThe SMF may initiate RADIUS re-authorization procedures for the purpose of IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix allocation (or renew the lease). In this case, the SMF shall set the Service-Type attribute to \"Authorize Only\" and the 3GPP-Allocate-IP-Type subattribute to the type of IP address to be allocated in the Access-Request message sent to the DN-AAA server. If the SMF is using DHCP signalling towards the UE and the DN-AAA server includes the Session-Timeout attribute in the Access-Accept, the SMF may use the Session-Timeout value as the DHCP lease time.

The SMF may wait for the Accounting-Response (START) before sending the final authentication response message in Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation. The SMF may reject the initial access request if the Accounting-Response (START) is not received.

The SMF requests to stop accounting by sending the Accounting-Request (STOP) message to the DN-AAA via the UPF and the DN-AAA responds with the Accounting-Response (STOP) message.\nFigure 11.2.1-1: RADIUS Authentication and Accounting example (successful case)\nWhen PAP/CHAP is used as the authentication protocol with the external DN-AAA server which does not support EAP for the 5GS or for the 5GC, the RADIUS Authentication procedures refer to the non transparent access procedures in clause 11.2.1 and the related RADIUS Authentication description in clause 16.3a.1 in 3GPP TS 29.061 [5] are reused with the following differences:\n-\tthe SMF  performs the actions specified for the P-GW;\n-\tthe external DN-AAA server performs the actions specified for AAA;\n-\tPDU Session Establishment request is sent from the UE to the SMF instead of the Activate PDN connection request being sent from the UE to the S-GW and the Create Session request being sent from S-GW to P-GW;\n-\tPDU Session Establishment accept is sent from the SMF  to the UE instead of the Create Session Response message being sent from the P-GW to S-GW and the Activate PDN Connection Accept being sent from S-GW to the UE; and\n-\tPDU Session Establishment reject is sent from the SMF to the UE instead of the Create Session Response message being sent from the P-GW to the S-GW and the Activate PDN Connection Reject being sent from S-GW to the UE.\n11.2.1a\tAuthentication and Authorization procedures in EPC Interworking\nWhen an SMF+PGW-C receives a Create Session Request message for a given DNN from the MME, the SMF+PGW-C may (depending on the configuration for this DNN) send a RADIUS Access-Request message with EAP extension to a DN-AAA server. Upon receipt of the Access-Request message, the DN-AAA server shall respond with an Access-Challenge message. Multi-round authentication using the Access-Challenge (sent by DN-AAA) and Access-Request messages may be used. The DN-AAA server finally authenticates and authorizes the user by replying with an Access Accept message. If the DN-AAA server is also responsible for IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix allocation, the DN-AAA server shall return the allocated IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix in the Access-Accept message.\nFor re-authentication and re-authorization, the SMF+PGW-C shall send a RADIUS Access-Request message with EAP extension and the DN-AAA shall respond with an Access-Challenge message. Multi-round authentication using the Access-Challenge (sent by DN-AAA) and Access-Request messages may be used. The DN-AAA server finally authenticates and authorizes the user by replying with an Access Accept message.\nThe SMF+PGW-C may initiate RADIUS re-authorization procedures for the purpose of IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix allocation (or renew the lease). In this case, the SMF+PGW-C shall set the Service-Type attribute to \"Authorize Only\" and the 3GPP-Allocate-IP-Type attribute to the type of IP address to be allocated in the Access-Request message sent to the DN-AAA server. If the SMF+PGW-C is using DHCP signalling towards the UE and the DN-AAA server includes the Session-Timeout attribute in the Access-Accept, the SMF+PGW-C may use the Session-Timeout value as the DHCP lease time. The SMF+PGW-C shall not set the DHCP lease time value higher than the Session-Timeout value. The SMF+PGW-C may renew the DHCP lease to the UE without re-authorization towards the DN-AAA server providing that the new lease expiry is no later than the Session-Timeout timer expiry. If the SMF+PGW-C wishes to extend the lease time beyond the current Session-Timeout expiry, it shall initiate a new AAA re-authorization.\nWhen the SMF+PGW-C receives a message indicating a QoS flow or PDN connection release request, the SMF+PGW-C shall send a RADIUS Accounting-Request (STOP) message to the DN-AAA server, which indicates the termination of this particular QoS flow or PDN connection. The SMF+PGW-C shall immediately send the corresponding response to the MME, without waiting for an Accounting-Response (STOP) message from the DN-AAA server.\nThe DN-AAA server shall deallocate the IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix initially allocated to the subscriber, if there is no session for the subscriber.\nAccounting-Request (ON) and Accounting-Request (OFF) messages may be sent from the SMF+PGW-C to the DN-AAA server to ensure the correct synchronization of the session information in the SMF+PGW-C and the DN-AAA server.\nThe SMF+PGW-C may send an Accounting-Request (ON) message to the DN-AAA server to indicate that a restart has occurred. The DN-AAA server may then release the associated resources.\nPrior to a scheduled restart, the SMF+PGW-C may send Accounting-Request (OFF) message to the DN-AAA server. The DN-AAA server may then release the associated resources.\nFigure 11.2.1a-1: RADIUS Authentication and Accounting example (successful case)\nThe above figure 11.2.1a-1 is an example message flow to show the procedure of RADIUS Authentication and Accounting between an SMF+PGW-C and a DN-AAA server:\n1.\tUE initiates the PDN Connection Establishment procedure, including authentication/authorization information.\n2.\tThe MME sends Create Session Request including the authentication/authorization information to the SMF+PGW-C.\nAccording to the configuration in the SMF+PGW-C, step 6 to step 10 are executed before step 3 if the SMF+PGW-C needs to send an EAP-Request message to the UE.\n3.\tIf the N4 session has not been established before, the SMF+PGW-C triggers the N4 Session Establishment procedure to the UPF+PGW-U and sets the N4 rules to block any UE traffic over the PDN Connection (until the Secondary DN authentication and authorization has been completed successfully).\n4.\tThe SMF+PGW-C sends the Access-Request message to the DN-AAA via the UPF+PGW-U in the N4 user plane.\n5-11.\tThe DN-AAA responds with the Access-Challenge message to the SMF+PGW-C via the UPF+PGW-U in the N4 use plane message. The authentication/authorization information is further transferred to UE via Create Session Response and Downlink NAS Transport message, along with uplink data not allowed indication within the PCO attribute. UE responds to the received authentication/authorization data and such information is transferred in Uplink NAS Transport message and Modify Bearer Request, then finally sent to the DN-AAA by the SMF+PGW-C, via the UPF+PGW-U, in the Access-Request message.\n12-17.\tThe DN-AAA responds with the Access-Challenge message to the SMF+PGW-C via the UPF+PGW-U in the N4 use plane message. The authentication/authorization information is further transferred to UE via Update bearer Response and Downlink NAS Transport message.

The SMF+PGW-C proceeds with PDN connection establishment procedure and includes the authentication/authorization information in the Update Bearer Request message with uplink data allowed indication within the PCO attribute, sent to the MME.\n22.\tThe DN-AAA responds with the Accounting-Response (START) message. The SMF+PGW-C may wait for the Accounting-Response (START) before sending the Update Bearer Request in step 21.\n23.\tThe MME sends the Downlink NAS Transport message with Session Management Request with the authentication/authorization information to the UE.\n24.\tThe UE sends a Uplink NAS Transport message with Session Management Response to the MME.\n25.\tThe MME sends Update Bearer Response to the SMF+PGW-C, after which user data is allowed over the PDN connection.\n26-30. At any point, if the UE triggers Detach procedure and send Detech request to the MME then MME sends Delete Session Request message to the SMF+PGW-C, which responds with Delete Session Response message. The SMF+PGW-C requests to stop accounting by sending the Accounting-Request (STOP) message to the DN-AAA via the UPF+PGW-U and the DN-AAA responds with the Accounting-Response (STOP) message.",

      "content": "During the life of a QoS flow some information related to this QoS flow may change. The SMF may send RADIUS Accounting Request Interim-Update to the DN-AAA server upon occurrence of a chargeable event, e.g. RAT change, DNAI change or QoS change. Interim updates are also used when the IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix is allocated/released/re-allocated.\nNOTE:\tDNAI change is only applicable when application relocation possible indicated in the AF traffic influenced PCC rule as described in clause 5.6.7 of TS 23.501 [2], align with the DNAI change in UP path management events as described in clause 4.3.6.3 of TS 23.502 [3]. Only the target DNAI is provided in the ACR message. The change from the UP path status where a DNAI applies to a status where no DNAI applies indicating the de-activation of the AF request for AF influence on traffic routing is not supported in this release.\nWhen the SMF receives a signalling request (i.e. Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext) that indicates the occurrence of one of these chargeable events, the SMF may send an Accounting Request Interim-Update to the DN-AAA server to update the necessary information related to this QoS flow. It is not necessary for the SMF to wait for the RADIUS AccountingResponse message from the DN-AAA server before sending the response for the triggering signalling message (i.e. Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer).

However some IP applications could need to interwork with the SMF to release the corresponding resource (e.g. terminate a particular QoS flow). For this purpose, the DN-AAA server or proxy may send a RADIUS Disconnect-Request to the SMF. On receipt of the Disconnect-Request from the DN-AAA server, the SMF shall release the corresponding resources and reply with a Disconnect-ACK. If the SMF is unable to release the corresponding resources, it shall reply to the DN-AAA server with a Disconnect-NAK. For more information on RADIUS Disconnect, see IETF RFC 5176 [27]. If the SMF deletes the corresponding QoS flow, it is not necessary for the SMF to wait for the response (i.e. Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext) from the AMF before sending the RADIUS Disconnect-ACK to the DN-AAA server. The DN-AAA shall include the identification of the QoS flow to be disconnected within the Disconnect-Request. How to identify the QoS flow to be deleted is implementation specific.\nNOTE:\tThe QoS flow can be identified by the Acct-Session-Id which is extended to include QFI or by the Acct-Session-Id and 3GPP-NSAPI combination if provided by the SMF.\nThe Teardown-Indicator in the RADIUS Disconnect Request message indicates to the SMF that all QoS flows for this particular user and sharing the same user session shall be deleted. The QoS flows that belong to the same PDU session can be are identified by the Acct-Session-Id. The SMF is able to find out all the related QoS flows sharing the same user session once it has found the exact QoS flow from the Acct-Session-Id.

The SMF may also (depending on the configuration for this DNN) send the S-NSSAI and the PDU Session ID that are associated with the PDU Session, respectively in the 3GPP-Session-S-NSSAI AVP and the 3GPP-Session-Id AVP, to a DN-AAA server. Upon receipt of the DER message, the DN-AAA server shall respond with an DEA message. Multi-round authentication using the DEA DEA (with Result-Code set to DIAMETER_MULTI_ROUND_AUTH)  and DER messages may be used. The DN-AAA server finally authenticates and authorizes the user by replying with the DEA message with Result-Code set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS. If the DN-AAA server is also responsible for IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix allocation, the DN-AAA server shall return the allocated IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix in the DEA message.\nFor re-authentication and re-authorization, the SMF shall send a DER message to the DN-AAA server and the DN-AAA server shall respond with a DEA message. Multi-round authentication using the DEA (with Result-Code set to DIAMETER_MULTI_ROUND_AUTH) and DER messages may be used. The DN-AAA server finally authenticates and authorizes the user by replying with the DEA message with Result-Code set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS.\nThe SMF may initiate Diameter re-authorization procedures for the purpose of IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix allocation (or renew the lease). In this case, the SMF shall set the Session-Id to the value used in the initial request, the Auth-Request-Type AVP to \"AUTHORIZE_ONLY\" and the 3GPP-Allocate-IP-Type AVP to the type of IP address to be allocated in the AA-Request message sent to the AAA server. If the SMF is using DHCP signalling towards the UE and the DN-AAA server includes the Session-Timeout attribute in the DEA, the SMF may use the Session-Timeout value as the DHCP lease time. The SMF shall not set the DHCPv4 lease time value higher than the Session-Timeout value. The SMF may renew the DHCP lease to the UE without re-authorization towards the DN-AAA server providing that the new lease expiry is no later than the Session-Timeout timer expiry. If the SMF wishes to extend the lease time beyond the current Session-Timeout expiry, it shall initiate a new AAA re-authorization.\nEven if the SMF was not involved in user authentication, it may send a Diameter Accounting-Request (START) message to a DN-AAA server. If no Diameter session is already open for the same PDU session a Diameter session needs to be activated, otherwise the existing Diameter session is used to send the Accounting-Request (START). If accounting is used per QoS flow, the QFI will identify the particular bearer this accounting message refers to. This message contains parameters, e.g. the tuple which includes the user ID and IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix, to be used by application servers (e.g. WAP gateway) in order to identify the user, the 3GPP-Charging-Id AVP or 3GPP-Charging-Id-v2 AVP according to the length of the Charging Id for the user session. This message may also (depending on the configuration for the DNN) contains the S-NSSAI and the PDU Session ID that are associated with the PDU Session, respectively in the 3GPP-Session-S-NSSAI AVP and the 3GPP-Session-Id AVP, and/or AF traffic influence PCC rule provisioned and then SMF used DNAI in the 3GPP-DNAI AVP, to a DN-AAA server. This message also indicates to the DN-AAA server that the user session has started.\nIf some external applications require Diameter Accounting-Request (START) information before they can process user packets, then the selected DNN (SMF) may be configured in such a way that the SMF drops user data until an Accounting-Answer (START) indicating success is received from the DN-AAA server. The SMF may wait for the Accounting-Answer (START) before sending the final authentication response message in Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation. The SMF may reject the initial access request if the Accounting-Answer (START) is not received. The authentication and accounting servers may be separately configured for each DNN.\nFor IPv4 PDU type, if IPv4 address is allocated via DHCPv4 signalling between the UE and the DN-AAA after PDU session establishment, the SMF may wait to send the Accounting-Request START message until the UE receives its IPv4 address in a DHCPACK.\nWhen the SMF receives a message indicating a QoS flow or PDU session release request and providing a Diameter Accounting-Request START message was sent previously, the SMF shall send a Diameter Accounting-Request (STOP) message to the DN-AAA server, which indicates the termination of this particular QoS flow or PDU session. The SMF shall immediately send the corresponding response (e.g. Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext response) to the AMF, without waiting for an Accounting-Answer (STOP) message from the DN-AAA server.\nIf the last QoS flow of a PDU session is deactivated, the SMF shall additionally send an STR message to the DN-AAA server. The DN-AAA server shall reply with an STA message and shall deallocate the IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix initially allocated to the subscriber.\nThe following figure 12.2.1-1 is an example message flow to show the procedure of Diameter Authentication and Accounting between an SMF and a DN-AAA server:\n1.\tUE initiates the PDU Session Establishment procedure, including authentication/authorization information.\n2.\tThe AMF sends Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request including the authentication/authorization information to the SMF and the SMF responds to the service operation.\nAccording to the configuration in the SMF, step 6 to step 9 are executed before step 3 if the SMF needs to send an EAP-Request message to the UE.\nIn the case of home routed, the AMF sends Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request including the authentication/authorization information to the V-SMF and the V-SMF sends Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Request including the authentication/authorization information to the H-SMF.\n3.\tIf the N4 session has not been established before, the SMF triggers the N4 Session Establishment procedure to the UPF.\nIn the case of home routed, the V-SMF triggers the N4 Session Establishment procedure to the V-UPF and the H-SMF triggers the N4 Session Establishment procedure to the H-UPF.\n4.\tThe SMF sends the DER message to the DN-AAA via the UPF, the message is forwarded from the SMF to the DN-AAA by the UPF in N4 user plane message.\nIn the case of home routed, the H-SMF sends the DER message to the DN-AAA via the H-UPF, the message is forwarded from the H-SMF to the DN-AAA by the H-UPF in N4 user plane message.\n5-10.\tThe DN-AAA responds with the DEA message to the SMF via the UPF, the message is forwarded from the DN-AAA to the SMF by the UPF in N4 user plane message.

The SMF requests to stop accounting by sending the Accounting-Request (STOP) message to the DN-AAA via the UPF and the DN-AAA responds with the Accounting-Response (STOP) message.\nFigure 12.2.1-1: Diameter Authentication and Accounting example (successful case)\nWhen PAP/CHAP is used as the authentication protocol with the external DN-AAA server which does not support EAP for the 5GS, the Diameter Authentication procedures refer to the non transparent access procedures in clause 11.2.1 and related Diameter Authentication descriptions in clause 16a.3a.1 in 3GPP TS 29.061 [5] are reused with the following differences:\n-\tthe SMF performs the actions specified for the P-GW;\n-\tthe external DN-AAA server performs the actions specified for AAA;\n-\tPDU Session Establishment request is sent from the UE to the SMF instead of or the Activate PDN connection request being sent from the UE to the S-GW and the Create Session request being sent from S-GW to P-GW;\n-\tPDU Session Establishment accept is sent from the SMF to the UE instead of the Create Session Response message being sent from the P-GW to S-GW and the Activate PDN Connection Accept being sent from S-GW to the UE; and\n-\tPDU Session Establishment reject is sent from the SMF to the UE instead of the Create Session Response message being sent from the P-GW to the S-GW and the Activate PDN Connection Reject being sent from S-GW to the UE.\n12.2.1a\tAuthentication and Authorization procedures in EPC Interworking\nWhen an SMF+PGW-C receives a Create Session Request message for a given DNN from the MME, the SMF+PGW-C may (depending on the configuration for this DNN) send a Diameter DER message to a DN-AAA server. Upon receipt of the DER message, the DN-AAA server shall respond with an Diameter DEA message. Multi-round authentication using the DEA (with Result-Code set to DIAMETER_MULTI_ROUND_AUTH) and DER messages may be used. The DN-AAA server finally authenticates and authorizes the user by replying with a DEA message with Result-Code set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS. If the DN-AAA server is also responsible for IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix allocation, the DN-AAA server shall return the allocated IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix in the DEA message.\nFor re-authentication and re-authorization, the SMF+PGW-C shall send a Diameter DER message and the DN-AAA shall respond with an DEA message. Multi-round authentication using the DEA (with Result-Code set to DIAMETER_MULTI_ROUND_AUTH) and DER messages may be used. The DN-AAA server finally authenticates and authorizes the user by replying with an DEA message with Result-Code set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS.\nThe SMF+PGW-C may initiate Diameter re-authorization procedures for the purpose of IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix allocation (or renew the lease). In this case, the SMF+PGW-C shall set the Session-Id to the value used in the initial request, the Auth-Request-Type AVP to \"AUTHORIZE_ONLY\" and the 3GPP-Allocate-IP-Type AVP to the type of IP address to be allocated in the AA-Request message sent to the AAA server. If the SMF+PGW-C is using DHCP signalling towards the UE and the DN-AAA server includes the Session-Timeout attribute in the Access-Accept, the SMF+PGW-C may use the Session-Timeout value as the DHCP lease time. The SMF+PGW-C shall not set the DHCP lease time value higher than the Session-Timeout value. The SMF+PGW-C may renew the DHCP lease to the UE without re-authorization towards the DN-AAA server providing that the new lease expiry is no later than the Session-Timeout timer expiry. If the SMF+PGW-C wishes to extend the lease time beyond the current Session-Timeout expiry, it shall initiate a new AAA re-authorization.\nWhen the SMF+PGW-C receives a message indicating a QoS flow or PDN connection release request, the SMF+PGW-C shall send a Diameter Accounting-Request (STOP) message to the DN-AAA server, which indicates the termination of this particular QoS flow or PDN connection. The SMF+PGW-C shall immediately send the corresponding response to the MME, without waiting for an Accounting-Response (STOP) message from the DN-AAA server.\nThe DN-AAA server shall deallocate the IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix initially allocated to the subscriber, if there is no session for the subscriber.\nAccounting-Request (ON) and Accounting-Request (OFF) messages may be sent from the SMF+PGW-C to the DN-AAA server to ensure the correct synchronization of the session information in the SMF+PGW-C and the DN-AAA server.\nThe SMF+PGW-C may send an Accounting-Request (ON) message to the DN-AAA server to indicate that a restart has occurred. The DN-AAA server may then release the associated resources.\nPrior to a scheduled restart, the SMF+PGW-C may send Accounting-Request (OFF) message to the DN-AAA server. The DN-AAA server may then release the associated resources.\nFigure 11.2.1a-1: RADIUS Authentication and Accounting example (successful case)\nThe above figure 11.2.1a-1 is an example message flow to show the procedure of RADIUS Authentication and Accounting between an SMF+PGW-C and a DN-AAA server:\n1.\tUE initiates the PDN Connection Establishment procedure, including authentication/authorization information.\n2.\tThe MME sends Create Session Request including the authentication/authorization information to the SMF+PGW-C.\nAccording to the configuration in the SMF+PGW-C, step 6 to step 10 are executed before step 3 if the SMF+PGW-C needs to send an EAP-Request message to the UE.\n3.\tIf the N4 session has not been established before, the SMF+PGW-C triggers the N4 Session Establishment procedure to the UPF+PGW-U and sets the N4 rules to block any UE traffic over the PDN Connection (until the Secondary DN authentication and authorization has been completed successfully).\n4.\tThe SMF+PGW-C sends the Diameter DER message to the DN-AAA via the UPF+PGW-U in the N4 user plane.\n5-11.\tThe DN-AAA responds with the Diameter DEA message to the SMF+PGW-C via the UPF+PGW-U in the N4 use plane message. The authentication/authorization information is further transferred to UE via Create Session Response and Downlink NAS Transport message, along with uplink data not allowed indication within the PCO attribute. UE responds to the received authentication/authorization data and such information is transferred in Uplink NAS Transport message and Modify Bearer Request, then finally sent to the DN-AAA by the SMF+PGW-C, via the UPF+PGW-U, in the DER message.\n12-17.\tThe DN-AAA responds with the DEA message to the SMF+PGW-C via the UPF+PGW-U in the N4 use plane message. The authentication/authorization information is further transferred to UE via Update bearer Response and Downlink NAS Transport message. UE responds to the received authentication/authorization data and such information is transferred in Uplink NAS Transport message and Update Bearer Response, then finally sent to the DN-AAA by the SMF+PGW-C, via the UPF+PGW-U, in the DER message.\nNOTE:\tStep 12 to step 17 can be repeated depending on the authentication/authorization mechanism used (e.g. EAP-TLS with Result-Code set to DIAMETER_MULTI_ROUND_AUTH in DEA message).\n18.\tThe SMF+PGW-C receives the final result of authentication/authorization from the DN-AAA in the DEA with Result-Code set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS message, via the UPF+PGW-U.\n19.\tThe SMF+PGW-C updates the N4 rules to allow UE traffic over the PDN connection.\n20.\tThe SMF+PGW-C requests to start accounting by sending the Accounting-Request (START) message to the DN-AAA via the UPF+PGW-U.\n21. The SMF+PGW-C proceeds with PDN connection establishment procedure and includes the authentication/authorization information in the Update Bearer Request message with uplink data allowed indication within the PCO attribute, sent to the MME.\n22.\tThe DN-AAA responds with the Accounting-Response (START) message. The SMF+PGW-C may wait for the Accounting-Response (START) before sending the Update Bearer Request in step 21.\n23.\tThe MME sends the Downlink NAS Transport message with Session Management Request with the authentication/authorization information to the UE.\n24.\tThe UE sends a Uplink NAS Transport message with Session Management Response to the MME.\n25.\tThe MME sends Update Bearer Response to the SMF+PGW-C, after which user data is allowed over the PDN connection.\n26-30. At any point, if the UE triggers Detach procedure and send Detech request to the MME then MME sends Delete Session Request message to the SMF+PGW-C, which responds with Delete Session Response message. The SMF+PGW-C requests to stop accounting by sending the Accounting-Request (STOP) message to the DN-AAA via the UPF+PGW-U and the DN-AAA responds with the Accounting-Response (STOP) message.",

      "content": "The Supported-Features AVP is used during session establishment to inform the destination host about the required and optional features that the origin host supports. The client shall, in the first request in a Diameter session indicate the set of supported features. The server shall, in the first answer within the Diameter session indicate the set of features that it has in common with the client and that the server shall support within the same Diameter session. Any further command messages shall always be compliant with the list of supported features indicated in the Supported-Features AVPs during session establishment. Features that are not advertised as supported shall not be used to construct the command messages for that Diameter session. Unless otherwise stated, the use of the Supported-Features AVP on the N6 reference point shall be compliant with the requirements for dynamic discovery of supported features and associated error handling on the Cx reference point as defined in clause 7.2.1 of 3GPP TS 29.229 [41].\nThe base functionality for the N6 reference point is the 3GPP Rel-15 standard and a feature is an extension to that functionality. If the origin host does not support any features beyond the base functionality, the Supported-Features AVP may be absent from the N6 commands. As defined in clause 7.1.1 of 3GPP TS 29.229 [41], when extending the application by adding new AVPs for a feature, the new AVPs shall have the M bit cleared and the AVP shall not be defined mandatory in the command ABNF.\nAs defined in 3GPP TS 29.229 [41], the Supported-Features AVP is of type grouped and contains the Vendor-Id, Feature-List-ID and Feature-List AVPs. On the N6 reference point, the Supported-Features AVP is used to identify features that have been defined by 3GPP and hence, for features defined in this document, the Vendor-Id AVP shall contain the vendor ID of 3GPP (10415). If there are multiple feature lists defined for the N6 reference point, the Feature-List-ID AVP shall differentiate those lists from one another.\nOn receiving an initial request application message, the destination host shall act as defined in clause 7.2.1 of 3GPP TS 29.229 [41].\nOnce the SMF and DN-AAA have negotiated the set of supported features during session establishment, the set of common features shall be used during the lifetime of the Diameter session.\nThe table below defines the features applicable to the N6 interfaces for the feature lists with a Feature-List-ID of 1.\nTable 12.4.1-1: Features of Feature-List-ID 1 used in N6\nFeature bit\nFeature\nM/O\nDescription\n0\neSessionAMBR\nM\nThis feature indicates the support of enhanced Session AMBR function.

      "content": "The SMF shall have a list of preconfigured addresses of signalling servers (the P-CSCF servers). This list shall be provided to the UE at PDU session establishment. It shall be possible to preconfigure the list of preconfigured addresses of signalling servers per DNN.\nThe SMF/UPF may have the locally preconfigured packet filters, and/or the applicable PCC rules, to be applied on the QoS flow. The packet filters shall filter up-link and down-link packets, and shall only allow traffic to/from the signalling servers and to the DNS and the DHCP servers. It shall be possible to locally preconfigure the packet filters per DNN.\nIt shall be possible to enable/disable the use of the services offered via N7 interface per DNN.\nThe SMF shall support IPv4 and/or IPv6 addresses and protocol for IMS signalling and IMS QoS flows.\nThe methods for the UE to discover the P-CSCF address(es) may vary depending on the access technology that the UE is on. The details of the P-CSCF discovery mechanisms for various accesses are specified in 3GPP TS 23.228 [12] and 3GPP TS 24.229 [13]. The P-CSCF discovery mechanisms are:\n-\ta 5GC procedure for the P-CSCF discovery;\n-\tvia DHCP servers i.e. the SMF shall provide the functionality of a DHCP relay agent; and\n-\tif the UE has a P-CSCF FQDN locally configured and request the DNS IP address(es) from the SMF (via 5GC mechanism or DHCP procedures), the SMF shall be able to provide DNS IP address(es) to the UE.\nThe SMF shall have similar functional support depending on the P-CSCF discovery methods supported by the UE on the access technology. For example, for the UE in 3GPP 5G access network the SMF shall have DHCP server function towards the UE while acting as a DHCP client towards external DHCP server, if the SMF is configured to request DNS and/or P-CSCF IP addresses from the external DHCP servers.\nThe SMF shall be able to deliver DNS and/or P-CSCF addresses to the UE if requested by the UE via the 5G network or via DHCP procedures using the relevant DHCP options for IPv4/IPv6 DNS and SIP servers (see IETF RFC 2132 [14], IETF RFC 3361 [15], IETF RFC 3646 [16] and IETF RFC 3319 [17]).\nOn DNNs providing IMS services, the information advertised in Router Advertisements from the SMF to the UEs shall be configured in the same manner as for other DNNs providing IPv6 services except that the \"O‑flag\" shall be set.\nThe \"O-flag\" shall be set in IPv6 Router Advertisement messages sent by the SMF for DNNs used for IMS services. This will trigger a DHCP capable UE to start a DHCPv6 session to retrieve server addresses and other configuration parameters. The UE which doesn't support DHCP shall ignore the \"O-flag\" and shall request the IMS specific configuration (e.g. the P-CSCF address) via other discovery methods supported in the UE (i.e. via locally configured P-CSCF address/FQDN in the UE or via 5G procedure, if applicable).\nThe SMF shall have configurable policy rules for controlling QoS flows used for signalling.",

      "section_title": "Support L2TP for CUPS across N6",
      "content": "L2TP (described in IETF RFC 2661 [57]) is a standard method for tunneling encapsulated Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) frames over an IP network. L2TP operates between two L2TP endpoints (LAC and LNS), and tunnels PPP-encapsulated IP traffic between these endpoints. L2TP runs over UDP/IP and was originally defined for systems where PPP is used by an end-device to connect to a network (e.g. via DSL connections, or 2G/3G PPP PDP context). In these cases, a LAC could be deployed in the network (e.g. in a BNG or GGSN/PGW) to tunnel the PPP traffic to a server (LNS) over an IP network.\nFor 5GC with the UE using IP PDU Session, the PPP functionality that is required to use L2TP is instead supported by the UPF or UPF+PGW-U, as illustrated in below figure. Upon receiving a PDU Session/PDN Connection establishment request from the UE via AMF or MME, SMF or SMF+PGW-C may depend on local L2TP configuration per DNN or the received L2TP information from a DN AAA server in Access-Accept message, request the UPF or UPF+PGW-U to setup L2TP tunnel towards an L2TP network server (LNS) in the external DN and tunnel the PDU Session user plane traffic in this L2TP tunnel. In this case the UPF or UPF+PGW-U acts as a L2TP access concentrator (LAC).\nTo enable this, the SMF or SMF+PGW-C may provide L2TP information to the UPF or UPF+PGW-U as LAC, such as LNS IP address or FQDN, as described in 3GPP TS 29.244 [58]. This L2TP information may be configured on the SMF or SMF+PGW-C as part of the DNN configuration or received from the DN-AAA server. Alternatively, the L2TP tunnel parameters may be configured in the UPF or UPF+PGW-U. The L2TP tunnel parameters include necessary parameters for setting up L2TP tunnel towards the LNS (e.g. LNS address, tunnel password).\nIn addition, the SMF or SMF+PGW-C may provide PAP/CHAP authentication information to the UPF or UPF+PGW-U, for use in L2TP session establishment, in case it was received from the UE in the ePCO IE of the PDU Session Establishment Request.\nWhen L2TP is to be used for a PDU Session, the SMF or SMF+PGW-C may select a UPF or UPF+PGW-U and requests the UE IP address to be allocated by LNS according to 3GPP TS 29.244 [58], the UPF (LAC) may retrieve this IP address from the LNS.\nFigure 18.1-1: L2TP Tunnel between 5GC and external DN\nBelow figure describes the L2TP connection procedures between 5GC and external DN, upon the UE is accessed in 5GC and the SMF or SMF+PGW-C and UPF or UPF+PGW-U has been negotiated supporting L2TP feature.\nFigure 18.1-2: L2TP connection procedures between 5GC and external DN\n0.\tThe SMF or SMF+PGW-C and the UPF or UPF+PGW-U negotiated supporting L2TP feature as specified in 3GPP TS 29.244 [114].\n1.\tThe SMF or SMF+PGW-C receives a PDU Session or PDN Connection establishment request from the UE via AMF or MME and SGW.\nThe UE may include the authentication information for PAP and/or CHAP in ePCO IE. The SMF or SMF+PGW-C may locally configure the UE authentication information for a given DNN.\nThe SMF or SMF+PGW-C may determine that an L2TP session is required for the PDU Session based on local configured L2TP parameters per DNN.\n2.\tThe SMF or SMF+PGW-C may receive the L2TP Tunnel parameters (e.g. LNS IP address or FQDN, tunnel password) from the DN-AAA server in Access-Accept message or Diameter AAA message, or local configured.\nNOTE:\tIf EAP based secondary authentication is used (e.g. DER/DEA), L2TP Proxy Authenticate Extensions for EAP is not supported in this release of the specification.\n3.\tIf L2TP protocol is determined to support the PDU Session, the SMF or SMF+PGW-C selects a UPF or UPF+PGW-U supporting L2TP and be configured with the LAC name/addresses and then requests the UPF or UPF+PGW-U to setup an L2TP tunnel if needed and/or L2TP session towards the L2TP network server (LNS).\nThe SMF or SMF+PGW-C sends PFCP Session Establishment Request to the UPF or UPF+PGW-U, which may include L2TP Tunnel Information for setting up a L2TP tunnel and L2TP session information to setup a L2TP session, together with the information for authentication used during L2TP Tunnel setup, as well as for L2TP session.\nThe L2TP Tunnel Information includes LNS IPv4 address or IPv6 address of LNS, Tunnel Password.\nThe L2TP Session Information includes specific information related to the PDU Session, e.g. a Calling Number which may be set to UE's GPSI, an indication to instruct that the UPF or UPF+PGW-U shall request the LNS to allocate an IP address for the PDU Session, indications to instruct that the UPF or UPF+PGW-U shall request the LNS to provide DNS server addresses or NBNS server addresses etc. as specified in 3GPP TS 29.244 [114].\n4.\tThe UPF or UPF+PGW-U checks if any existing L2TP tunnel can be used to serve the PDU Session according to the information provided in the L2TP Tunnel Information.\nIf the UPF or UPF+PGW-U decides to setup a new L2TP tunnel, it initiates L2TP Tunnel establishment by sending an SCCRQ (Start-Control-Connection-Request) message towards the LNS, the UPF or UPF+PGW-U will allocate a Tunnel ID, and it may include a CHAP Challenge to authenticate the LNS. The Challenge and Challenge Response (to be included in SCCCN) is produced by the UPF or UPF+PGW-U using the Tunnel Password received from the SMF or SMF+PGW-C.\nThe LNS responds with an SCCRP (Start-Control-Connection-Reply) message, containing its allocated Tunnel ID and a CHAP Challenge Response to the Challenge in SCCRQ.\nThe UPF or UPF+PGW-U then responds with a Challenge response for tunnel authentication in the SCCCN (Start-Control-Connection-Connected) message. An L2TP tunnel is established after the tunnel authentication is successful, with the reception of the SCCCN message sent by the LAC to the LNS.\nIf the UPF or UPF+PGW-U decides to use an already existing L2TP tunnel for the requested PDU Session from the UPF or UPF+PGW-C, it proceeds with step 5 below directly without current step.\n5.\tIf the L2TP tunnel is not successfully established, then the UPF or UPF+PGW-U may respond to the SMF or SMF+PGW-C  with PFCP Session Establishment Response with error cause IE value set to either 87 or 89 as specified in clause 8.2.1 of TS 29.244 [114]. The SMF, SMF+PGW-C may decide how to handle the failure associated with the received cause code based on local policy and/or O&M procedures.\n6.\tSMF or SMF+PGW-C may reject the PDU Session/PDN Connection Establishment Request according to step 5.\n7.\tOnce the L2TP Tunnel is established (or already present) between the LAC and the LNS for the PDU Session/PDN Connection requested by the UE, the UPF or UPF+PGW-U proceeds with L2TP session setup towards the LNS.\nThe UPF or UPF+PGW-U sends an ICRQ (Incoming-Call-Request) message towards the LNS, which contains the Tunnel ID assigned by the LNS, its assigned Session ID, and optionally, the Calling Number and Called Number. The LNS responds with an ICRP (Incoming-Call-Reply) message and provides the Session ID assigned by it to the LAC.\nThe LAC then sends an ICCN (Incoming-Call-Connected) message. If proxy LCP and authentication are employed, the ICCN message includes link control parameters (e.g. MRU) and the UE authentication information sent from the SMF or SMF+PGW-C which was received via ePCO IE in step 1. In addition, the UPF or UPF+PGW-U (LAC) will act as a PPP endpoint to use IPCP to request UE IP Address, DNS server address and/or NBNS server address(es).\nThe LCP renegotiation may by triggered by the LNS after receiving the ICCN message. If so, the LAC and LNS will use PPP LCP to communicate link specific control parameter, and indicate authentication type, then either PPP PAP/CHAP takes place. The PPP IPCP transactions takes places to retrieve UE IP Address, DNS server address and/or NBNS server address.\n8.\tThe status of the L2TP session setup is sent by the UPF or UPF+PGW-U to the SMF or SMF+PGW-C  in a PFCP Session Establishment Response.\n9.\tThe SMF or SMF+PGW-C sends a PDU Session Establishment Response to the UE and the user data session is initiated, which may contain the DNS and NBNS Server information.",

      "content": "The SMF in SNPN may support secondary authentication with a Default Credentials Server (DCS) using default UE credentials meant only for secondary authentication upon establishment of an Onboarding PDU Session when the UE has registered successfully with primary authentication without using DCS. In case of secondary authentication with AAA server in DCS the procedures defined in clause 11 and clause 12 shall apply with the AAA server in DCS taking the role of the DN-AAA server. When AAA server in DCS is used for secondary authentication, the SMF selects the AAA server based on its configuration or using the DN-specific identity provided by the UE inside the EAP message in the PDU Session Authentication Complete message as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 [8].\nAnnex A (normative):Rate control related to 5G Cellular Internet of Things (CIoT) optimisations\nA.1\tGeneral\nThe present annex defines specific requirements for rate control related to 5G CIoT optimisations.\nA.2\tSupport of rate control of user data\nA.2.1\tGeneral\nThe rate of user data sent to and from a UE (e.g. a UE using 5G CIoT Optimizations) can be controlled in two different ways:\n-\tServing PLMN rate control\n-\tSmall data rate control\nServing PLMN rate control is further described in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2].\nSmall data rate control allows HPLMN operators on per user to control the amount of user data sent DL and UL.This is done with help of policing user data on a maximum number of user data packets per time unit both DL and UL. Small data DL rate control policing is done in the UPF or the NEF and the small data UL rate control policing is done in the UE. The UPF or NEF can also do small data UL rate control policing.\nFor further information on small data rate control in the UE, see 3GPP TS 24.501 [42].\nNOTE 1:\tExisting Session-AMBR mechanisms are not suitable for such a service since, for radio efficiency and UE battery life reasons, an AMBR of e.g. > 100kbit/s is desirable and such an AMBR translates to a potentially large daily data volume.\nNOTE 2:\tFor serving PLMN rate control and small data rate control, whether the UPF or the NEF is used for data policing depends on the CIoT Optimizations mode that UE and network support (CP or UP Optimizations) and the UE subscription data.\nA.2.2\tSmall Data Rate Control\nThe small data rate control is configured in the (H-)SMF.\nThe small data rate control parameters, if configured, shall consist of:\n-\tthe maximum number of DL user data packets per time unit,\n-\tthe maximum number of UL user data packets per time unit, and\n-\tthe maximum number of additional UL exception reports per time unit.\nPossible time units shall be, minute, hour, day or week.\nIf the small data rate control is supported by the UE as indicated in the Extended Protocol Configuration Options (ePCO) IE included in the PDU session establishment request and if the (H-)SMF is configured to use small data rate control, the (H-)SMF shall include the configured small data UL rate control parameters in the ePCO IE of the PDU session establishment reply, and send the configured small data DL rate control parameters and optionally the UL rate control parameters to the UPF or the NEF. The small data rate control parameters sent to UE, UPF or NEF may include a remaining small data rate control with validity time information that shall be applied first before applying the configured small data rate control parameters.\nNOTE 1:\tThe (H-)SMF can receive small data rate control parameters from the AMF.\nSee 3GPP TS 24.501 [42] for ePCO IE definition.\nIf the small data UL rate control parameters are modified, the (H-)SMF shall initiate a PDU session modification procedure and include the small data UL rate control parameters in the ePCO IE. The (H-)SMF may also send the updated small data UL rate control parameters to the UPF or the NEF.\nIf the small data DL rate control parameters are modified, the (H-)SMF shall send the updated small data DL rate control parameters to the UPF or the NEF.\nThe UPF or the NEF shall enforce the small data DL rate control and may enforce the small data UL rate control per UE.\nNOTE 2:\tThe UE locally enforces this uplink small data rate control instruction. The UE considers this small data rate control instruction as valid until it receives a new one from the (H-)SMF.\nA.2.3\tServing PLMN Rate Control information handling\nThe serving PLMN rate control is configured in the (V-)SMF and it applies per PDU session.\nThis rate control is operator configurable and expressed as \"X NAS Data PDUs per deci hour\" where X is an integer that shall not be less than 10. There are separate limits for uplink and downlink NAS Data PDUs:\nIf serving PLMN rate control information is received from the SMF, the UPF or the NEF shall store this information and use that for DL rate control enforcement for this UE.\nThe UE shall enforce the serving PLMN UL rate control based on the rate control information received from the (V-)SMF.\nThe (V-)SMF may also enforce the serving PLMN UL and/or DL rate control.\nIf the UPF or the NEF previously have received Serving PLMN rate control information, it shall behave as follows:\n-\tIf the UPF or the NEF receives new Serving PLMN rate control information from the SMF, it shall replace the old Serving PLMN rate control information with the new Serving PLMN rate control information and use that for DL rate control enforcement for this UE.\n-\tIf the UPF or the NEF receives no Serving PLMN rate control information from the SMF, it shall still consider the latest received Serving PLMN rate control information from the SMF as valid.\n-\tIf UPF or the NEF receives an indication that Serving PLMN rate control does not apply from the SMF, it shall remove the rate control information based on Serving PLMN rate control information.\nSmall data rate control, if configured, also applies for the same PDU session, see clause A.2.2.\nAnnex B (informative):Change history\nChange
