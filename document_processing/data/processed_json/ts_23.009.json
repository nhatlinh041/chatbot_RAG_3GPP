      "content": "The present document contains a detailed description of the handover procedures to be used in PLMNs. The purpose of the handover procedures, as described in the present document, are to ensure that the connection to the Mobile Station (MS) or User Equipment (UE) is maintained as it moves from one cell or radio network to another. The document defines the circuit switched handover functionality based on the service requirements in 3GPP TS 22.129 [9]. For the circuit switched handover functionality related to SRVCC and vSRVCC, it is based on the service requirements in 3GPP TS 23.216 [26].\nThe present document considers the following five handover cases:\ni)\thandover between Base Station Subsystems (BSS) connected to the same MSC, this is termed an Intra-MSC handover;\nii)\thandover between Radio Network Subsystems (RNS) connected to the same 3G_MSC, this is termed an Intra-3G_MSC handover/relocation. This case also includes inter-system handover between RNS and BSS if the 3G_MSC supports the A-interface. In the context of this specification the term RNS refers also to a BSS when serving a mobile station in Iu mode. Furthermore, this case includes Intra-3G_MSC enhanced SRNS relocation between two RNSs;\niii)\thandover between Base Station Subsystems connected to different MSCs, this is termed an Inter-MSC handover. This category can be sub-divided into three further procedures:\na)\tthe Basic Inter-MSC Handover procedure, where the MS is handed over from a controlling MSC (MSC‑A) to another MSC (MSC‑B);\nb)\tthe Subsequent Inter-MSC Handover procedure, where the MS is handed over from MSC‑B to a third MSC (MSC‑B');\nc)\tthe Subsequent Inter-MSC handback, where the MS is handed back from MSC‑B to MSC‑A.\niv)\thandover between Radio Network Subsystems connected to different 3G_MSCs, this is termed an Inter-3G_MSC handover/relocation. In the context of this specification the term RNS also refers to a BSS when serving a mobile station in Iu mode. This category can be divided into three further sub-procedures:\na)\tthe Inter-3G_MSC Handover procedure from UMTS to GSM, where the UE/MS is handed over from a controlling 3G_MSC (3G_MSC‑A) to an MSC (MSC‑B);\nb)\tthe Inter-3G_MSC Handover procedure from GSM to UMTS, where the UE/MS is handed over from a controlling MSC (MSC‑A) to a 3G_MSC (3G_MSC‑B);\nc)\tthe Inter-3G_MSC Relocation procedure, where the UE is relocated from 3G_MSC‑A to 3G_MSC‑B. This procedure can also be combined with a hard change of radio resources (Hard Handover with switch in the core network).\nThe MSC in items a) and b) this category can optionally be a 3G_MSC supporting the A-interface. The three sub-procedures also cover subsequent handover/relocation to a third MSC‑B' or 3G_MSC‑B' and subsequent handover/relocation back to MSC‑A or 3G_MSC‑A.\nv)\thandover within one BSS connected via AoIP, supported by the same MSC, this is termed \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support\". It is in fact a kind of external handover from MSC perspective and therefore a subset of i) but described in detail in separate clause 6.3 for clarity. The MSC in this category can be any of MSC-A, MSC-B, 3G_MSC-A or 3G_MSC-B.\nIn both cases i) and iii) the same procedures as defined in the 3GPP TS 48.008 [5] and the 3GPP TS 24.008 [10] shall be used on the A‑interface and on the Radio Interface, respectively.\nIn case ii) the same procedures as defined in the 3GPP TS 25.413 [11] and the 3GPP TS 24.008 [10] shall be used on the Iu‑interface. If the 3G_MSC in case ii) also supports the A-interface, the 3GPP TS 48.008 [5] and the 3GPP TS 24.008 [10] shall be used on the A‑interface.\nIn case iii) the handover procedures shall transport the A-interface messages between MSC‑A and MSC‑B described in the Mobile Application Part (MAP), 3GPP TS 29.002 [12].\nIn case iv) the handover procedures shall transport the A-interface messages between 3G_MSC and MSC described in the Mobile Application Part (MAP), 3GPP TS 29.002 [12].\nIn case iv) the relocation procedure shall transport the Iu-interface messages between 3G_MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B described in the Mobile Application Part (MAP), 3GPP TS 29.002 [12].\nThe interworking between the 3GPP TS 29.002 [12] protocol and the 3GPP TS 48.008 [5] protocol is described in the 3GPP TS 29.010 [8].\nMulticall supplementary service is not applicable in GERAN Iu mode and relocation of Multicalls is therefore only possible within UTRAN.\nEnhanced SRNS relocation is possible only within UTRAN between two RNSs conntected to the same 3G_MSC, i.e. in case ii).\nHandovers, which take place on the same MSC are termed Intra-MSC handovers; this includes both Inter-BSS and Intra‑BSS handovers.\nHandovers, which take place on the same 3G_MSC are termed Intra-3G_MSC handovers; this includes Inter-RNS handovers and optionally RNS to BSS and BSS to RNS handovers.\nIn the context of this specification the term InterSystem handover can also refer to a handover which takes place between a Base Station serving a mobile station in Iu mode and a Base Station serving a mobile in A/Gb mode.\n\"Flexible Iu interface for handover/relocation\" Option (see 3GPP TS 23.221 [19], clause 4.2.1): Up to release 99 an RNS can be connected only to one 3G_MSC. From release 4 onwards, as a network option, an RNS can have Iu interfaces to more than one MSC. Such an additional Iu interface may be selected by an MSC during an intra-PLMN relocation or intra-PLMN BSS to RNS handover procedure. This allows the MSC to use an Intra-3G_MSC handover procedure according to case ii) instead of an Inter-3G_MSC handover procedure according to case iv). The decision whether to use the Intra-3G_MSC handover procedure is implementation and configuration dependent. In a network implementing this option, a global title based on the Global RNC-Id may optionally be used for the addressing of the Iu interface messages.\n\"Intra Domain Connection of RAN Nodes to Multiple CN Nodes\" Option (see 3GPP TS 23.236 [18]): when applied, a BSS or an RNS can be connected to more than one MSC.\nThe present document also covers the requirements for handover in ongoing GSM voice group calls, directed retry and handover without a circuit connection between (U)MSCs. The present document does not consider the case of handovers between radio channels on the same BSS (Intra-BSS handover) or the handover of packet radio services except for case v), the \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support\" for Intra-BSS handover in AoIP, involving the MSC as described in clause 6.3. The Inter-RNS handover case that results in a relocation is covered by the present document, but not other Inter-RNS or Intra-RNS handover cases.\nFor voice broadcast calls in GSM, the speaker uses normal point-to-point handover procedures, whilst the listeners use idle mode cell reselection procedures, as for the voice group call listeners.\nVoice group calls is only applicable to GSM and handover of voice group calls is therefore only possible in GSM.\nInter-MSC hand-over imposes a few limitations on the system. After inter-MSC hand-over:\n-\tcall re-establishment is not supported.\nThe list of 3GPP TS 48.008 [5] features supported during and after Inter-MSC handover is given in 3GPP TS 49.008 [7].\nIn the Inter-MSC handover case, the interworking between a Phase 1 BSSMAP protocol possibly used by one MSC and the Phase 2 BSSMAP protocol used in the Phase 2 MAP protocol on the E-interface is performed by this MSC.\nThis specification assumes TDM based Core Network and therefore PCM, ITU-T G.711 [16] encoded, voice channel for speech calls between MSC-A and MSC-B and toward the other party. For bearer independent CS Core Network architecture implementations see 3GPP TS 23.205 [23] and 3GPP TS 23.231 [24]. For handover including Out-Of-Band transcoder control and transcoder free operation see 3GPP TS 23.153 [25]. For handover with Local Call Local Switch (LCLS) see 3GPP TS 23.284 [29].\nNOTE 1:\tThe message primitive names used in the SDL diagrams and message flows in the present document do not represent the actual messages specified in the GSM or 3GPP stage 3 technical specifications. The primitive names are only intended to be indicative of their use in the present document.\nThe MSC server enhanced for SRVCC and the MSC server enhanced for vSRVCC as specified in 3GPP TS 23.216 [26] follows the procedures defined for 3G_MSC-A in the present specification with the exceptions and additions as specified in clause 4.5.",

Throughout this specification the term GSM refers to GERAN A/Gb mode.\nAoIP-Selected codec (Target): the codec selected by the target BSS, to be used by the UE/MS in GERAN A/Gb mode after the handover to the BSS using A interface over IP.\nAoIP-Supported Codecs List (Anchor): a list of codecs for GERAN A/Gb mode derived by the anchor MSC‑A/3G_MSC-A based on the codecs supported by the MS and the codecs available at the anchor MSC‑A/3G_MSC-A for A interface over IP, and provided by MSC-A/3G_MSC-A to MSC-B/3G_MSC-B during Inter-MSC handover/relocation with MAP signalling. Within the list, the codecs are ordered in decreasing order of priority, the first entry in the list being the highest priority codec (preferred codec) and the last entry the lowest priority codec.\nAoIP-Available Codecs list (MAP): a list of codecs for GERAN A/Gb mode available for the target AoIP interface signalled via MAP.\nCSG ID list: for a specific PLMN-ID the list of CSG IDs for which the MS has a valid subscription. The CSG ID list for the registered PLMN can be derived from the CSG subscription data provided by the HLR or the CSS to the anchor MSC. The CSG ID lists for the equivalent PLMNs can be derived from the CSG subscription data provided by the HLR.\nIu mode: mode of operation of the MS when connected to the Core Network via GERAN or UTRAN and the Iu interface. Throughout this specification the term UMTS refers to UTRAN or GERAN Iu mode.\nIur interface: the logical interface between two UTRAN RNSs.\nIur-g interface: the logical interface between two BSSs or a BSC and an RNC and it is only considered in Iu mode.\nIu Currently used codec: the codec used by the UE/MS in UTRAN or GERAN Iu mode before a handover or SRNS relocation.\nIu Selected codec: the codec to be used by the UE/MS in UTRAN or GERAN Iu mode after the handover or SRNS relocation.\nIu Supported Codecs List: a list of codecs supported by the MS and by the core network, provided by MSC-A/3G_MSC-A to 3G_MSC-B during Inter-MSC handover/relocation. The Iu Supported Codecs List may contain separate list of codecs for UTRAN Iu mode and GERAN Iu mode. Within each list, the codecs are ordered in decreasing order of priority, the first entry in the list being the highest priority codec (preferred codec) and the last entry the lowest priority codec.\nDefault speech codec: In UTRAN Iu mode the default speech codec is the UMTS AMR or UMTS AMR2 codec, dependent on the capabilities of the UE/MS. For a description of how the network determines the default UMTS speech codec, see 3GPP TS 24.008 [10], clause 5.2.1.11. If necessary, 3G_MSC-B shall use the Radio Resource Information instead of the GSM Bearer Capability, since the GSM Bearer Capability is not available in MSC-B.\nIn GERAN Iu mode the default speech codec is the AMR FR codec.\nSRVCC MSC: MSC server enhanced for SRVCC as defined in 3GPP TS 23.216 [26] clause 5.3.2.\nvSRVCC MSC: MSC server enhanced for vSRVCC as defined in 3GPP TS 23.216 [26] clause 5.3.2a.\nUE Specific Behaviour Information - Iu (UESBI-Iu): information that is sent from the MSC to the RAN and that can be used to derive specific information about the UE's capabilities.\nFor the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions given in 3GPP TS 23.216 [26] apply:\nSRVCC\nvSRVCC\nFor the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions given in 3GPP TS 23.237 [31] apply:\nSCC AS\nFor the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions given in 3GPP TS 24.008 [10] apply:\nCSG cell\nCSG ID",

When BSSAP procedures have to be performed, they are initiated and driven by MSC‑A.\nIf AoIP is supported by MSC-A and BSS, then the BSS or the MSC-A may initiate a \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support\" as described in detail in clause 6.3.\nIn the Inter-MSC handover case, MSC‑A is the MSC which controls the call and the mobility management of the Mobile during the call, before, during and after a basic or subsequent handover. When BSSAP procedures related to dedicated resources have to be performed towards the MS, they are initiated and driven by MSC‑A. The MSC‑A - MSC‑B interface works as a MSC - BSS interface for a subset of BSSMAP procedures. These BSSMAP procedures, described in 3GPP TS 49.008 [7] are only those related to dedicated resources. The DTAP signalling is relayed transparently by MSC‑B between MSC‑A and the MS.\nDuring a basic handover, MSC‑A initiates and controls all the handover procedure, from its initiation (reception of Handover Required from BSS-A on A-interface) until its completion (reception of Handover Complete from MSC‑B on E-interface).\nFor handover to an area where \"Intra Domain Connection of RAN Nodes to Multiple CN Nodes\" is applied, MSC-A can have multiple target CN nodes for each handover target in a pool-area as specified in 3GPP TS 23.236 [18].\nDuring a subsequent handover back to MSC‑A, MSC‑A acts as a BSS towards MSC‑B, which controls the handover procedure until the termination in MSC‑A of the handover radio resources allocation (sending of the Handover Request Acknowledge to MSC‑B from MSC‑A). Then all handover related messages shall terminate at MSC‑A (e.g. Handover Detect/Complete from BSS-B, Handover Failure from BSS-A).\nDuring a subsequent handover to a third MSC, MSC‑A works towards MSC‑B' as described above in the basic handover paragraph and towards MSC‑B as described above in subsequent handover paragraph.\nIn the Inter-System, inter-MSC handover case, MSC‑A is the MSC which controls the call and the mobility management of the Mobile during the call, before, during and after a basic or subsequent handover. When BSSAP procedures related to dedicated resources have to be performed towards the MS, they are initiated and driven by MSC‑A. The MSC‑A - 3G_MSC‑B interface works as a MSC - BSS interface for a subset of BSSMAP procedures. These BSSMAP procedures, described in 3GPP TS 49.008 [7] are only those related to dedicated resources. The DTAP signalling is relayed transparently by 3G_MSC‑B between MSC‑A and the MS.\nDuring a basic inter-system handover, MSC‑A initiates and controls all the handover procedure, from its initiation (reception of Handover Required from BSS-A on A-interface) until its completion (reception of Handover Complete from 3G_MSC‑B on E-interface).\nDuring a subsequent inter-system handover back to MSC‑A, MSC‑A acts as a BSS towards 3G_MSC‑B, which controls the handover procedure until the termination in MSC‑A of the handover radio resources allocation (sending of the Handover Request Acknowledge to 3G_MSC‑B from MSC‑A).

If MSC-A supports handover to a CSG cell, the serving BSS is served by MSC-A and provides a CSG ID for the target cell, and the call is not an emergency call, then MSC-A checks the CSG membership of the UE for the target cell using the CSG subscription data provided by the HLR or the CSS before proceeding with the handover procedure. If there is no subscription data for this CSG ID or the CSG subscription for the CSG ID has expired, the MSC-A considers the membership check as failed.

If the CSG cell is not configured as possible handover target, MSC-A will not proceed with the handover.\nFor handover of an emergency call to a CSG cell, MSC-A shall skip the CSG membership check and proceed with the handover procedure.\nFor inter-PLMN handover to a CSG cell, if the HLR or the CSS provided a CSG ID list for the target PLMN, MSC-A shall validate the CSG membership of the UE in the target CSG cell using the CSG ID list for the target PLMN.\nNOTE 2:\tDue to certain restrictions in the access stratum, inter-PLMN handover to a CSG cell in a PLMN which is not an equivalent PLMN for the UE is not supported; therefore, the target PLMN will always be an equivalent PLMN.\nIf the HLR did not provide any CSG ID lists for the equivalent PLMNs, then based on operator's configuration the MSC-A may allow the handover by validating the CSG membership of the UE in the target CSG cell using the CSG ID list of the registered PLMN-ID. Otherwise, MSC-A shall reject the handover due to no CSG subscription information of the target PLMN-ID available.\nNOTE 3:\tIf MSC-A uses the CSG ID list of the registered PLMN-ID for membership validation, as the UE is using the CSG ID list of the equivalent PLMN, inter-PLMN handover to a CSG cell of an equivalent PLMN can only occur if the CSG ID of the cell is both in the CSG ID list of the registered PLMN used by MSC-A and in the CSG ID list of the equivalent PLMN used by the UE. If the HLR provided CSG ID lists for the equivalent PLMNs, this restriction does not apply.\nFor subsequent inter-MSC handover to a third 3G_MSC-B', if MSC-B/3G_MSC-B belongs to a different PLMN than MSC-A, then as an operator option MSC-A may perform an additional CSG membership check for the target cell.",

This unit is used to control the signalling between the MSC, BSC and MS. Interface A' is the connection to the old BSC and interface A'' is the connection to the new BSC, when an Intra-MSC handover takes place. Interface x represents the interworking connection to the Handover Control Procedures MSC‑A.\n2)\tCall Control Procedures MSC‑A. This unit is used to control the call. Interface B' is used for normal call control procedures. When a Basic handover from MSC‑A to MSC‑B is to be performed then interface B'' is employed to provide a signalling and call control connection to MSC‑B. If a Subsequent handover to MSC‑B' is to be performed then interface B''' is used. Similarly, when a Basic inter-system handover from MSC‑A to 3G_MSC‑B is to be performed, then interface B'' is employed to provide a signalling and call control connection to 3G_MSC‑B. If a subsequent inter-system handover to 3G_MSC‑B' is to be performed, then interface B''' is used.\n3)\tHandover Control Procedures MSC‑A. This unit provides both the overall control of the handover procedure and interworking between the internal interfaces (x, y and z).\n4)\tMAP Procedures MSC‑A. This unit is responsible for controlling the exchange of MAP messages between MSCs during an Inter-MSC handover, or between MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B during an Inter-system Inter-MSC handover. This unit communicates with the Handover Control Procedures MSC‑A via interface z.\nSwitching functions:\n5)\tSwitch and Handover Device MSC‑A. For all calls, except for ongoing voice group calls (see 3GPP TS 43.068 [3] for a definition) this unit is responsible for connecting the new path into the network via interface B'. In the case of ongoing voice group calls this unit is responsible for maintaining the connection between the down link group call channels and the active uplink. In specific cases it may be unnecessary to take any explicit action in the MSC concerning the handover device. The handover device interconnections are illustrated in figure 2.\nFigure 1: Functional composition of the controlling MSC (MSC-A) for supporting handover\nFor MS to MS calls in the same MSC the configuration in figure 2b applies. In this case interface B'' is internal to MSC‑A and does not connect to another MSC.\nThe handover device can either be a three-party bridge or a switching facility without three-party connection capabilities. For a three-party bridge configuration the states of the handover device are as shown in table 1. The three‑party configuration exists in the intermediate state. This type of handover device may reduce the interruption time. However, this may require noise reduction if one of the radio channels is unterminated at some time in the intermediate state.\nFor a handover device consisting of a simple switch there will be no intermediate state.\nTable 1: States of the handover device\nResulting\nCase\nInitial\nIntermediate\nConnection\nConnection\nConnection\nSuccessful\nUnsuccessful\nProcedure\nProcedure\nFigure 2a)\nB' to A'\nB' to A' and A''\nB' to A''\nB' to A'\nFigure 2b)\nB' to A'\nB' to A' and B''\nB' to B''\nB' to A'\nFigure 2c)\nB' to B''\nB' to B''and B'''\nB' to B'''\nB' to B''\nNOTE:\tIn a) and b) A' is released after handover;\nIn c) B'' is released after handover.\nFigure 2: Connections in the handover device (Unit 5)",

This means that MSC‑B keeps control of the radio resources connection and release towards BSS-B. MSC‑B will do some processing on the BSSMAP information received on the E-interface or A-interface whereas it will relay the DTAP information transparently between A‑interface and E-interface. MSC‑A initiates and drives a subset of BSSMAP procedures towards MSC‑B, while MSC‑B controls them towards its BSSs to the extent that MSC‑B is responsible for the connections of its BSSs. The release of the dedicated resources between MSC‑B and BSS-B is under the responsibility of MSC‑B and BSS‑B, and is not directly controlled by MSC‑A. When clearing is to be performed due to information received from BSS-B, MSC‑B shall transfer this clearing indication to MSC‑A, to clear its connection with BSS-B, to terminate the dialogue with MSC‑A through the E‑interface, and to release its circuit connection with MSC‑A, if any. In the same way, the release of the connection to its BSS-B, is initiated by MSC‑B, when the dialogue with MSC‑A ends normally and a release is received from the circuit connection with MSC‑A, if any, or when the dialogue with the MSC‑A ends abnormally.\nWhen a release is received by MSC‑B for the circuit connection with MSC‑A then MSC‑B shall release the circuit connection.\nIn the Inter-system Inter-MSC handover case, the role of MSC‑B (MSC‑B') is only to provide radio resources control within its area.

If MSC-B supports handover to a CSG cell, the serving BSS is served by MSC-B and provides a CSG ID for the target cell, and the call is not an emergency call, then MSC-B checks the CSG membership of the UE for the target cell using the CSG subscription data provided by the anchor MSC-A or 3G_MSC-A during the basic inter-MSC handover before proceeding with the subsequent handover procedure.

      "content": "In the Intra-3G_MSC-A handover/relocation case, 3G_MSC‑A controls the call, the mobility management and the radio resources before, during and after an Intra-3G_MSC-A handover/relocation. When RANAP or BSSMAP procedures have to be performed, they are initiated and driven by 3G_MSC‑A.\nIn a network implementing the \"Flexible Iu interface for handover/relocation\" option, 3G_MSC-A may optionally use a global title based on the Global RNC-Id for the addressing of the Iu interface messages towards the target RNC.\nFor handover/relocation to an area where \"Intra Domain Connection of RAN Nodes to Multiple CN Nodes\" is applied, 3G_MSC-A can have multiple target CN nodes for each handover/relocation target in a pool-area as specified in 3GPP TS 23.236 [18].\nIn the case of intra-3G_MSC-A handover of a speech call, 3G_MSC‑A controls the transcoder in the core network. The 3G_MSC‑A determines, if a transcoder is required to be inserted or released in the CN.\nIf AoIP is supported by 3G_MSC-A and BSS, then the BSS or the 3G_MSC-A may initiate a \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support\" as described in detail in clause 6.3.\nIn the case of Inter-3G_MSC relocation, 3G_MSC-A links out the transcoder.\nIn the Inter-3G_MSC relocation case, 3G_MSC‑A is the 3G_MSC that controls the call and the mobility management of the UE during the call, before, during and after a basic or subsequent relocation. When RANAP procedures related to dedicated resources have to be performed towards the UE, they are initiated and driven by 3G_MSC‑A. The 3G_MSC‑A - 3G_MSC‑B interface works as a 3G_MSC - RNS interface for the RANAP procedures. The Direct Transfer signalling is relayed transparently by 3G_MSC‑B between 3G_MSC‑A and the UE.\nDuring a successful relocation the order to perform location reporting at change of Service Area is not transferred to the target RNS. In the Intra-3G_MSC-A relocation case, the 3G_MSC-A re-issues the Location Reporting Control towards the target RNS. In the Inter-3G_MSC relocation case, 3G_MSC-A keeps the control of the Location Report Control procedure. However, re-issuing the Iu-LOCATION-REPORTING-CONTROL messages due to subsequent Intra-3G_MSC-B relocations is the responsibility of 3G_MSC-B.\nDuring a basic relocation, 3G_MSC‑A initiates and controls all the relocation procedure, from its initiation (reception of Relocation Required from RNS-A on Iu-interface) until its completion (reception of Relocation Complete from 3G_MSC‑B on E-interface).\nDuring a subsequent relocation back to 3G_MSC‑A, 3G_MSC‑A acts as an RNS towards 3G_MSC‑B, which controls the relocation procedure until the termination in 3G_MSC‑A of the handover radio resources allocation (sending of the Relocation Request Acknowledge to 3G_MSC‑B from 3G_MSC‑A). Then all relocation related messages shall terminate at 3G_MSC‑A (e.g. Relocation Detect/Complete from RNS-B, Relocation Cancel from RNS-A).\nDuring a subsequent relocation to a third 3G_MSC-B', 3G_MSC‑A works towards 3G_MSC‑B' as described above in the basic relocation paragraph and towards 3G_MSC‑B as described above in subsequent relocation paragraph.\nIn the Inter-System, inter-3G_MSC handover case, 3G_MSC‑A is the 3G_MSC which controls the call and the mobility management of the UE/MS during the call, before, during and after a basic or subsequent inter-system handover. When BSSAP procedures related to dedicated resources have to be performed towards the UE/MS, they are initiated and driven by 3G_MSC‑A. The 3G_MSC‑A – MSC‑B interface works as a 3G_MSC – BSS interface for a subset of BSSMAP procedures. These BSSMAP procedures described in 3GPP TS 49.008 [7] are those related to dedicated resources. The DTAP signalling is relayed transparently by MSC‑B between 3G_MSC‑A and the UE/MS.\nDuring a basic inter-system UMTS to GSM handover, 3G_MSC‑A initiates and controls all the handover procedure, from its initiation (reception of Relocation Required from RNS-A on Iu-interface) until its completion (reception of Handover Complete from MSC‑B on E-interface).\nDuring a subsequent inter-system UMTS to GSM handover back to 3G_MSC‑A, 3G_MSC‑A acts as a BSS towards 3G_MSC‑B, which controls the handover procedure until the termination in 3G_MSC‑A of the handover radio resources allocation (sending of the Handover Request Acknowledge to 3G_MSC‑B from 3G_MSC‑A). Then all handover related messages shall terminate at 3G_MSC‑A (e.g. Handover Detect/Complete from BSS-B, Relocation  Cancel from RNS-A).\nDuring a subsequent inter-system UMTS to GSM handover to a third 3G_MSC, 3G_MSC‑A works towards MSC‑B' as described above in the basic inter-system handover paragraph and towards 3G_MSC‑B as described above in subsequent inter-system handover paragraph.\nDuring a basic inter-system GSM to UMTS handover, 3G_MSC‑A initiates and controls all the handover procedure, from its initiation (reception of Handover Required from BSS-A on A-interface) until its completion (reception of Handover Complete from 3G_MSC‑B on E-interface).\nDuring a subsequent inter-system GSM to UMTS handover back to 3G_MSC‑A, 3G_MSC‑A acts as an RNS towards MSC‑B, which controls the handover procedure until the termination in 3G_MSC‑A of the handover radio resources allocation (sending of the Handover Request Acknowledge to MSC‑B from 3G_MSC‑A). Then all handover related messages shall terminate at 3G_MSC‑A (e.g. Relocation Detect/Complete from RNS-B, Handover Failure from BSS‑A).\nDuring a subsequent inter-system GSM to UMTS handover to a third 3G_MSC, 3G_MSC‑A works towards 3G_MSC‑B' as described above in the basic inter-system handover paragraph and towards MSC‑B as described above in subsequent inter-system handover paragraph.\n3G_MSC-A may assign a priority level defined as RAB parameter in 3GPP TS 25.413 [11] for each bearer. In case of relocation of a multicall configuration the 3G_MSC-B or the target RNC shall select the bearers to be handed over according to the priority level, if the target cell is not able to accommodate all bearers. If a selection has to be made between bearers of the same priority level, then the selection criteria are implementation dependent.\nFor network sharing (see 3GPP TS 25.401 [20], clause 7.2.3) 3G MSC-A shall send the SNA information to 3G_MSC-B except for emergency calls.\nIf 3G_MSC-A supports the optional supplementary service Multicall (See 3GPP TS 23.135 [17]) and UE is engaged with multiple bearers the following description applies:\n-\tIn the Intra-3G_MSC relocation case, the 3G-MSC-A tries to relocate all bearers to a new RNS.\n-\tIn the basic relocation case, the 3G-MSC-A tries to relocate all bearers to 3G_MSC-B. If 3G_MSC-A receives an indication that the 3G_MSC-B does not support multiple bearers, then 3G_MSC-A shall be able to select one bearer to be handed over according to 3GPP TS 22.129 [9] and tries again to relocate the selected bearer.\n-\tIn the subsequent relocation to a third 3G_MSC-B' case, the 3G-MSC-A tries to relocate all bearers to 3G_MSC-B'. If 3G_MSC-A receives an indication that the 3G_MSC-B' does not support multiple bearers, then 3G_MSC-A shall be able to select one bearer to be handed over according to 3GPP TS 22.129 [9] and tries again to relocate the selected bearer.\n-\tIn the Intra-3G_MSC inter-system UMTS to GSM handover case and the basic inter-system UMTS to GSM handover case, the 3G_MSC-A shall be able to select one bearer to be handed over according to 3GPP TS 22.129 [9] and tries to handover the selected bearer.\n-\tIn all cases described above, 3G_MSC-A shall release some calls which has been carried by the bearers failed to set up in new RNS or the bearers not to be handed over.\nIf 3G_MSC-A supports the \"Provision of UE Specific Behaviour Information to Network Entities\" (see 3GPP TS 23.195 [21]), it shall send UESBI-Iu to the RNS-B during intra-3G_MSC handover/relocation and during subsequent inter-3G_MSC handover/relocation back to 3G_MSC-A. Furthermore, 3G_MSC-A shall send UESBI-Iu to the target MSC during basic and subsequent inter-MSC handover, and basic and subsequent inter-3G_MSC handover/relocation.\nFor a SCUDIF call (see 3GPP TS 23.172 [22]) 3G_MSC-A may send information of the alternative radio access bearer to the target RNS during the intra-3G_MSC handover/relocation and to the target MSC during basic and subsequent inter-3G_MSC handover/relocation or assignment.\n3G_MSC-A may support inter-system handover or SRNS relocation to a CSG cell. If 3G_MSC-A supports handover/relocation to a CSG cell, the serving BSS or RNS is served by 3G_MSC-A and provides a CSG ID for the target cell, and the call is not an emergency call, then 3G_MSC-A checks the CSG membership of the UE for the target cell using the CSG subscription data provided by the HLR or the CSS before proceeding with the handover/relocation procedure. If there is no subscription data for this CSG ID or the CSG subscription for the CSG ID has expired, the 3G_MSC-A considers the membership check as failed. If for a specific PLMN-ID the same CSG ID exists in both CSS subscription data and HLR subscription data, the CSG subscription data from the HLR shall take precedence over the data from CSS.\nNOTE 1:\tIf 3G_MSC-A does not support CSG membership checking, and a CSG cell is configured as possible handover target, 3G_MSC-A will proceed with the handover/relocation to the CSG cell; if the CSG cell is not configured as possible handover target, 3G_MSC-A will not proceed with the handover/relocation.\nFor handover of an emergency call to a CSG cell, 3G_MSC-A shall skip the CSG membership check and proceed with the handover/relocation procedure.\nFor inter-PLMN handover/relocation to a CSG cell, if the HLR or the CSS provided a CSG ID list for the target PLMN, 3G_MSC-A shall validate the CSG membership of the UE in the target CSG cell using the CSG ID list for the target PLMN.\nNOTE 2:\tDue to certain restrictions in the access stratum, inter-PLMN handover to a CSG cell in a PLMN which is not an equivalent PLMN for the UE is not supported; therefore, the target PLMN will always be an equivalent PLMN.\nIf the HLR did not provide any CSG ID lists for the equivalent PLMNs, then based on operator's configuration the 3G_MSC-A may allow the handover/relocation by validating the CSG membership of the UE in the target CSG cell using the CSG ID list of the registered PLMN-ID. Otherwise, 3G_MSC-A shall reject the handover/relocation due to no CSG subscription information of the target PLMN-ID available.\nNOTE 3:\tIf 3G_MSC-A uses the CSG ID list of the registered PLMN-ID for membership validation, as the UE is using the CSG ID list of the equivalent PLMN, inter-PLMN handover to a CSG cell of an equivalent PLMN can only occur if the CSG ID of the cell is both in the CSG ID list of the registered PLMN used by 3G_MSC-A and in the CSG ID list of the equivalent PLMN used by the UE. If the HLR provided CSG ID lists for the equivalent PLMNs, this restriction does not apply.\nFor subsequent inter-MSC handover/relocation back to 3G_MSC-A or to a third 3G_MSC-B', if MSC-B/3G_MSC-B belongs to a different PLMN than 3G_MSC-A, then as an operator option MSC-A may perform an additional CSG membership check for the target cell.",

Interface x represents the interworking connection to the Handover/Relocation Control Procedures 3G_MSC‑A.\n2)\tCall Control Procedures 3G_MSC‑A. This unit is used to control the call. Interface B' is used for normal call control procedures. When a Basic relocation from 3G_MSC‑A to 3G_MSC‑B is to be performed then interface B'' is employed to provide a signalling and call control connection to 3G_MSC‑B. If a Subsequent handover/relocation to 3G_MSC‑B' is to be performed then interface B''' is used. Similarly, when a Basic inter-system handover from 3G_MSC‑A to 3G_MSC‑B is to be performed, then interface B'' is employed to provide a signalling and call control connection to 3G_MSC‑B. If a Subsequent inter-system handover to 3G_MSC‑B' is to be performed then interface B''' is used.\n3)\tHandover/Relocation Control Procedures 3G_MSC‑A. This unit provides both the overall control of the handover/relocation procedure and interworking between the internal interfaces (x, y and z).\n4)\tMAP Procedures 3G_MSC‑A. This unit is responsible for controlling the exchange of MAP messages between 3G_MSCs during an Inter-3G_MSC handover/relocation, or between 3G_MSC‑A and MSC‑B during an Inter-system Inter-3G_MSC handover. This unit communicates with the Handover/Relocation Control Procedures 3G_MSC‑A via interface z.\nSwitching functions:\n5)\tSwitch and Handover/Relocation Device 3G_MSC‑A. For all calls this unit is responsible for connecting the new path into the network via interface B'. In specific cases it may be unnecessary to take any explicit action in the 3G_MSC concerning the handover/relocation device. The handover/relocation device interconnections are illustrated in figure 5.\nFigure 4: Functional composition of the controlling 3G_MSC (3G_MSC‑A)for supporting handover/relocation\nFor UE/MS to UE/MS calls in the same 3G_MSC the configuration in figure 5b applies. In this case interface B'' is internal to 3G_MSC‑A and does not connect to another 3G_MSC.\nThe handover/relocation device can be either a three-party bridge or a switching facility without three-party connection capabilities. For a three-party bridge configuration the states of the handover/relocation device are as shown in table 2. The three-party configuration exists in the intermediate state. This type of handover/relocation device may reduce the interruption time. However, this may require noise reduction if one of the radio channels is unterminated at some time in the intermediate state.\nFor a handover/relocation device consisting of a simple switch there will be no intermediate state.\nTable 2: States of the handover/relocation device\nResulting\nCase\nInitial\nIntermediate\nConnection\nConnection\nConnection\nSuccessful\nUnsuccessful\nProcedure\nProcedure\nFigure 5a)\nB' to Iu'\nB' to Iu'\nB' to A'\nB' to Iu' and Iu''\nB' to Iu' and A''\nB' to A'  and Iu''\nB' to Iu''\nB' to A''\nB' to Iu''\nB' to Iu'\nB' to Iu'\nB' to A'\nFigure 5b)\nB' to Iu'\nB' to Iu' and B''\nB' to B''\nB' to Iu'\nFigure 5c)\nB' to B''\nB' to B''and B'''\nB' to B'''\nB' to B''\nNOTE:\tIn a) and b) Iu' is released after handover/relocation;\nIn c) B'' is released after handover/relocation.\nFigure 5: Connections in the handover/relocation device (Unit 5)",

      "content": "In the Intra-3G_MSC-B handover/relocation case, the 3G_MSC‑B keeps the control of the whole Intra-3G_MSC-B handover/relocation procedure. 3G_MSC-B notifies MSC-A or 3G_MSC-A of intra-3G_MSC-B InterSystem handover and intra GSM handovers (including \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support\"), by using the A-HANDOVER-PERFORMED message.\n-\tIf the security algorithms have been changed during an intra-3G_MSC-B SRNS relocation; or\n-\tif the codec type or codec modes of the Iu Selected codec have been changed during this relocation and the Iu Supported Codecs List was received by 3G_MSC-B before,\nthen 3G_MSC-B shall indicate the changed parameters, i.e. the selected UMTS algorithm(s) and/or the codec type and codec modes of the Iu Selected codec, to MSC-A or 3G_MSC-A in the MAP-PROCESS-ACCESS-SIGNALLING request.\nEncapsulated in the MAP-PROCESS-ACCESS-SIGNALLING request 3G_MSC-B shall send:\n-\tan A-HANDOVER-PERFORMED message, when encapsulated BSSAP is used on the E interface; or\n-\tan Iu-LOCATION-REPORT message, when encapsulated RANAP is used on the E interface.\nOn reception of an order to perform location reporting at change of Service Area from 3G_MSC-A, 3G_MSC-B shall be responsible to re-issue the Iu-LOCATION-REPORTING-CONTROL message after subsequent Intra-3G_MSC-B relocations/handovers. This shall be performed immediately after the successful completion of the Relocation Resource Allocation procedure.\nIn a network implementing the \"Flexible Iu interface for handover/relocation\" option, in the Intra-3G_MSC handover/relocation case, 3G_MSC-B may optionally use a global title based on the Global RNC-Id for the addressing of the Iu interface messages towards the target RNC.\nIf AoIP is supported by 3G_MSC-B and BSS, then the BSS or the 3G_MSC-B may initiate a \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support\" as described in detail in clause 6.3.\nIf AoIP is supported and no transcoder is inserted in the BSS, then 3G_MSC‑B shall provide transcoder resources.\nFor subsequent inter-MSC handover/relocation to an area where \"Intra Domain Connection of RAN Nodes to Multiple CN Nodes\" is applied, 3G_MSC-B can have multiple target CN nodes for each handover target in a pool-area as specified in 3GPP TS 23.236 [18].\nThe role of 3G_MSC‑B is also to provide transcoder resources. For speech calls in UMTS, 3G_MSC-B shall select an Iu Selected codec from the Iu Supported Codecs List provided by MSC-A/3G_MSC-A in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request. If the Iu Supported Codecs List was not received or 3G_MSC-B does not support the selection of codec based on the Iu-Supported Codecs List, 3G_MSC-B shall select the appropriate default speech codec.\nIf an intra-3G_MSC-B intersystem handover to UMTS is performed, the Iu Supported Codecs List was received by 3G_MSC-B during the basic inter MSC handover/relocation procedure and 3G_MSC-B supports the selection of codec based on the Iu-Supported Codecs List, then 3G_MSC-B shall indicate the Iu Selected codec to MSC-A or 3G_MSC-A in MAP-PROCESS-ACCESS-SIGNALLING request.\nIn the Inter-3G_MSC relocation case, the role of 3G_MSC‑B (3G_MSC‑B') is only to provide radio resources control within its area. This means that 3G_MSC‑B keeps control of the radio resources connection and release towards RNS-B. 3G_MSC‑B will do some processing on the RANAP information received on the E-interface or the RANAP information received on the Iu-interface whereas it will relay the Direct Transfer information transparently between Iu‑interface and E-interface. 3G_MSC‑A initiates and drives RANAP procedures towards 3G_MSC‑B, while 3G_MSC‑B controls them towards its RNSs to the extent that 3G_MSC‑B is responsible for the connections of its RNSs. The release of the dedicated resources between 3G_MSC‑B and RNS-B is under the responsibility of 3G_MSC‑B and RNS‑B, and is not directly controlled by 3G_MSC‑A. When clearing is to be performed due to information received from RNS-B, 3G_MSC‑B shall transfer this clearing indication to 3G_MSC‑A, to clear its connection with RNS-B, to terminate the dialogue with 3G_MSC‑A through the E‑interface, and to release its circuit connection with 3G_MSC‑A, if any. In the same way, the release of the connection to its RNS-B, is initiated by 3G_MSC‑B, when the dialogue with 3G_MSC‑A ends normally and a release is received from the circuit connection with 3G_MSC‑A, if any, or when the dialogue with the 3G_MSC‑A ends abnormally.\nWhen a release is received by 3G_MSC‑B for the circuit connection with 3G_MSC‑A then 3G_MSC‑B shall release the circuit connection.\nIn the Inter-system UMTS to GSM Inter-3G_MSC handover case, the role of 3G_MSC‑B (3G_MSC‑B') is only to provide radio resources control within its area. This means that 3G_MSC‑B keeps control of the radio resources connection and release towards BSS-B. 3G_MSC‑B will do some processing on the BSSMAP information received on the E-interface or the BSSMAP information received on the A-interface whereas it will relay the DTAP information transparently between A‑interface and E-interface. 3G_MSC‑A initiates and drives a subset of BSSMAP procedures towards 3G_MSC‑B, while 3G_MSC‑B controls them towards its BSSs to the extent that 3G_MSC‑B is responsible for the connections of its BSSs. The release of the dedicated resources between 3G_MSC‑B and BSS-B is under the responsibility of 3G_MSC‑B and BSS‑B, and is not directly controlled by 3G_MSC‑A. When clearing is to be performed due to information received from BSS-B, 3G_MSC‑B shall transfer this clearing indication to 3G_MSC‑A, to clear its connection with BSS-B, to terminate the dialogue with 3G_MSC‑A through the E‑interface, and to release its circuit connection with MSC‑A, if any. In the same way, the release of the connection to its BSS-B, is initiated by 3G_MSC‑B, when the dialogue with 3G_MSC‑A ends normally and a release is received from the circuit connection with 3G_MSC‑A, if any, or when the dialogue with the MSC‑A ends abnormally.\nWhen a release is received by 3G_MSC‑B for the circuit connection with 3G_MSC‑A then 3G_MSC‑B shall release the circuit connection.\nIn the Inter-system GSM to UMTS Inter-3G_MSC handover case, the role of 3G_MSC‑B (3G_MSC‑B') is only to provide radio resources control within its area. This means that 3G_MSC‑B keeps control of the radio resources connection and release towards RNS-B. 3G_MSC‑B will do some processing on the BSSMAP information received on the E-interface or the RANAP information received on the Iu-interface whereas it will relay the Direct Transfer information transparently between Iu‑interface and E-interface. MSC‑A initiates and drives a subset of BSSMAP procedures towards 3G_MSC‑B, while 3G_MSC‑B controls them towards its RNSs to the extent that 3G_MSC‑B is responsible for the connections of its RNSs. The release of the dedicated resources between 3G_MSC‑B and RNS-B is under the responsibility of 3G_MSC‑B and RNS‑B, and is not directly controlled by MSC‑A. When clearing is to be performed due to information received from RNS-B, 3G_MSC‑B shall transfer this clearing indication to MSC‑A, to clear its connection with RNS-B, to terminate the dialogue with MSC‑A through the E‑interface, and to release its circuit connection with MSC‑A, if any. In the same way, the release of the connection to its RNS-B, is initiated by 3G_MSC‑B, when the dialogue with MSC‑A ends normally and a release is received from the circuit connection with MSC‑A, if any, or when the dialogue with the MSC‑A ends abnormally.\nWhen a release is received by 3G_MSC‑B for the circuit connection with MSC‑A then 3G_MSC‑B shall release the circuit connection.\nAt intra-PLMN handover/relocation, 3G_MSC-B shall send Service Handover related information to the BSC/RNC if and only if this Service Handover information is received from 3G_MSC-A. 3G_MSC-B shall not modify Service Handover related information received from a 3G_MSC-A within the same PLMN.\nFor network sharing (see 3GPP TS 25.401 [20], clause 7.2.3) when SNA information is received by 3G_MSC-B from 3G_MSC-A, 3G MSC-B shall send the SNA information to the RNS.\nIf 3G_MSC-B does not support the optional supplementary service Multicall (see 3GPP TS 23.135 [17]) and 3G_MSC-A requests to relocate multiple bearers, 3G_MSC-B shall indicate that it does not support multiple bearers to 3G_MSC-A.\nIf 3G_MSC-B supports the optional supplementary service Multicall (see 3GPP TS 23.135 [17]) and UE is engaged with multiple bearers the following description applies:\n-\tIn the basic relocation case, the 3G_MSC-B shall be able to allocate a Handover Number for each bearer. The 3G_MSC-B shall also be able to select some bearers to be handed over according to the priority level defined as RAB parameters in 3GPP TS 25.413 [11] so that the number of bearers will fulfill the maximum number of bearers supported by the 3G_MSC-B. If a selection has to be made between bearers of the same priority level, then the selection criteria are implementation dependent.\n-\tIn the Intra-3G_MSC relocation case, the 3G_MSC-B tries to relocate all bearers to a new RNS.\n-\tIn the subsequent relocation back to the 3G_MSC-A or to a third 3G_MSC-B' case, the 3G_MSC-B tries to request to the 3G_MSC-A to relocate all bearers to the 3G_MSC-A or to the 3G_MSC-B'.\n-\tIn the Intra-3G_MSC inter-system UMTS to GSM handover case and the subsequent inter-system UMTS to GSM handover back to the 3G_MSC-A or to a third MSC-B' case, the 3G_MSC-B shall be able to select one bearer to be handed over according to 3GPP TS 22.129 [9] and tries to handover the selected bearer.\nIf 3G_MSC-B supports the \"Provision of UE Specific Behaviour Information to Network Entities\" (see 3GPP TS 23.195 [21]), and if it received UESBI-Iu from MSC-A or 3G_MSC-A during the basic inter-MSC handover/relocation, then 3G_MSC-B shall store the UESBI-Iu and forward it to RNS-B during basic inter-MSC handover/relocation and subsequent intra-3G_MSC-B handover/relocation.\nIf 3G_MSC-B supports SCUDIF calls (see 3GPP TS 23.172 [22]), and if it received information of alternative radio access bearer from 3G_MSC-A during the basic inter-MSC handover/relocation or assignment, then 3G_MSC-B shall store that information and forward it to RNS-B during basic inter-MSC handover/relocation or assignment and subsequent intra-3G_MSC-B handover/relocation.\n3G_MSC-B may support subsequent inter-system handover or SRNS relocation to a CSG cell. If 3G_MSC-B supports handover/relocation to a CSG cell, the serving BSS or RNS is served by 3G_MSC-B and provides a CSG ID for the target cell, and the call is not an emergency call, then 3G_MSC-B checks the CSG membership of the UE for the target cell using the CSG subscription data provided by the anchor MSC-A or 3G_MSC-A during the basic inter-MSC handover/relocation before proceeding with the subsequent handover/relocation procedure. If there is no subscription data for this CSG ID or the CSG subscription for the CSG ID has expired, 3G_MSC-B considers the membership check as failed.\nNOTE 1:\tIf 3G_MSC-B does not support CSG membership checking, and a CSG cell is configured as possible handover target, 3G_MSC-B will proceed with the subsequent handover to the CSG cell. If the CSG cell is not configured as possible handover target, 3G_MSC-B will not proceed with the handover.\nFor subsequent handover/relocation of an emergency call to a CSG cell, 3G_MSC-B shall skip the CSG membership check and proceed with the handover/relocation procedure.\nFor subsequent inter-PLMN handover/relocation to a CSG cell, if the anchor MSC-A or 3G_MSC-A provided a CSG ID list for the target PLMN during the basic inter-MSC handover/relocation, 3G_MSC-B shall validate the CSG membership of the UE in the target CSG cell using the CSG ID list for the target PLMN.\nNOTE 2:\tDue to certain restrictions in the access stratum, inter-PLMN handover to a CSG cell in a PLMN which is not an equivalent PLMN for the UE is not supported; therefore, the target PLMN will always be an equivalent PLMN.\nBased on operator's configuration, if the anchor MSC-A or 3G_MSC-A provided only a CSG ID list for the PLMN of 3G_MSC-B, the 3G_MSC-B may allow the handover/relocation by validating the CSG membership of the UE in the target CSG cell using this CSG ID list. Otherwise, 3G_MSC-B shall reject the handover/relocation due to no CSG subscription information of the target PLMN-ID available.\nNOTE 3:\tIf 3G_MSC-B uses the CSG ID list of the PLMN of 3G_MSC-B for membership validation, as the UE is using the CSG ID list of the equivalent PLMN, inter-PLMN handover to a CSG cell of an equivalent PLMN can only occur if the CSG ID of the cell is both in the CSG ID list of the PLMN of 3G_MSC-B which is used by 3G_MSC-B and in the CSG ID list of the equivalent PLMN which is used by the UE. If MSC-A or 3G_MSC-A provided a CSG ID list for the target PLMN of the subsequent inter-MSC handover, this restriction does not apply.",

Depending on the support for soft or hard handover the Intra-MSC and Inter-MSC handover may differ.\nIn the case of an ongoing GSM voice group call (see 3GPP TS 43.068 [3]) the criteria described above shall only apply to the mobile station currently assigned the uplink and other users with a dedicated connection, no actions shall be taken for the listening users.",

Detailed explanation of these procedures can be found in 3GPP TS 48.008 [5] and 3GPP TS 24.008 [10].\nThere are three types of GSM handover that involve a single BSS and a single MSC. These are \"Internal Handover\", \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support\"  and\" External Handover\".\nAn \"Internal Handover\" takes place between channels on a cell or cells controlled by a single BSS, without reference to the MSC, although the MSC maybe informed of its occurrence after completion. This typical case can be used by the BSS e.g. if the A-Interface User Plane is not to be modified. This \"Internal Handover\" may take place with AoTDM or with AoIP and is not considered in the present document.\nA \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support\" shall only be used if AoIP is supported by both MSC and BSS and if the A-Interface User Plane has to be modified. In that case the BSS or the MSC may initiate a \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support\" procedure as described in detail in clause 6.3 in this document.\nNOTE:\tFrom Core Network perspective this \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support\" is an \"External Handover\", because the MSC is actively involved, although it is called \"Internal Handover\" in 3GPP TS 48.008, because the call stays within one BSS.\nHandovers between channels on the same cell or between cells on the same BSS which are controlled by the MSC (as defined prior to the introduction of AoIP) are termed \"External Handovers\" and use identical procedures to those for Inter-BSS-Intra-MSC handovers.  \"External Handovers\" are also specified with AoIP User Plane transport, for example the handover from speech to data services.Handovers from a BSS to an RNS controlled by the same 3G_MSC are intra-3G_MSC GSM to UMTS handovers. Handovers from an RNS to a BSS controlled by the same 3G_MSC are intra-3G_MSC UMTS to GSM handovers.\nThere are two types of handover in UMTS: soft handover and hard handover. The first one is fully performed within UTRAN, without involving the core network. The second one may be also performed within UTRAN or GERAN, or between GERAN and UTRAN, or the core network may be involved if the Iur or Iur-g interface between RNSs does not exist. This case of hard handover involving the core network is covered in the present document, together with SRNS relocation with Iur or Iur-g interface.",

      "content": "The procedure for a successful External Intra-MSC handover is shown in figure 7. It is assumed that selection of a candidate MS has already taken place within the BSS based upon the criteria presented in clause 5. The exact algorithm, in the BSS, for determining a candidate MS is not addressed in the present document. The procedures discussed do not make use of the Mobile Application Part (MAP), represented by signalling function 4 in figure 2 and figure 3. The procedure described in this clause covers case i).\nFigure 7: Basic External Intra-MSC Handover Procedure\nThe successful operation of the procedure is as follows. When the BSS (BSS-A), currently supporting the MS, determines that the MS requires to be handed over it will send an A‑HANDOVER-REQUIRED message to the MSC (MSC‑A). The A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message shall contain a list of cells, or a single cell, to which the MS can be handed over. The list of cells shall be given in order of preference based upon operator determined criteria (These criteria are not addressed within the present document and are operator dependent). When the MSC‑A receives the A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message it shall begin the process of handing over the MS to a new BSS (BSS-B). (NOTE: BSS-A and BSS-B maybe the same BSS). The MSC‑A shall generate an A-HANDOVER-REQUEST message to the selected BSS (BSS-B). When BSS-B receives the A‑HANDOVER-REQUEST message it shall take the necessary action to allow the MS to access the radio resource of BSS-B, this is detailed in 3GPP TS 48.058 [6] and in 3GPP TS 45.008 [4]. The switching of the radio resource through the necessary terrestrial resources is detailed in 3GPP TS 24.008 [10] and 3GPP TS 48.008 [5].\nOnce resource allocation has been completed by BSS-B it shall return an A-HANDOVER-REQUEST-ACK. to MSC‑A. When this message is received by MSC‑A it shall begin the process of instructing the MS to tune to a new dedicated radio resource. An A-HANDOVER-COMMAND will be sent by the MSC‑A to BSS-A. On receipt of the A-HANDOVER-COMMAND message BSS-A will send the radio interface message RI-HANDOVER-COMMAND, containing a Handover Reference number previously allocated by BSS-B, to the MS. The MS will then access the new radio resource using the Handover Reference number contained in the RI-HANDOVER-ACCESS message. The number will be checked by BSS-B to ensure it is as expected and the correct MS has been captured. If this is the correct MS then the BSS-B shall send an A-HANDOVER-DETECT to MSC‑A. When the MS is successfully communicating with the BSS-B a RI-HANDOVER-COMPLETE message will be sent by the MS to BSS-B. The BSS-B will then send an A-HANDOVER-COMPLETE message to MSC‑A.\nNOTE:\tThe A-HANDOVER-REQUEST-ACK from BSS-B contains the complete Radio Interface message that shall be sent by BSS-A to the MS in the RI-HANDOVER-COMMAND, MSC‑A transparently passes this radio interface message onto BSS‑A.\nAfter MSC‑A has received the A-HANDOVER-COMPLETE message from BSS-B it shall begin to release the resources allocated on BSS-A. In figure 7 the resource is released by using the A‑CLEAR-COMMAND sequence.\nIn the case of ongoing GSM voice group calls the clearing of resources on BSS-A shall not be used if the resources are still be used on the down link.\nIf a failure occurs during the handover attempt, for example A-HANDOVER-FAILURE returned from BSS-A or BSS-B, then MSC‑A will terminate the handover to BSS-B. Under these conditions MSC‑A may optionally take one of a number of actions:\ni)\tretry the handover to the same cell;\nii)\tselect the next cell from the list contained in the A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message and attempt a handover to the new cell;\niii)\tawait the next A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message;\niv)\tsend an A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED-REJECT to BSS-A, if an A-HANDOVER-COMMAND has not already been sent.\nThe exact action taken is dependent on whether the failure occurs before or after the A-HANDOVER-COMMAND has been sent.\nIn all cases the existing connection to the MS shall not be cleared except in the case of expiry of the timer for receipt of A-HANDOVER-COMPLETE.\nDuring the period that the MS is not in communication with the network MSC‑A shall queue all appropriate messages. All messages shall be delivered to the MS once communication is resumed . In the case of an Intra-MSC handover on MSC‑B then the messages shall be queued by MSC‑B.\nIn the case of ongoing GSM voice group calls if a failure occurs when handing over a user on a dedicated channel then the procedures described above may optionally be applied.\nFor the case of subsequent Inter-BSS Intra-MSC-B or Inter-BSS Intra-3G_MSC-B handover the following applies:\nIf handover to an A over IP capable BSS-B is performed, MSC-B/3G_MSC-B includes a Codec List (MSC preferred) in the A-HANDOVER-REQUEST message to BSS-B. MSC-B/3G_MSC-B may select the codecs for the Codec List (MSC preferred) from the channel type information and the AoIP-Supported Codecs List (Anchor), if this list was provided by MSC-A/3G_MSC-A in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request. For a detailed description of the handling of these codec lists by MSC-A/3G_MSC-A and MSC-B/3G_MSC-B see 3GPP TS 23.153 [25]. If the AoIP-Supported Codecs List (Anchor) was not provided or MSC‑B/3G_MSC-B does not support the selection of codecs from the AoIP-Supported Codecs List (Anchor), then MSC‑B/3G_MSC-B shall create the Codec List (MSC preferred) using the channel type information received from MSC‑A/3G_MSC-A in the A-HANDOVER-REQUEST message included in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request.\nAfter successful completion of the Intra-MSC-B handover or Intra-3G_MSC-B handover, if MSC-B/3G_MSC-B received the AoIP-Supported Codecs List (Anchor), MSC-B/3G_MSC-B may send the new AoIP-Selected Codec (Target) and AoIP-Available Codecs List (MAP) to MSC-A/3G_MSC-A in the MAP-PROCESS-ACCESS-SIGNALLING request transporting the A‑HANDOVER-PERFORMED message, if the following conditions are fulfilled: MSC-B/3G_MSC-B created a Codec List (MSC preferred) from the AoIP-Supported Codecs List (Anchor) received from MSC-A/3G_MSC-A, the target BSS-B uses A interface over IP and BSS-B does not insert a transcoder.",

The 3G_MSC‑A shall generate an IU-RELOCATION-REQUEST message to the selected RNS (RNS-B). For the relocation of a speech call to UTRAN Iu mode, 3G_MSC‑A shall include the NAS Synch Indicator in the Iu-RELOCATION-REQUEST, if the Iu Selected codec to be used after the relocation is different from the Iu Currently used codec.\nIf 3G_MSC-A supports SRNS Relocation to a CSG cell and RNS-A includes a CSG ID for the target cell in the IU-RELOCATION-REQUIRED message, then 3G_MSC-A shall check the CSG membership of the UE for the target cell as described in clause 4.3.1 before generating the Iu-RELOCATION-REQUEST message. If the UE fails the CSG membership check and the target cell is a CSG cell, 3G_MSC-A shall send an IU-RELOCATION-PREPARATION-FAILURE to RNS-A.\nWhen RNS-B receives the IU-RELOCATION-REQUEST message it shall take the necessary action to establish the new Iu transport bearers for each Radio Access Bearer related to 3G_MSC‑A for the UE in question, this is detailed in the 3GPP TS 25.430 series and 3GPP TS 25.413 [11].\nOnce resource allocation has been completed by RNS-B it shall return an IU-RELOCATION-REQUEST-ACKNOWLEDGE to 3G_MSC‑A. When this message is received by 3G_MSC‑A, and 3G_MSC‑A is ready for the move in Serving RNS functionality, it shall indicate the completion of the preparation phase on the core network side for the SRNS Relocation. An IU-RELOCATION-COMMAND message is sent by 3G_MSC‑A to RNS-A. RNS-A acts as follows:\ni)\tif the procedure is a SRNS Relocation without change of radio resources, which means that the Iur interface between RNS-A and RNS-B can be used for the procedure, the RNS-A shall send IUR-SRNS-RELOCATION-COMMIT message to the RNS-B to trigger the Relocation execution. See figure 10.\nii)\tif the procedure is a SRNS Relocation with change of radio resources, which means that the Iur interface between RNS-A and RNS-B is not used for the procedure, the RNS-A shall trigger the handover procedure on the air interface by sending the RRC-HANDOVER-COMMAND to the UE. The UE will then access the new radio resources. See figure 11.\nNOTE:\tThe IU-RELOCATION-REQUEST-ACKNOWLEDGE from RNS-B may optionally contain a transparent container, which is transferred by 3G_MSC‑A to the RNS-A using the IU‑RELOCATION-COMMAND message.\nWhen the relocation execution trigger is received, RNS-B shall then take the necessary action to assume the role of Serving RNS and shall send an IU-RELOCATION-DETECT message to 3G_MSC‑A. When the UE is successfully in communication with the RNS-B, then RNS-B shall send an IU-RELOCATION-COMPLETE message to 3G_MSC‑A.\nAfter 3G_MSC‑A has received the IU-RELOCATION-COMPLETE message from RNS-B, it shall begin to release the resources associated to the RNS-A. In figures 10 and 11, the resources are released by using the IU‑RELEASE‑COMMAND sequence.\nIf a failure occurs during the SRNS Relocation attempt, then 3G_MSC‑A will terminate the relocation to RNS-B. For example, if IU-RELOCATION-FAILURE is returned from RNS-B then 3G_MSC‑A will terminate the relocation to RNS-B and send IU-RELOCATION-PREPARATION-FAILURE to RNS-A. If IU-RELOCATION-CANCEL is returned from RNS-A, then 3G_MSC‑A will terminate the relocation to RNS-B and send IU-RELOCATION-CANCEL-ACKNOWLEDGE to RNS-A.\nIn all cases the existing connection to the UE shall not be cleared except in the case of expiry of the timer for receipt of Iu-RELOCATION-COMPLETE.\nDuring the period that the UE is not in communication with the network, 3G_MSC‑A shall queue all appropriate messages. All messages shall be delivered to the UE once communication is resumed. In the case of an Intra-3G_MSC SRNS Relocation (with or without change of  radio resources) on 3G_MSC‑B, then the messages shall be queued by 3G_MSC‑B.",

It is therefore in average slower and more resource demanding than the BSS Internal Handover without MSC support. In order to guarantee a high radio network performance the MSC needs to react quickly and handle this handover with high priority.\nThe \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC support\" applies only if both BSS and Core Network support the AoIP procedures and messages, and an A-Interface User Plane connection has been established beforehand. The procedures and messages for this \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC support\" are described in 3GPP TS 48.008 [5].\nThe \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support\" can be initiated either:\na)\tby the BSS, by sending the A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message; or:\nb)\tby the serving MSC, by sending the A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-ENQUIRY message.",

      "content": "The BSS-initiated \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support\" starts with an A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message from the BSS to the serving MSC, for further details see 3GPP TS 48.008 [5], clause 3.1.5c. An example sequence is shown in figure 6.3.2.1\nFigure 6.3.2.1: BSS-Initiated Internal Handover Execution\nThe A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message contains a reason for the required handover and the currently valid Codec List (BSS Supported). It shall also contain an AoIP Transport Layer Address and UDP Port, if the BSS requires an IP-based target User Plane. The Codec List (BSS supported) contains the key requirements from the BSS, like target Codec Type(s), target Codec Configuration(s) and target A-interface Type(s) (TDM and/or IP),  and may contain the required Redundancy Level for CSData, etc.\nWhen sending the A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message the BSS starts a timer \"T25\" (3GPP TS 48.008 [5]) and it expects an answer from the serving MSC within that timer period. If \"T25\" (3GPP TS 48.008 [5]) expires before the MSC has answered, then the BSS ignores any subsequent (late) answer from the serving MSC after expiry of timer \"T25\" (3GPP TS 48.008 [5]). The BSS will not send any new A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message before timer \"T25\" (3GPP TS 48.008 [5]) has expired or before the Internal Handover Preparation is terminated by other reasons.\nWhen the serving MSC receives the A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message it shall start timer T105 (see clause 9.3A). The serving MSC shall not send any answer to the BSS after timer T105 has expired. Both timers (\"T25\" – 3GPP TS 48.008 [5] and T105) shall be configured (by O&M) to minimise the likelihood that the answer from serving MSC to BSS crosses with a new or repeated A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message from the BSS to the serving MSC, i.e. the timer T105 shall always expire before \"T25\" (3GPP TS 48.008 [5]) expires.\nIf the serving MSC is able to fulfil the required \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support\", then it shall generate and send an A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-COMMAND message to the BSS and stop timer T105. This answer shall contain the exact new A-Interface User Plane parameters, e.g. Codec Type, Codec Configuration, A-Interface Type, either TDM Circuit Identity Code or IP Transport Layer Address and UDP Port (see 3GPP TS 48.008 [5]). While T25 is still running the BSS can either accept or reject the A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-COMMAND.\nWhen the BSS receives the A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-COMMAND message it takes the necessary action to allow the MS to access the radio resource of the new cell in BSS, this is detailed in 3GPP TS 48.058 [6] and in 3GPP TS 45.008 [4]. The switching of the radio resource through the necessary terrestrial resources is detailed in 3GPP TS 44.018 [28] and 3GPP TS 48.008 [5]. On receipt of the A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-COMMAND message the BSS will send e.g. the radio interface message RI-HANDOVER-COMMAND, containing a Handover Reference number previously allocated to the MS. The MS will then access the new radio resource using the Handover Reference number contained in the RI-HANDOVER-ACCESS message. The number will be checked by BSS to ensure it is as expected and the correct MS has been captured.\nAs BSS and MS proceed with the handover the BSS may send an A-HANDOVER-DETECT message to the serving MSC to enable fast User Plane switching on the Core Network side. As soon as the MS and BSS have completed the handover the BSS send an A-HANDOVER-COMPLETE message to serving MSC. Both BSS and serving MSC will then release the no longer needed BSS and Core Network resources.\nIf the serving MSC is unable to support the required Internal Handover due to whatever reason then it shall send an A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-REQUIRED-REJECT message to the BSS (if T105 has not expired already). The serving MSC shall not send an A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-REQUIRED-REJECT message after an A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-COMMAND has been sent to the BSS.\nIf a failure occurs during the handover attempt and the BSS sends an A-HANDOVER-FAILURE message, then the serving MSC shall terminate the handover and shall revert back to using the resources used before the handover attempt was made.\nThe serving MSC shall supervise the \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support\" procedure after sending the A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-COMMAND using the same timer (T102) as used for Intra-MSC handover, see clauses 9.3 and 11.3.\nIn all cases the existing connection to the MS shall not be cleared, except in the case of expiry of the timer T102 before receipt of A-HANDOVER-COMPLETE.\nWhilst the MS is not in communication with the Core Network (i.e. in the time span between sending of A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-COMMAND and the reception of A-HANDOVER-COMPLETE or an A-HANDOVER FAILURE) the serving MSC shall queue all appropriate messages towards the MS. All these messages shall be delivered to the MS once the communication is resumed.\nFor the case of subsequent Intra-BSS handover with support from MSC-B or 3G_MSC-B the following applies:\nAfter successful completion of the Intra-BSS handover, if MSC-B/3G_MSC-B received the AoIP-Supported Codecs List (Anchor), MSC-B/3G_MSC-B may send the new AoIP-Selected Codec (Target) and AoIP-Available Codecs List (MAP) to MSC-A/3G_MSC-A in the MAP-PROCESS-ACCESS-SIGNALLING request transporting the A‑HANDOVER-PERFORMED message, if the following conditions are fulfilled: MSC-B/3G_MSC-B created a Codec List (MSC preferred) from the AoIP-Supported Codecs List (Anchor) received from MSC-A/3G_MSC-A, the BSS uses A interface over IP and the BSS does not insert a transcoder.",

The applicable handover related message shall always appear as the first message;\nc)\tduring the handover resource allocation for subsequent inter-MSC handover according to clauses 7.3 and 7.4, it is allowed to transfer either DTAP or RANAP Direct Transfer messages on the E-Interface between MSC-A and MSC-B.

The procedure described in this clause makes use of messages from the 3GPP TS 48.008 [5] and of the transport mechanism from the Mobile Application Part (MAP) (3GPP TS 29.002 [12]). After an Inter-MSC handover further Intra-MSC handovers may occur on MSC‑B, these handovers will follow the procedures specified in the previous clause.\nNOTE 1:\tCan be sent at any time after the reception of IAM.\nFigure 12: Basic Handover Procedure requiring a circuit connection\nThe handover is initiated as described in clause 6.1. (This is represented by A-HO-REQUIRED in figure 12. Upon receipt of the A-HO-REQUIRED from BSS-A, MSC‑A shall send a MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request to MSC‑B including a complete A-HO-REQUEST message.\nNOTE:\tMSC‑A shall not send further MAP‑PREPARE‑HANDOVER requests while a MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response is pending or before any timeouts.\nThe MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request shall carry in the A‑HO-REQUEST all information needed by MSC‑B for allocating a radio channel, see 3GPP TS 48.008 [5]. For compatibility reasons, the MAP‑PREPARE-HANDOVER request will also identify the cell to which the call is to be handed over. For speech calls, MSC-A shall also include the Iu Supported Codecs List to be used by MSC-B for subsequent intra-MSC-B intersystem handover to UMTS and intra-MSC-B SRNS relocation.\nIf MSC-A supports A interface over IP, then for speech calls MSC-A may include the AoIP-Supported Codecs List (Anchor) in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request. If handover to an A over IP capable BSS-B is performed, MSC-B shall include a Codec List (MSC preferred) in the A-HO-REQUEST message to BSS-B. MSC-B may select the codecs for the Codec List (MSC preferred) from the channel type information and the AoIP-Supported Codecs List (Anchor), if this list was provided by MSC-A in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request. For a detailed description of the handling of these codec lists by MSC-A and MSC-B see 3GPP TS 23.153 [25]. If the AoIP-Supported Codecs List was not provided or MSC-B does not support the selection of codecs from the AoIP-Supported Codecs List (Anchor), then MSC-B shall create the Codec List (MSC preferred) using the channel type information received from MSC-A in the A-HO-REQUEST message included in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request.\nIf MSC-A supports handover to a CSG cell, the target cell belongs to the registered PLMN or an equivalent PLMN, and the HLR or the CSS provided CSG subscription data, MSC-A shall include the CSG subscription data for the registered PLMN and, if available, for the equivalent PLMNs in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request.\nMSC‑B will return the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response after having retrieved a Handover Number from its associated VLR (exchange of the messages MAP-allocate-handover-number request and MAP-send-handover-report request). The Handover Number shall be used for routing the connection of the call from MSC‑A to MSC‑B. If a traffic channel is available in MSC‑B the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response, sent to MSC‑A will contain the complete A‑HO‑REQUEST-ACKNOWLEDGE message received from BSS-B, containing the radio resources definition to be sent by BSS-A to the MS and possible extra BSSMAP information, amended by MSC‑B due to the possible interworking between the BSSMAP protocol carried on the E-interface and the BSSMAP protocol used on the A‑interface. If the traffic channel allocation is queued by BSS-B, the A-QUEUING-INDICATION may optionaly be sent back to MSC‑A. The further traffic channel allocation result (A-HO-REQUEST-ACK or A-HO-FAILURE) will be transferred to MSC‑A using the MAP-PROCESS-ACCESS-SIGNALLING request. If the traffic channel allocation is not possible, the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response containing an A-HO-FAILURE will be sent to MSC‑A. MSC‑B will do the same if a fault is detected on the identity of the cell where the call has to be handed over. MSC‑B simply reports the events related to the dialogue. It is up to MSC‑A to decide the action to perform if it receives negative responses or the operation fails due to the expiry of the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER timer.\nIf A interface over IP is supported, then for speech calls via an A over IP capable BSS-B the selection of the speech codec shall be as described in 3GPP TS 48.008 [5], and if no transcoder is inserted in the BSS-B then MSC-B shall insert a transcoder.\nIf MSC‑A provided an AoIP-Supported Codecs List (Anchor) in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request and MSC‑B selected the codecs for the Codec List (MSC preferred) from the AoIP-Supported Codecs List (Anchor), MSC‑B may send the AoIP-Selected Codec (Target) and AoIP-Available Codecs List (MAP) to MSC-A in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response.\nIf BSS-B does not support A interface over IP or MSC-A did not include the AoIP-Supported Codecs List (Anchor) in the MAP-PREPARE HANDOVER request, then MSC-B shall not include the AoIP-Selected Codec (Target) and AoIP‑Available Codecs List (MAP) in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response. Reception of AoIP-Selected Codec (Target) and AoIP Available Codecs List (MAP) from MSC-B with the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response indicates to MSC-A that the target access supports A interface over IP.\nIf an error related to the TCAP dialogue or to the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request is returned from MSC‑B, this will be indicated to MSC‑A and MSC‑A will terminate the handover attempt. MSC‑A may retry the handover attempt using the cell identity list, if provided, or may reject the handover attempt towards BSS-A. The existing connection to the MS shall not be cleared.\nWhen the A-HO-REQUEST-ACKNOWLEDGE has been received, MSC‑A shall establish a circuit between MSC‑A and MSC‑B by signalling procedures supported by the network. In figure 12 this is illustrated by the messages IAM (Initial Address Message) and ACM (Address Complete Message) of Signalling System no 7. MSC‑B awaits the capturing of the MS (clause 6.1) on the radio path when the ACM is sent and MSC‑A initiates the handover execution when ACM is received (illustrated by the A-HO-COMMAND and described in the clause 6.1.\nIf the BSS-A was connected via an A interface over IP and no transcoding performed in the BSS then MSC-A shall remove the transcoder between the MSC and the other party.\nMSC‑B transfers to MSC‑A the acknowledgement received from the correct MS (A-HO-DETECT/A-HO-COMPLETE). The A-HO-DETECT, if received, is transferred to MSC‑A using the MAP-PROCESS-ACCESS-SIGNALLING request. The A-HO-COMPLETE, when received from the correct MS, is included in the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL request and sent back to MSC‑A. The circuit is through-connected in MSC‑A when the A-HO-DETECT or the A-HO-COMPLETE is received from MSC‑B. The old radio channel is released when the A-HO-COMPLETE message is received from MSC‑B. The sending of the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL request starts the MAP supervision timer for the MAP dialogue between MSC‑A and MSC‑B. When the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL request including the A-HO-COMPLETE message is received in MSC‑A the resources in BSS-A shall be cleared.\nIn order not to conflict with the PSTN/ISDN signalling system(s) used between MSC‑A and MSC‑B, MSC‑B must generate an answer signal when A-HO-DETECT/COMPLETE is received.\nMSC‑B shall release the Handover Number when the circuit between MSC‑A and MSC‑B has been established.\nIf the circuit between MSC‑A and MSC‑B cannot be established (e.g. an unsuccessful backward message is received instead of ACM). MSC‑A terminates the inter-MSC handover attempt by sending an appropriate MAP message, for example an ABORT. MSC‑A may retry the handover at this point, see clause 6.1.\nMSC‑A shall retain overall call control until the call is cleared by the fixed subscriber or the MS and there is no further call control functions to be performed (e.g. servicing waiting calls, echo cancellers).\nWhen MSC‑A clears the call to the MS it also clears the call control functions in MSC‑A and sends the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL response to release the MAP resources in MSC‑B.\nMSC‑A may terminate the procedure at any time by sending an appropriate MAP message to MSC‑B. If establishment of the circuit between MSC‑A and MSC‑B has been initiated, the circuit must also be cleared.\nThe handover will be aborted by MSC‑A if it detects clearing or interruption of the radio path before the call has been established on MSC‑B.",

      "content": "The basic handover procedures to be used when no circuit connection is required by MSC‑A are similar to those described in clause 7.1 for circuit switched calls. The main differences to the procedures described in clause 7.1 relate to the establishment of circuits between the network entities and the Handover Number allocation.\nIn the case of ongoing GSM voice group calls the circuit connections are already established therefore the procedures described in this clause are also applicable. When applied to ongoing voice group calls the clearing of resources on BSS-A shall not be used if the resources are still be used on the down link. Consequently the A-CLEAR-COMMAND message shall not be sent, but an HANDOVER-SUCCEEDED message shall be sent.\nIn the case of basic handover, MSC‑A shall specify to MSC‑B that no Handover Number is required in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request (see 3GPP TS 29.002 [12]). As for the basic handover using a circuit connection, the A-HO-REQUEST is transmitted at the same time. Any subsequent Handover Number allocation procedure will not be invoked until the completion of the basic handover procedure (see clause: Subsequent Channel Assignment using a circuit connection). MSC‑B shall then perform the radio resources allocation as described in clause 7.1. The MAP‑PREPARE-HANDOVER response shall be returned to MSC‑A including either the response of the radio resources allocation request received from BSS-B (A-HO-REQUEST-ACKNOWLEDGE/A-HO-FAILURE with possible extra BSSMAP information. These extra information are amended by MSC‑B due to the possible interworking between the BSSMAP protocol carried on the E-interface and the BSSMAP protocol used on the A-interface) or potentially the A-QUEUING-INDICATION . The basic handover procedure will continue as described in clause 7.1 except that no circuit connection will be established towards MSC‑B.\nThe relevant case for the basic handover without circuit connection is shown in figure 13. As can be seen the major differences to the equivalent figure 12 is the omission of any circuit establishment messaging and the omission of handover number allocation signalling.\nFigure 13: Basic Handover Procedure without circuit connection",

(NOTE: MSC‑B shall not send further MAP-PREPARE-SUBSEQUENT-HANDOVER requests while a handover attempt is pending or before any timeouts). Since MSC‑A is the call controlling MSC, this MSC needs no Handover Number for routing purposes; MSC‑A can immediately initiate the search for a free radio channel.\nWhen a radio channel can be assigned, MSC‑A shall return in the MAP-PREPARE-SUBSEQUENT-HANDOVER response the complete A-HO-REQUEST-ACKNOWLEDGE message received from the BSS-B and possible extra BSSMAP information, amended by MSC‑A due to the possible interworking between the BSSMAP protocol carried on the E-interface and the BSSMAP protocol used on the A-interface. If the traffic channel allocation is queued by BSS-B, the A-QUEUING-INDICATION may optionaly be sent back to MSC‑B.

This is illustrated in figure 14 by the A-HO-COMMAND message. The operation is successfully completed when MSC‑A receives the A-HO-COMPLETE message.\nAfter handover MSC‑A shall release the circuit to MSC‑B.\nMSC‑A must also terminate the MAP procedure for the basic handover between MSC‑A and MSC‑B by sending an appropriate MAP message.

For a detailed description of the handling of this codec list by MSC-A and MSC-B' see 3GPP TS 23.153 [25].\nWhen MSC‑A receives the ACM from MSC‑B', MSC‑A informs MSC‑B that MSC‑B' has successfully allocated the radio resources on BSS-B' side by sending the MAP-PREPARE-SUBSEQUENT-HANDOVER response containing the complete A-HO-REQUEST-ACKNOWLEDGE received from BSS-B' and possible extra BSSMAP information, amended by MSC‑A due to the possible interworking between the BSSMAP protocol carried on the E-interface between MSC‑A and MSC‑B' and the BSSMAP protocol carried on the E-interface between MSC‑A and MSC‑B.

The first, as described in clauses 8.1.1 and 8.1.3 respectively, provides for a circuit connection between 3G_MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B. The second, as described in clauses 8.1.2 and 8.1.4 respectively, provides for a Basic and Subsequent Handover without the provision of a circuit connection between 3G_MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B. 3G_MSC can also be a pure GSM MSC.\nIn all the above mentioned clauses, the following principles apply:\na)\tduring the handover resource allocation, except for the messages explicitly indicated in b and c below, only the handover related messages that are part of the applicable BSSAP subset - as defined in 3GPP TS 49.008 [7] - shall be transferred on the E-interface;\nb)\tthe trace related messages that are part of the applicable BSSAP subset - as defined in 3GPP TS 49.008 [7]- can be sent by the 3G_MSC‑A on the E-interface after successful handover resource allocation.

The applicable handover related message shall always appear as the first message;\nc)\tduring the handover resource allocation for subsequent inter-MSC inter-system handover according to clauses 8.1.3 and 8.1.4, it is allowed to transfer either DTAP or RANAP Direct Transfer messages on the E-Interface between 3G_MSC-A and 3G_MSC-B. RANAP Direct Transfer messages shall be used for this purpose if and only if the basic handover procedure was an inter MSC SRNS relocation;\nd)\tduring the handover execution, i.e. while the UE/MS is not in communication with the network, the 3G_MSC‑A shall queue all outgoing BSSAP or RANAP messages until the communication with the UE/MS is resumed;\ne)\tduring the execution of a basic inter-system inter-MSC handover to MSC-B or a subsequent inter-system inter-MSC handover to a third MSC-B', only the handover related messages and the A-Clear-Request message that are part of the applicable BSSAP subset - as defined in 3GPP TS 49.008 [7] – may be sent by the target MSC on the E-interface;\nf)\tduring a subsequent inter-system inter-MSC handover back to 3G_MSC-A or to a third MSC-B', 3G_MSC-B may initiate either an Iu-Release-Request procedure or an A-Clear-Request procedure on the E-interface.

Upon receipt of the Iu-RELOCATION-REQUIRED from RNS-A, 3G_MSC‑A shall send a MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request to MSC‑B including a complete A-HO-REQUEST message.\nNOTE:\t3G_MSC‑A shall not send further MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER requests while a MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response is pending or before any timeouts.\nThe MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request shall carry in the A‑HO-REQUEST all information needed by MSC‑B for allocating a radio channel, see 3GPP TS 08.08. For compatibility reasons, the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request will also identify the cell to which the call is to be handed over. For speech calls, 3G_MSC-A shall also include the Iu Supported Codecs List to be used by MSC-B for subsequent intra-MSC-B intersystem handover to UMTS and intra-MSC-B SRNS relocation.\nIf 3G_MSC-A supports A interface over IP, then for speech calls 3G_MSC-A may include the AoIP-Supported Codecs List (Anchor) in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request. If handover to an A over IP capable BSS-B is performed, MSC-B shall include a Codec List (MSC preferred) in the A-HO-REQUEST message to BSS-B. MSC-B may select the codecs for the Codec List (MSC preferred) from the channel type information and the AoIP-Supported Codecs List (Anchor), if this list was provided by 3G_MSC-A in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request. For a detailed description of the handling of these codec lists by 3G_MSC-A and MSC-B see 3GPP TS 23.153 [25]. If the AoIP-Supported Codecs List (Anchor) was not provided or MSC-B does not support the selection of codecs from the AoIP-Supported Codecs List, then MSC-B shall create the Codec List (MSC preferred) using the channel type information received from 3G_MSC-A in the A-HO-REQUEST message included in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request.\nIf 3G_MSC-A supports handover/relocation to a CSG cell, the target cell belongs to the registered PLMN or an equivalent PLMN, and the HLR or the CSS provided CSG subscription data, 3G_MSC-A shall include the CSG subscription data for the registered PLMN and, if available, for the equivalent PLMNs in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request.\nMSC‑B will return the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response after having retrieved a Handover Number from its associated VLR (exchange of the messages MAP-allocate-handover-number request and MAP-send-handover-report request). The Handover Number shall be used for routing the connection of the call from 3G_MSC‑A to MSC‑B. If a traffic channel is available in MSC‑B the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response, sent to 3G_MSC‑A will contain the complete A-HO-REQUEST-ACKNOWLEDGE message received from BSS-B, containing the radio resources definition to be sent by RNS-A to the UE/MS and possible extra BSSMAP information, amended by MSC‑B due to the possible interworking between the BSSMAP protocol carried on the E-interface and the BSSMAP protocol used on the A-interface. If the traffic channel allocation is queued by BSS-B, the A-QUEUING-INDICATION may optionally be sent back to 3G_MSC‑A. The further traffic channel allocation result (A-HO-REQUEST-ACK or A-HO-FAILURE) will be transferred to 3G_MSC‑A using the MAP-PROCESS-ACCESS-SIGNALLING request. If the traffic channel allocation is not possible, the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response containing an A-HO-FAILURE will be sent to 3G_MSC‑A. MSC‑B will do the same if a fault is detected on the identity of the cell where the call has to be handed over. MSC‑B simply reports the events related to the dialogue. It is up to 3G_MSC‑A to decide the action to perform if it receives negative responses or the operation fails due to the expiry of the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER timer.\nIf A interface over IP is supported, then for speech calls via an A over IP capable BSS-B the selection of the speech codec shall be as described in 3GPP TS 48.008 [5], and if no transcoder is inserted in the BSS-B then MSC-B shall insert a transcoder.\nIf 3G_MSC-A provided an AoIP-Supported Codecs List (Anchor) in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request and MSC-B selected the codecs for the Codec List (MSC preferred) from the AoIP-Supported Codecs List (Anchor), MSC‑B may send the AoIP-Selected Codec (Target) and AoIP-Available Codecs List (MAP) to 3G_MSC-A in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response.\nIf BSS-B does not support A interface over IP or 3G_MSC-A did not include the AoIP-Supported Codecs List (Anchor) in the MAP-PREPARE HANDOVER request, then MSC-B shall not include the AoIP-Selected Codec (Target) and AoIP-Available Codecs List (MAP) in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response. Reception of the AoIP-Selected Codec (Target) and AoIP Available Codecs List (MAP) from MSC-B with the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response indicates to 3G_MSC-A that the target access supports A interface over IP.\nIf an error related to the TCAP dialogue or to the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request is returned from MSC‑B, this will be indicated to 3G_MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑A will terminate the handover attempt. 3G_MSC‑A rejects the handover attempt towards RNS-A. The existing connection to the UE/MS shall not be cleared.\nWhen the A-HO-REQUEST-ACKNOWLEDGE has been received, 3G_MSC‑A shall establish a circuit between 3G_MSC‑A and MSC‑B by signalling procedures supported by the network. In figure 18 this is illustrated by the messages IAM (Initial Address Message) and ACM (Address Complete Message) of Signalling System no 7. MSC‑B awaits the capturing of the UE/MS (clause 6.2.1) on the radio path when the ACM is sent and 3G_MSC‑A initiates the UMTS to GSM handover execution when ACM is received (illustrated by the Iu-RELOCATION-COMMAND and described in clause 6.2.1). 3G_MSC‑A removes the transcoder from the path to the other party.\nMSC‑B transfers to 3G_MSC‑A the acknowledgement received from the correct UE/MS (A-HO-DETECT/A-HO-COMPLETE). The A-HO-DETECT, if received, is transferred to 3G_MSC‑A using the MAP-PROCESS-ACCESS-SIGNALLING request. The A-HO-COMPLETE, when received from the correct UE/MS, is included in the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL request and sent back to 3G_MSC‑A. The circuit is through connected in 3G_MSC‑A when the A-HO-DETECT or the A-HO-COMPLETE is received from MSC‑B. The old radio channel is released when the A-HO-COMPLETE message is received from MSC‑B. The sending of the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL request starts the MAP supervision timer for the MAP dialogue between 3G_MSC‑A and MSC‑B. When the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL request including the A-HO-COMPLETE message is received in 3G_MSC‑A, the resources in RNS-A shall be cleared.\nIn order not to conflict with the PSTN/ISDN signalling system(s) used between 3G_MSC‑A and MSC‑B, MSC‑B must generate an answer signal when A-HO-DETECT/COMPLETE is received.\nMSC‑B shall release the Handover Number when the circuit between 3G_MSC‑A and MSC‑B has been established.\nIf the circuit between 3G_MSC‑A and MSC‑B cannot be established, (e.g. an unsuccessful backward message is received instead of ACM), 3G_MSC‑A terminates the inter-3G_MSC UMTS to GSM handover attempt by sending an appropriate MAP message, for example an ABORT.\n3G_MSC‑A shall retain overall call control until the call is cleared by the fixed subscriber or the UE/MS and there is no further call control functions to be performed (e.g. servicing waiting calls, echo cancellers).\nWhen 3G_MSC‑A clears the call to the UE/MS it also clears the call control functions in 3G_MSC‑A and sends the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL response to release the MAP resources in MSC‑B.\n3G_MSC‑A may terminate the procedure at any time by sending an appropriate MAP message to MSC‑B. If establishment of the circuit between 3G_MSC‑A and MSC‑B has been initiated, the circuit must also be cleared.\nThe UMTS to GSM handover will be aborted by 3G_MSC‑A if it detects clearing or interruption of the radio path before the call has been established on MSC‑B.",

The main differences to the procedures described in clause 8.1.1 relate to the establishment of circuits between the network entities and the Handover Number allocation.\nIn the case of basic UMTS to GSM handover, 3G_MSC‑A shall specify to MSC‑B that no Handover Number is required in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request (see 3GPP TS 29.002 [12]). As for the basic UMTS to GSM handover using a circuit connection, the A-HO-REQUEST is transmitted at the same time. Any subsequent Handover Number allocation procedure will not be invoked until the completion of the basic UMTS to GSM handover procedure (see clause: Subsequent Channel Assignment using a circuit connection). MSC‑B shall then perform the radio resources allocation as described in clause 8.1.1. The MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response shall be returned to 3G_MSC‑A including either the response of the radio resources allocation request received from BSS-B (A‑HO-REQUEST-ACKNOWLEDGE/A-HO-FAILURE with possible extra BSSMAP information. These extra information are amended by MSC‑B due to the possible interworking between the BSSMAP protocol carried on the E‑interface and the BSSMAP protocol used on the A-interface) or potentially the A-QUEUING-INDICATION. The basic UMTS to GSM handover procedure will continue as described in clause 8.1.1 except that no circuit connection will be established towards MSC‑B.\nThe relevant case for the basic UMTS to GSM handover without circuit connection is shown in figure 19.

Upon receipt of the A-HO-REQUIRED from BSS-A, MSC‑A shall send a MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request to 3G_MSC‑B including a complete A-HO-REQUEST message.\nNOTE:\tMSC‑A shall not send further MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER requests while a MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response is pending or before any timeouts.\nThe MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request shall carry in the A‑HO-REQUEST all information needed by 3G_MSC‑B for allocating radio resources in RNS-B, see 3GPP TS 48.008 [5].\nThe MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request shall also carry the identity of the target RNS to which the call is to be handed over, see 3GPP TS 29.002 [12].\nIf MSC-A supports inter-system handover to a CSG cell and BSS-A includes a CSG ID for the target cell in the A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message, then MSC-A shall check the CSG membership of the UE for the target cell as described in clause 4.1.1 before generating the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request. If the UE fails the CSG membership check and the target cell is a CSG cell, MSC-A shall send an A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED-REJECT to BSS-A.\nIf MSC-A supports inter-system handover to a CSG cell, the target cell belongs to the registered PLMN or an equivalent PLMN, and the HLR or the CSS provided CSG subscription data, MSC-A shall include the CSG subscription data for the registered PLMN and, if available, for the equivalent PLMNs in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request.\n3G_MSC‑B will return the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response after having retrieved a Handover Number from its associated VLR (exchange of the messages MAP-allocate-handover-number request and MAP-send-handover-report request). The Handover Number shall be used for routing the connection of the call from MSC‑A to 3G_MSC‑B.\nFor speech calls, if 3G_MSC-B supports the selection of codec based on the Iu-Supported Codecs List, 3G_MSC‑B shall select an Iu Selected codec from the Iu Supported Codecs List, generate associated RAB parameters and connect a transcoder. If the Iu Supported Codecs List was not received or 3G_MSC-B does not support the selection of codec based on the Iu-Supported Codecs List, 3G_MSC‑B shall select the appropriate default speech codec.\nFor handover to UTRAN Iu mode, 3G_MSC-B shall also generate a NAS Synch Indicator for the Iu-RELOCATION-REQUEST message. If the Iu Supported Codecs List was received by 3G_MSC-B and 3G_MSC-B supports the selection of codec based on the Iu-Supported Codecs List, then the Iu Selected codec shall be indicated in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response, sent from 3G_MSC‑B to MSC‑A.\nIf A over IP is supported by MSC-A, then for speech calls MSC-A may include the AoIP-Supported Codecs List (Anchor) in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request to be used by 3G_MSC-B for subsequent intra-MSC-B intersystem handover to A over IP capable BSC. For a detailed description of the handling of this codec list by MSC‑A and 3G_MSC-B see 3GPP TS 23.153 [25].\nIf radio resources are available in RNS-B the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response will contain the complete A-HO-REQUEST-ACK message generated from the Iu-RELOCATION-REQUEST-ACK received from RNS-B, containing the radio resources definition to be sent by BSS-A to the UE/MS. If the radio resource allocation is not possible, the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response containing an A-HO-FAILURE will be sent to MSC‑A. 3G_MSC‑B will do the same if a fault is detected on the identity of the cell where the call has to be handed over. 3G_MSC‑B simply reports the events related to the dialogue. It is up to MSC‑A to decide the action to perform if it receives negative responses or the operation fails due to the expiry of the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER timer.\nIf an error related to the TCAP dialogue or to the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request is returned from 3G_MSC‑B, this will be indicated to MSC‑A and MSC‑A will terminate the handover attempt. MSC‑A shall reject the handover attempt towards BSS-A. The existing connection to the UE/MS shall not be cleared.\nWhen the A-HO-REQUEST-ACK has been received, MSC‑A shall establish a circuit between MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B by signalling procedures supported by the network. In figure 24 this is illustrated by the messages IAM (Initial Address Message) and ACM (Address Complete Message) of Signalling System no 7. 3G_MSC‑B awaits the capturing of the UE/MS (clause 6.2.2) on the radio path when the ACM is sent and MSC‑A initiates the handover execution when ACM is received (illustrated by the A-HO-COMMAND and described in clause 6.2.2).\nIf the BSS-A was connected via an A interface over IP and no transcoding performed in the BSS then MSC-A shall remove the transcoder between the MSC and the other party.\n3G_MSC‑B transfers to MSC‑A the acknowledgement received from the correct UE/MS (A-HO-DETECT/A-HO-COMPLETE). The Iu-RELOCATION-DETECT, if received, is converted to A-HO-DETECT and transferred to MSC‑A using the MAP-PROCESS-ACCESS-SIGNALLING request. The Iu-RELOCATION-COMPLETE, when received from the correct UE/MS, is converted to A-HO-COMPLETE and included in the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL request and sent back to MSC‑A. The circuit is through-connected in MSC‑A when the A-HO-DETECT or the A‑HO‑COMPLETE is received from 3G_MSC‑B. The old radio channel is released when the A-HO-COMPLETE message is received from 3G_MSC‑B. The sending of the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL request starts the MAP supervision timer for the MAP dialogue between MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B. When the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL request including the A-HO-COMPLETE message is received in MSC‑A the resources in BSS-A shall be cleared.\nIn order not to conflict with the PSTN/ISDN signalling system(s) used between MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B, 3G_MSC‑B must generate an answer signal when Iu-RELOCATION-DETECT/COMPLETE is received.\n3G_MSC‑B shall release the Handover Number when the circuit between MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B has been established.\nIf the circuit between MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B cannot be established (e.g. an unsuccessful backward message is received instead of ACM). MSC‑A terminates the inter3G_MSC handover attempt by sending an appropriate MAP message, for example an ABORT.\nMSC‑A shall retain overall call control until the call is cleared by the fixed subscriber or the UE/MS and there is no further call control functions to be performed (e.g. servicing waiting calls, echo cancellers).\nWhen MSC‑A clears the call to the UE/MS it also clears the call control functions in MSC‑A and sends the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL response to release the MAP resources in 3G_MSC‑B.\nMSC‑A may terminate the procedure at any time by sending an appropriate MAP message to 3G_MSC‑B. If establishment of the circuit between MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B has been initiated, the circuit must also be cleared.\nThe GSM to UMTS handover will be aborted by MSC‑A if it detects clearing or interruption of the radio path before the call has been established on 3G_MSC‑B.",

As for the basic GSM to UMTS handover using a circuit connection, the A-HO-REQUEST is transmitted at the same time. Any subsequent Handover Number allocation procedure will not be invoked until the completion of the basic GSM to UMTS handover procedure (see clause: Subsequent Channel Assignment using a circuit connection). 3G_MSC‑B shall then perform the radio resources allocation as described in clause 8.2.1.

(NOTE: MSC‑B shall not send further MAP-PREPARE-SUBSEQUENT-HANDOVER requests while a handover attempt is pending or before any timeouts). Since 3G_MSC‑A is the call controlling MSC, this MSC needs no Handover Number for routing purposes; 3G_MSC‑A can immediately initiate the search for free radio resources. 3G_MSC‑A then inserts a transcoder between it's RNS and the connection to the other party.\nWhen radio resources can be assigned, 3G_MSC‑A shall return in the MAP-PREPARE-SUBSEQUENT-HANDOVER response the complete A-HO-REQUEST-ACK message generated from the Iu-RELOCATION-REQUEST-ACK received from the RNS-B and possible extra BSSMAP information, amended by 3G_MSC‑A due to the possible interworking between the BSSMAP protocol carried on the E-interface and the RANAP protocol used on the Iu-interface. If radio resources cannot be assigned or if a fault is detected on the target cell identity, or the target cell identity in the A-HO-REQUEST is not consistent with the target MSC number, the MAP-PREPARE-SUBSEQUENT-HANDOVER response containing an A-HO-FAILURE message shall be given to MSC‑B, in addition MSC‑B shall maintain the connection with the UE/MS.\nIf the procedure in 3G_MSC‑A is successful then MSC‑B can request the UE/MS to retune to the new RNS-B on 3G_MSC‑A. This is illustrated in figure 26 by the A-HO-COMMAND message. The operation is successfully completed when 3G_MSC‑A receives the Iu-RELOCATION-COMPLETE message.\nAfter GSM to UMTS handover 3G_MSC‑A shall release the circuit to MSC‑B.\n3G_MSC‑A must also terminate the MAP procedure for the basic handover between 3G_MSC‑A and MSC‑B by sending an appropriate MAP message.

The MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request shall carry in the IU-RELOC-REQUEST all information needed by 3G_MSC‑B for allocating radio resources in the case of SRNS relocation without Iur interface, see 3GPP TS 25.413 [11].\nFor speech calls, 3G_MSC-A shall include the Iu Currently used codec and the Iu Supported Codecs List in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request. 3G_MSC‑A shall configure the RANAP RAB parameters according to the appropriate default speech codec. For a relocation to UTRAN Iu mode, if this codec is different from the Iu Currently used codec, 3G_MSC‑A shall also include the NAS Synch Indicator for the default speech codec in the Iu-RELOCATION-REQUEST.\nAlternatively, if 3G_MSC-B is known to support the use of the Iu Supported Codecs List, 3G_MSC-A may configure the RANAP RAB parameters according to the preferred codec and indicate this to 3G_MSC-B by including the RAB configuration indicator in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request. For a relocation to UTRAN Iu mode, if the preferred codec is different from the Iu Currently used codec, 3G_MSC‑A shall also include the NAS Synch Indicator for the preferred codec in the Iu-RELOCATION-REQUEST. The decision to use this option is based on internal configuration information in 3G_MSC-A.\nMAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request shall also carry the identity of the target RNS to which the call is to be relocated, see 3GPP TS 29.002 [12].\nIf 3G_MSC-A supports SRNS Relocation to a CSG cell and RNS-A includes a CSG ID for the target cell in the IU-RELOCATION-REQUIRED message, then 3G_MSC-A shall check the CSG membership of the UE for the target cell as described in clause 4.3.1 before generating the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request. If the UE fails the CSG membership check and the target cell is a CSG cell, 3G_MSC-A shall send an IU-RELOCATION-PREPARATION-FAILURE to RNS-A.\nIf 3G_MSC-A supports SRNS Relocation to a CSG cell, the target cell belongs to the registered PLMN or an equivalent PLMN, and the HLR or the CSS provided CSG subscription data, 3G_MSC-A shall include the CSG subscription data for the registered PLMN and, if available, for the equivalent PLMNs in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request.\n3G_MSC‑B will return the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response after having retrieved one or several Handover Numbers from its associated VLR (exchange of the messages MAP-allocate-handover-number request and MAP-send-handover-report request). The Handover Numbers shall be used for routing the connections of the calls from 3G_MSC‑A to 3G_MSC‑B.\nIf A over IP is supported by 3G_MSC-A, then for speech calls 3G_MSC-A may include the AoIP-Supported Codecs List (Anchor) in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request to be used by 3G_MSC-B for subsequent intra-3G_MSC-B intersystem handover to an A over IP capable BSS. For a detailed description of the handling of this codec list by 3G_MSC-A and 3G_MSC-B see 3GPP TS 23.153 [25].\nFor speech calls, if 3G_MSC-B supports the selection of codec based on the Iu-Supported Codecs List, 3G_MSC‑B shall select an Iu Selected codec from the Iu Supported Codecs List and connect a transcoder. If the Iu Supported Codecs List was not received or 3G_MSC-B does not support the selection of codec based on the Iu-Supported Codecs List, 3G_MSC‑B shall select the appropriate default speech codec.\n3G_MSC-B shall reconfigure the RANAP RAB parameters according to the Iu Selected codec:\n-\tif the RAB configuration indicator is included in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request and the codec selected by 3G_MSC-B is different from the preferred codec; or\n-\tif the RAB configuration indicator is not included in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request and the codec selected by 3G_MSC-B is different from the appropriate default speech codec.\nAdditionally, for a relocation to UTRAN Iu mode, if the Iu Selected codec is different from the Iu Currently used codec, 3G_MSC-B shall include the NAS Synch Indicator for the Iu Selected codec in the Iu-RELOCATION-REQUEST. If the Iu Supported Codecs List was received by 3G_MSC-B and 3G_MSC-B supports the selection of codec based on the Iu-Supported Codecs List, then the Iu Selected codec shall be indicated in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response, sent from 3G_MSC‑B to 3G_MSC‑A.\nIf radio resources are available in 3G_MSC‑B, the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response will contain the complete IU-RELOC-REQUEST-ACKNOWLEDGE message received from RNS-B, containing the radio resources definition to be sent by RNS-A to the UE (in case of relocation without Iur interface) and possible extra RANAP information, amended by 3G_MSC‑B due to the possible interworking between the RANAP protocol carried on the E-interface and the RANAP protocol used on the Iu-interface. If the radio resource allocation is not possible, the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response containing an IU-RELOCATION-FAILURE will be sent to 3G_MSC‑A. 3G_MSC‑B will do the same if a fault is detected on the identity of the RNS where the call has to be relocated. 3G_MSC‑B simply reports the events related to the dialogue. It is up to 3G_MSC‑A to decide the action to perform if it receives negative responses or the operation fails due to the expiry of the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER timer.\nIf an error related to the TCAP dialogue or to the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request is returned from 3G_MSC‑B, this will be indicated to 3G_MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑A will terminate the relocation attempt. The existing connection to the UE shall not be cleared.\nWhen the IU-RELOC-REQUEST-ACKNOWLEDGE has been received, 3G_MSC‑A shall establish a circuit between 3G_MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B by signalling procedures supported by the network. In figure 30 this is illustrated by the messages IAM (Initial Address Message) and ACM (Address Complete Message) of Signalling System no 7. 3G_MSC‑B awaits the capturing of the UE (clause 6.2.3) on the radio path when the ACM is sent and 3G_MSC‑A initiates the relocation execution when ACM is received (illustrated by the IU-RELOC-COMMAND and described in clause 6.2.3). 3G_MSC‑A shall remove the transcoder between the MSC and other party.\n3G_MSC‑B transfers to 3G_MSC‑A the acknowledgement received from the correct UE (IU-RELOC-DETECT/IU-RELOC-COMPLETE). The IU-RELOC-DETECT, if received, is transferred to 3G_MSC‑A using the MAP-PROCESS-ACCESS-SIGNALLING request. The IU-RELOC-COMPLETE, when received from the correct UE, is included in the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL request and sent back to 3G_MSC‑A. The circuit is through connected in 3G_MSC‑A when the IU-RELOC-DETECT or the IU-RELOC-COMPLETE is received from 3G_MSC‑B. The old radio resources are released when the IU-RELOC-COMPLETE message is received from 3G_MSC‑B. The sending of the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL request starts the MAP supervision timer for the MAP dialogue between 3G_MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B. When the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL request including the IU-RELOC-COMPLETE message is received in 3G_MSC‑A, the resources in RNS-A shall be released.\nIn order not to conflict with the PSTN/ISDN signalling system(s) used between 3G_MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B, 3G_MSC‑B must generate an answer signal when IU-RELOC-DETECT/COMPLETE is received.\n3G_MSC‑B shall release the Handover Number when the circuit between 3G_MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B has been established.\nIf the circuit between 3G_MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B cannot be established, (e.g. an unsuccessful backward message is received instead of ACM) 3G_MSC‑A terminates the inter-3G_MSC relocation attempt by sending an appropriate MAP message, for example an ABORT.\n3G_MSC‑A shall retain overall call control until the call is cleared by the fixed subscriber or the UE and there is no further call control functions to be performed (e.g. servicing waiting calls, echo cancellers).\nWhen 3G_MSC‑A clears the call to the UE it also clears the call control functions in 3G_MSC‑A and sends the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL response to release the MAP resources in 3G_MSC‑B.\n3G_MSC‑A may terminate the procedure at any time by sending an appropriate MAP message to 3G_MSC‑B. If establishment of the circuit between 3G_MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B has been initiated, the circuit must also be cleared.\nThe relocation will be aborted by 3G_MSC‑A if it detects release or interruption of the radio path before the call has been established on 3G_MSC‑B.",

The main differences to the procedures described in clause 8.3.1 relate to the establishment of circuits between the network entities and the Handover Number allocation.\nIn the case of basic relocation, 3G_MSC‑A shall specify to 3G_MSC‑B that no Handover Number is required in the MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request (see 3GPP TS 29.002 [12]). As for the basic relocation using a circuit connection, the IU-RELOC-REQUEST is transmitted at the same time together with the identity of the target RNS to which the call is to be relocated. Any subsequent Handover Number allocation procedure will not be invoked until the completion of the basic relocation procedure (see clause: Subsequent Channel Assignment using a circuit connection). 3G_MSC‑B shall then perform the radio resources allocation as described in clause 8.3.1 if applicable.

For a detailed description of the handling of this codec list by 3G_MSC-A and 3G_MSC-B' see 3GPP TS 23.153 [25].\nWhen 3G_MSC‑A receives the ACM from 3G_MSC‑B', 3G_MSC‑A informs 3G_MSC‑B that 3G_MSC‑B' has successfully allocated the radio resources on RNS-B' side by sending the MAP-PREPARE-SUBSEQUENT-HANDOVER response containing the complete IU-RELOC-REQUEST-ACKNOWLEDGE received from RNS-B' and possible extra RANAP information, amended by 3G_MSC‑A due to the possible interworking between the RANAP protocol carried on the E-interface between 3G_MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B' and the RANAP protocol carried on the E‑interface between 3G_MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B. Now 3G_MSC‑B can start the procedure on the radio path if needed.\nFor 3G_MSC‑A the relocation is completed when it has received the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL REQUEST from 3G_MSC‑B'containing the IU-RELOC-COMPLETE received from the RNS-B'. The circuit between 3G_MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B is released. 3G_MSC‑A also sends the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL response to 3G_MSC‑B in order to terminate the original MAP dialogue between 3G_MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B. 3G_MSC‑B releases the radio resources when it receives this message.\nIf no radio resource can be allocated by 3G_MSC‑B' or no circuit between 3G_MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B' can be established or a fault is detected on the target RNS identity or the target RNS identity in the IU-RELOC-REQUEST is not consistent with the target 3G_MSC number, 3G_MSC‑A informs 3G_MSC‑B by using the IU-RELOC-FAILURE message included in the MAP-PREPARE-SUBSEQUENT-HANDOVER response. 3G_MSC‑B shall maintain the existing connection with the UE.\nWhen the subsequent relocation is completed, 3G_MSC‑B' is considered as 3G_MSC‑B. Any further inter-3G_MSC relocation is handled as described above for a subsequent relocation.",

For this call control procedure the following applies.\nCall set-up:\n-\tthe connection to MSC‑B is set up by procedures relevant to the signalling system used in the PSTN/ISDN to which MSC‑A is connected. The call is set up by using the MS Handover Number received from MSC‑B as part of the MAP procedure;\n-\tthe call set-up direction will always be from MSC‑A to MSC‑B, even when the call was originally established by the MS. Functional unit 2 (see figure 2) should therefore keep information on call set-up direction in order to be able to interpret correctly any clearing signals (see below);\n-\tthe unit should indicate the address complete condition to functional unit 3 and through-connect without awaiting the answer signal from MSC‑B. This applies also to signalling systems where address complete signals are not supported. In such cases an artificial address complete is established by functional unit 2.\nCall clearing:\n-\tcall clearing consists of two parts: after inter-MSC handover, clearing of the MS-BSS connection and clearing of the inter-MSC connection. If a request to release the call is generated by the network while the MS is re-tuning from one BSS to another BSS, then MSC‑A shall begin clearing the call to the network and queue the call release to the MS until the MS has resumed communication. This includes the case when MSC‑B and/or MSC‑B' are involved;\n-\tthe MAP procedures are used to transfer information between MSC‑B and MSC‑A in order to maintain full call control within MSC‑A. MSC‑A determines, based on information received from MSC‑B, the appropriate signals (according to 3GPP TS 24.008 [10]) to be sent to the MS, and sends this information to MSC‑B;\n-\twhen MSC‑A clears the call to the MS it also clears the call control functions in MSC‑B and sends the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL response to release the MAP resources in MSC‑B. The clearing of the connection is by procedures relevant to the signalling system in the PSTN/ISDN to which MSC‑A is connected;\n-\twhen the Signalling System no 7 ISDN User Part is used, the normal symmetric release procedures apply on both the connection to the fixed network and to MSC‑B;\n-\twhen a signalling system is used without a symmetric release possibility, some notice should be given to the clear-forward and clear-back procedures;\n-\tfor MS terminating calls the following conditions apply on clear-forward and clear-back:\n-\twhen a clear-forward signal is received on interface B' (see figure 1), MSC‑A clears the circuit to MSC‑B by normal clear-forward procedures;\n-\twhen a clear-back signal is received from MSC‑B, MSC‑A starts normal clear-back procedures towards the fixed network (interface B') and sends the clear-forward signal on interface B'' in order to clear the connection with MSC‑B.\nNOTE 1:\tThis case corresponds to a fault situation.\n-\tfor MS originated calls the following applies:\n-\twhen MSC‑A receives a clear-back signal from MSC‑B, this signal must be interpreted as indicating a clear-forward condition. MSC‑A then clears both the connection on interface B' (see figure 1) and to MSC‑B by normal clear-forward procedures.\nNOTE 2:\tThis case corresponds to a fault situation.\n-\twhen MSC‑A receives a clear-back signal on interface B', MSC‑A should distinguish between national and international connections:\n-\tfor international connections where the Q.118 [1] supervision is done in the ISC, MSC‑A sends a clear-forward signal on both interface B' to the fixed network and interface B'' to MSC‑B;\n-\tfor national connections or for international connections where the Q.118 [1] supervision is not done in the ISC, a timer is started according to national practice for clear-back supervision and MSC‑A proceeds as follows:\ni)\tif a clear-back signal is received from MSC‑B, MSC‑A interprets this as indicating a clear-forward condition and proceeds by clearing the connections on interface B' and to MSC‑B by normal clear-forward procedures;\nii)\tif the timer expires, MSC‑A proceeds by normal clear-forward of the connections on interface B' and to MSC‑B.",

The device is connected in its final position (i.e. B' to B''') when a successful procedure indication is received from functional unit 4. MSC‑B is informed that all procedures in MSC‑B can be terminated (illustrated by the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL response). The device returns to the state where B' and B'' are connected if the subsequent handover procedure fails.\nTimers in MSC‑A.\nThe procedures are supervised by timers in order to avoid a deadlock when responses are not received or the procedures fail. The following timers are defined:\nT101:\tthis timer supervises the queuing time for a free channel. If T101 expires, a no channel indication is generated, a retry procedure could be applied as described in clause 6.1. T101 is set by O&M,\nT102:\tthis timer supervises the time for handover completion for handover between BSSs in MSC‑A. T102 is set by O&M,\nT103:\tthis timer supervises the time between issuing an A-HANDOVER-COMMAND from  MSC‑A and receiving a successful procedure indication from MSC‑B. This timer also supervises the time between sending an A-HO-REQUEST-ACKNOWLEDGE to MSC‑B and receiving a successful procedure indication from MSC‑B'. If T103 expires, the handover procedure is terminated. T103 is set by O&M,\nT104:\tthis timer supervises the time between sending of an A-HO-REQUEST-ACKNOWLEDGE to MSC‑B and receiving the A-HANDOVER-COMPLETE from BSS-B on MSC‑A. If the timer expires, the new radio channel is released. T104 is set by O&M.\n9.3A\tBSS Internal Handover with MSC Support control procedures\nThe \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support\" for AoIP is performed by the MSC that is currently serving the connected BSS (in the following just termed \"serving MSC\"), it may be either MSC-A, MSC-B, 3G_MSC-A or 3G_MSC-B.\nThe \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support\" control procedures in serving MSC include:\ni)\tHandover enquiry. This procedure is only part of the MSC-initiated \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support\" described in clause 6.3.3. The MSC initiates the handover enquiry by sending an A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-ENQUIRY message and starting timer T106.\nThe handover enquiry phase is completed when an A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message is received from the BSS with cause code \"response to an INTERNAL HANDOVER ENQUIRY message\". If this message is not received (expiry of timer T106), or the BSS responds with an A‑HANDOVER-FAILURE message, or the BSS sends an A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message with another cause code, then the MSC terminates the MSC-initiated \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support\".\nii)\tInitiation. The initiation condition is given by reception of the A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message. This starts the Internal Handover Preparation phase for the serving MSC; the serving MSC starts timer T105. Calls for which Internal Handover Preparation has been initiated should be handled with priority higher than normal calls. They should have lower priority than emergency calls. During that phase the serving MSC considers the A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-REQUIRED parameters, tries to allocate the necessary resources.\nThe Internal Handover Preparation phase for the serving MSC ends when the serving MSC sends the A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-COMMAND message or an A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-REQUIRED-REJECT message or when timer T105 expires.\nIf the serving MSC can not perform the \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support\", then it shall send an A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-REQUIRED-REJECT Message to the BSS and shall release all potentially allocated resources as if no A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message was received.\nIf timer T105 expires before the serving MSC could send the A-INTERNAL HANDOVER-COMMAND message, then the serving MSC shall consider the Internal Handover Preparation phase as terminated without success and shall release any allocated resources for the Internal Handover such that the status returns as it was prior to receiving the A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-REQUIRED message. No response shall be sent to the BSS after the expiry of timer T105.\nii)\tExecution. Serving MSC controls the \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support\" by sending the A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-COMMAND message. The \"BSS Internal Handover with MSC Support\" is completed when the A-HANDOVER-COMPLETE message is received. If this signal is not received (expiry of timer T102), the radio path and all the connections and resources associated to that call shall be released.\nFor handover devices with three-party capabilities, the handover device is first set up so that all interfaces A', A'' and B' are connected. This is perfomed before the A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-COMMAND message is sent to the BSS. The handover device may be adjusted when the A-HANDOVER-DETECT message is received. The handover device is connected in its final position (i.e. A'' to B') when the A-HANDOVER-COMPLETE message is received.\nTimers in serving MSC for Internal Handover Preparation\nThe procedures are supervised by timers in order to avoid a deadlock when responses are not received or the procedures fail. The following additional timers are defined:\nT105:\tthis timer supervises the Internal Handover Preparation procedure between BSS and serving MSC. T105 is set by O&M in relation to timer \"T25\" (3GPP TS 48.008 [5]). T105 defines the maximum time a serving MSC may take to respond to an \"INTERNAL HANDOVER REQUIRED\" message. Timer \"T25\" (3GPP TS 48.008 [5]) defines the minimum time the BSS will to wait before it can send a new or repeated (INTERNAL) HANDOVER REQUIRED message or an A-HANDOVER FAILURE. T105 shall be configured to be atleast one round trip delay shorter than the time configured for \"T25\" (3GPP TS 48.008 [5]) to minimise the risk of crossing messages.\nT106:\tthis timer supervises the time between sending of an A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-ENQUIRY message to the BSS and receiving an A-INTERNAL-HANDOVER-REQUIRED or A‑HANDOVER-FAILURE message from the BSS. If T106 expires, the handover procedure is terminated. T106 is set by O&M and should be sufficiently long so that no late responses from BSS can be expected after its expiry.",

      "content": "The call control procedures related to handover/relocation in 3G_MSC‑A can be divided into two functional entities:\n-\tthe first entity is the call control procedure as part of the normal interworking between the PSTN/ISDN and the PLMN/UTRAN; for an UE/MS originating call 3G_MSC‑A is the originating exchange, for an UE/MS terminating call 3G_MSC‑A is the destination exchange;\n-\tthe second entity is the call control procedure for the connection between 3G_MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B in case of a handover/relocation from 3G_MSC‑A to 3G_MSC‑B. For this call control procedure the following applies.\nCall set-up:\n-\tthe connection to 3G_MSC‑B is set up by procedures relevant to the signalling system used in the PSTN/ISDN to which 3G_MSC‑A is connected. The call is set up by using the Handover Number received from 3G_MSC‑B as part of the MAP procedure;\n-\tthe call set-up direction will always be from 3G_MSC‑A to 3G_MSC‑B, even when the call was originally established by the UE/MS. Functional unit 2 (see figure 5) should therefore keep information on call set-up direction in order to be able to interpret correctly any clearing signals (see below);\n-\tthe unit should indicate the address complete condition to functional unit 3 and through-connect without awaiting the answer signal from 3G_MSC‑B. This applies also to signalling systems where address complete signals are not supported. In such cases an artificial address complete is established by functional unit 2.\nCall clearing:\n-\tcall clearing consists of two parts: after handover/relocation, clearing of the RNS-UE/MS or BSS-UE/MS connection and clearing of the inter-3G_MSC connection. If a request to release the call is generated by the network while the UE/MS is re-tuning from one RNS/BSS to another RNS/BSS, then 3G_MSC‑A shall begin clearing the call to the network and queue the call release to the UE/MS until the UE/MS has resumed communication. This includes the case when 3G_MSC‑B and/or 3G_MSC‑B' are involved;\n-\tthe MAP procedures are used to transfer information between 3G_MSC‑B and 3G_MSC‑A in order to maintain full call control within 3G_MSC‑A. 3G_MSC‑A determines, based on information received from 3G_MSC‑B, the appropriate signals (according to 3GPP TS 24.008 [10]) to be sent to the UE/MS, and sends this information to 3G_MSC‑B;\n-\twhen 3G_MSC‑A clears the call to the UE/MS it also clears the call control functions in 3G_MSC‑B and sends the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL response to release the MAP resources in 3G_MSC‑B. The clearing of the connection is by procedures relevant to the signalling system in the PSTN/ISDN to which 3G_MSC‑A is connected;\n-\twhen the Signalling System no 7 ISDN User Part is used, the normal symmetric release procedures apply on both the connection to the fixed network and to 3G_MSC‑B;\n-\twhen a signalling system is used without a symmetric release possibility, some notice should be given to the clear-forward and clear-back procedures;\n-\tfor UE/MS terminating calls the following conditions apply on clear-forward and clear-back:\n-\twhen a clear-forward signal is received on interface B' (see figure 4), 3G_MSC‑A clears the circuit to 3G_MSC‑B by normal clear-forward procedures;\n-\twhen a clear-back signal is received from 3G_MSC‑B, 3G_MSC‑A starts normal clear-back procedures towards the fixed network (interface B') and sends the clear-forward signal on interface B'' in order to clear the connection with 3G_MSC‑B.\nNOTE 1:\tThis case corresponds to a fault situation.\n-\tfor UE/MS originated calls the following applies:\n-\twhen 3G_MSC‑A receives a clear-back signal from 3G_MSC‑B, this signal must be interpreted as indicating a clear-forward condition. 3G_MSC‑A then clears both the connection on interface B' (see figure 4) and to 3G_MSC‑B by normal clear-forward procedures;\nNOTE 2:\tThis case corresponds to a fault situation.\n-\twhen 3G_MSC‑A receives a clear-back signal on interface B', 3G_MSC‑A should distinguish between national and international connections:\n-\tfor international connections where the Q.118 [1] supervision is done in the ISC, 3G_MSC‑A sends a clear-forward signal on both interface B' to the fixed network and interface B'' to 3G_MSC‑B;\n-\tfor national connections or for international connections where the Q.118 [1] supervision is not done in the ISC, a timer is started according to national practice for clear-back supervision and MSC‑A proceeds as follows:\ni)\tif a clear-back signal is received from 3G_MSC‑B, 3G_MSC‑A interprets this as indicating a clear-forward condition and proceeds by clearing the connections on interface B' and to 3G_MSC‑B by normal clear-forward procedures;\nii)\tif the timer expires, 3G_MSC‑A proceeds by normal clear-forward of the connections on interface B' and to 3G_MSC‑B.",

For these procedures the following apply:\nCall set-up:\n-\tthe connection is set up by 3G_MSC‑A. 3G_MSC‑B should provide, if possible, the following backward signals:\n-\tsignals indicating unsuccessful call set-up and, if possible, the cause of call failure;\n-\taddress complete signal;\n-\tanswer signal (see note).\nNOTE:\tThe answer signal is not related to answering by the UE/MS and it has no meaning in the 3G_MSC handover/relocation procedure between 3G_MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B. But after successful handover/relocation or successful subsequent channel assignment using a circuit connection between 3G_MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B this signal is needed for bringing the connection in the answered state in the intermediate PSTN/ISDN exchanges.\n-\tthere will be no indication that the call applies to a 3G_MSC handover/relocation. This information has to be derived from the UE/MS Handover Number received during call set-up in relation to the earlier MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER request/MAP-PREPARE-HANDOVER response procedure between 3G_MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B.\nCall clearing:\n-\tcall clearing consists of two parts after inter-3G_MSC handover/relocation: clearing of the RNS-UE/MS or the BSS-UE/MS connection and clearing of the inter-3G_MSC connection, these cases are only applicable to calls successfully handed over or relocated. If a request to release the call is generated by the network while the UE/MS is re-tuning from one RNS/BSS to another RNS/BSS, then 3G_MSC‑B shall begin clearing the call to the network and queue the call release to the UE/MS until the UE/MS has resumed communication;\n-\tthe MAP is used to transfer information between 3G_MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B in order to make it possible for 3G_MSC‑B to send the appropriate signals to the UE/MS, specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [10], and still leave the call control to 3G_MSC‑A. 3G_MSC‑A normally initiates release of the connection between 3G_MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B. Exceptionally 3G_MSC‑B is allowed to release the connection if no MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL response is received, or if the 3G_MSC Handover/Relocation is to be aborted;\n-\twhen the Signalling System no 7 ISDN User Part is used, the normal symmetric release procedures apply. When a signalling system is used without a symmetric release possibility or a fault condition occurs, the following may apply:\n-\twhen 3G_MSC‑B receives a clear-forward signal from 3G_MSC‑A, it shall release the radio resources;\n-\tin fault situation e.g. machine malfunction or loss of the connection on interface Iu or interface A, 3G_MSC‑B may send a clear-back signal to 3G_MSC‑A.",

To easily distinguish the interface concerned the messages received or sent from this unit are prefixed with either 'MAP' for a MAP message, 'A' for an A‑Interface message, 'Iu' for an Iu-Interface message or 'I' for an ISDN/PSTN message. The procedure in functional unit 3 include:\ni)\tinter 3G_MSC handover/relocation from 3G_MSC‑A;\nThis case is initiated by 3G_MSC‑A, and includes allocation and establishment of the new radio resources. The procedure is outlined in clauses 8.1.1 and 8.1.2. for UMTS to GSM handover, clauses 8.2.1 and 8.2.2 for GSM to UMTS handover and clauses 8.3.1 and 8.3.2 for relocation.\nii)\tintra-3G_MSC UMTS to GSM handovers within the area controlled by 3G_MSC‑B;\nThis procedure is the same as that of ii) in clause 11.3, except that the Iu-RELOCATION-REQUIRED is received by 3G_MSC‑B. After successful completion of the intra-3G_MSC handover, 3G_MSC-B shall notify 3G_MSC-A by sending an A-HANDOVER-PERFORMED message.\niii)\tintra-3G_MSC GSM to UMTS handovers within the area controlled by 3G_MSC‑B;\nThis procedure is the same as that of ii) in clause 11.3, except that the A-HANDOVER-REQUIRED is received by 3G_MSC‑B. After successful completion of the intra-3G_MSC handover, 3G_MSC-B shall notify 3G_MSC-A by sending an A-HANDOVER-PERFORMED message.\niv)\tintra-3G_MSC SRNS Relocation within the area controlled by 3G_MSC‑B;\nThis procedure is the same as that of ii) in clause 11.3, except that the Iu-RELOCATION-REQUIRED is received by 3G_MSC‑B. After successful completion of the intra-3G_MSC SRNS relocation, if security algorithms have been changed, 3G_MSC-B shall notify 3G_MSC-A by sending an A-HANDOVER-PERFORMED or an Iu-LOCATION-REPORT message, depending on the access network protocol used encapsulated on the E-interface (see clauses 4.4.1 and 6.2.3).\nv)\tsubsequent handover/relocation to another 3G_MSC (3G_MSC‑A or 3G_MSC‑B');\nThe initiation procedure is essentially the same as that of i) of clause 11.3. The Handover Command to the BSS or the Relocation Command to the RNS is now generated by 3G_MSC‑B after the A-HO-REQUEST-ACKNOWLEDGE or Iu-RELOCATION-REQUEST-ACKNOWLEDGE is received from 3G_MSC‑A (via functional unit 4). The procedure is terminated in 3G_MSC‑B when 3G_MSC‑B receives a terminate procedure indication from functional unit 4.\nNOTE:\tThe procedures iii), iv) and, in case of a subsequent handover back to 3G_MSC-A, the procedure v) may be applied also in case of a handover/relocation to an RNC which is controlled by 3G_MSC-B or 3G_MSC-A respectively by using the \"Flexible Iu interface for handover/relocation\" option.\nTimers in 3G_MSC‑B.\nThe following procedures are supervised by timers in order to avoid a deadlock when responses are not received or the procedures fail.\nThe following timers are defined for UMTS to GSM handover:\nT401:\tthis timer supervises the queuing time for a free channel. T401 is set by O&M;\nT402:\tthis timer supervises the time for handover completion for UMTS to GSM handover from RNS to BSS in 3G_MSC‑B. If T402 expires, the radio path and the connection on interface B' are released. T402 is set by O&M;\nT404:\tthis timer supervises the time between sending of address complete message to 3G_MSC‑A and receiving the A-HANDOVER-COMPLETE from BSS-B on 3G_MSC‑B. This timer also supervises the time between issuing the handover command to the UE/MS and receiving the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL response from 3G_MSC‑A, for a subsequent handover from UMTS to GSM. In the case of a UMTS to GSM handover without circuit connection between 3G_MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B this timer supervises the time between issuing the A-HO-REQUEST-ACKNOWLEDGE to the 3G_MSC‑A and receiving the A-HANDOVER-COMPLETE from BSS-B on 3G_MSC‑B. If the timer expires, then any new radio channel is released. T404 is set by O&M;\nT410:\tthis timer is used to supervise the time for establishing a circuit connection from 3G_MSC‑A to 3G_MSC‑B. When T410 expires, the allocated channel in 3G_MSC‑B is released. T410 is set by O&M. This timer is not started when 3G_MSC‑A explicitly indicates that no handover number is needed;\nT411:\tthis timer is used to control the time between requesting a subsequent UMTS to GSM handover (A‑HO‑REQUEST to the 3G_MSC‑A) and receiving the response from 3G_MSC‑A (A-HO-REQUEST-ACKNOWLEDGE/A-HO-FAILURE). If T411 expires, the existing connection with the UE/MS is maintained. T411 is set by O&M.\nThe following timers are defined for GSM to UMTS handover:\nT601:\tthis timer supervises the queuing time for a free radio resource. T601 is set by O&M;\nT602:\tthis timer supervises the time for handover completion for GSM to UMTS handover from BSS to RNS in 3G_MSC‑B. If T602 expires, the radio path and the connection on interface B' are released. T602 is set by O&M;\nT604:\tthis timer supervises the time between sending of address complete message to 3G_MSC‑A and receiving the Iu-RELOCATION-COMPLETE from RNS-B on 3G_MSC‑B. This timer also supervises the time between issuing the handover command to the UE/MS and receiving the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL response from 3G_MSC‑A, for a subsequent handover from GSM to UMTS. In the case of a GSM to UMTS handover without circuit connection between 3G_MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B this timer supervises the time between issuing the A-HO-REQUEST-ACKNOWLEDGE to the 3G_MSC‑A and receiving the Iu-RELOCATION-COMPLETE from RNS-B on 3G_MSC‑B. If the timer expires, then any new radio resource is released. T604 is set by O&M;\nT610:\tthis timer is used to supervise the time for establishing a circuit connection from 3G_MSC‑A to 3G_MSC‑B.

This timer is not started when 3G_MSC‑A explicitly indicates that no handover number is needed;\nT611:\tthis timer is used to control the time between requesting a subsequent GSM to UMTS handover (A‑HO‑REQUEST to the 3G_MSC‑A) and receiving the response from 3G_MSC‑A (A-HO-REQUEST-ACKNOWLEDGE/A-HO-FAILURE). If T611 expires, the existing connection with the UE/MS is maintained. T611 is set by O&M.\nThe following timers are defined for SRNS Relocation:\nT801:\tthis timer supervises the queuing time for a free radio resource. T801 is set by O&M;\nT802:\tthis timer supervises the time for relocation completion for relocation between RNSs in 3G_MSC‑B. If T802 expires, the radio path and the connection on interface B' are released. T802 is set by O&M;\nT804:\tthis timer supervises the time between sending of address complete message to 3G_MSC‑A and receiving the Iu-RELOCATION-COMPLETE from RNS-B on 3G_MSC‑B. This timer also supervises the time between issuing the handover command to the UE and receiving the MAP-SEND-END-SIGNAL response from 3G_MSC‑A, for a subsequent relocation. In the case of a relocation without circuit connection between 3G_MSC‑A and 3G_MSC‑B this timer supervises the time between issuing the Iu‑RELOCATION-REQUEST-ACKNOWLEDGE to the 3G_MSC‑A and receiving the Iu‑RELOCATION-COMPLETE from RNS-B on 3G_MSC‑B. If the timer expires, then any new radio resource is released. T804 is set by O&M;\nT810:\tthis timer is used to supervise the time for establishing a circuit connection from 3G_MSC‑A to 3G_MSC‑B. When T810 expires, the allocated channel in 3G_MSC‑B is released. T810 is set by O&M.
