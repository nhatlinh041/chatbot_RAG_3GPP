      "content": "The PMIPv6 PDN Connection Creation procedure is initiated by the node acting as a MAG to create a new PDN connection with the node acting as an LMA for an UE that either attaches for the first time to the EPC, or connects to an additional PDN. The procedure starts with the MAG sending a PBU including the APN to the LMA to register with the LMA a binding for the UE's PDN connection. If multiple PDN connections to the same APN function is supported by the MAG, a PDN connection ID shall also be included in the same PBU message. The LMA confirms establishment of the binding by sending a PBA to the MAG. If multiple PDN connections to the same APN function is supported by the LMA, the received PDN connection ID shall also be included in the same PBA message. Establishment of the binding achieves the following:\n-\tPDN selection: The LMA select the PDN based on the APN contained in the PBU.\n-\tIPv6 Home Network Prefix assignment: The LMA assigns to the UE's PDN connection an IPv6 Home Network Prefix valid in the selected PDN.\n-\tIPv4 Home Address assignment: The LMA assigns to the UE's PDN connection an IPv4 Home Address valid in the selected PDN.\n-\tDownlink and Uplink GRE Key Assignment: The MAG and LMA will establish downlink and uplink GRE keys to be used for GRE encapsulation of the PDN connection's downlink and uplink traffic, respectively.\n-\tGRE Tunnel Establishment: A GRE tunnel is established between the MAG and LMA with the assigned GRE keys to carry uplink and downlink traffic that the UE respectively sends and receives on the PDN connection.\n-\tBCE Creation: The LMA creates a BCE for the PDN connection.\n-\tBULE Creation: The MAG creates a BULE for the PDN connection.\n-\tMAG Link Local Address assignment: The LMA assigns the MAG link local address.\n-\tUE Interface Identifier (IID) assignment: The LMA assigns to the UE an IPv6 Interface Identifier to allow formation of an UE Link Local Address from the well-known link local address prefix (fe80::/64).\n-\tPDN connection ID: The PDN connection ID is provided by the MAG and accepted by LMA, if multiple PDN connections to the same APN function is supported by both MAG and LMA.\n-\tLMA Control Plane Address: the LMA may assign an alternate LMAA or IPv4-LMAA, if this option is supported by both MAG and LMA.\n-\tLMA User Plane Address: the LMA may assign an alternate LMA address for user plane, if this option is supported by both MAG and LMA.\nRegarding the usage and support of the protocol number in the pseudo-header see Annex B.",

      "content": "The PMIPv6 PDN Connection Handover procedure is initiated by the node acting as a new MAG for the UE to update an existing PDN connection for an UE that is already attached to the EPC. The procedure starts with the new MAG sending a PBU including the APN to the LMA to update the binding for the UE's PDN connection. If multiple PDN connections to the same APN function is supported by the new MAG, a PDN connection ID shall also be included in the same PBU message. The LMA confirms update of the binding by sending a PBA to the MAG. If multiple PDN connections to the same APN function is supported by the LMA, the received PDN connection ID shall also be included in the same PBA message. Update of the binding achieves the following:\n-\tIPv6 Home Network Prefix re-assignment: The LMA re-assigns to the UE's PDN connection the IPv6 Home Network Prefix valid in the selected PDN.\n-\tIPv4 Home Address re-assignment: The LMA re-assigns to the UE's PDN connection the IPv4 Home Address valid in the selected PDN.\n-\tDownlink and Uplink GRE Key Assignment: The MAG and LMA will establish downlink and uplink GRE keys to be used for GRE encapsulation of downlink and uplink traffic, respectively on the PDN connection.\n-\tGRE Tunnel Establishment: A GRE tunnel is established between the MAG and LMA with the assigned GRE keys to carry uplink and downlink traffic that UE respectively sends and receives on the PDN connection.\n-\tBCE Update: The LMA updates or creates the BCE for the PDN connection.\n-\tBULE Creation: The new MAG creates a BULE for the PDN connection.\n-\tIP address(es) preservation: the IP addresses allocated in the previous initial attachment are reused if IP address(es) preservation decision is made.\n-\tMAG Link Local Address re-assignment: The LMA re-assigns the same MAG link local address.\n-\tUE Interface Identifier (IID) re-assignment: The LMA re-assigns to the UE the same IPv6 Interface Identifier to allow formation of the same UE Link Local Address from the well-known link local address prefix (fe80::/64).\n-\tPDN connection ID: The PDN connection ID is provided by the MAG and accepted by LMA, if multiple PDN connections to the same APN function is supported by both MAG and LMA.\n-\tLMA Control Plane Address: for handover between non-3GPP and 3GPP access, the LMA may assign a possibly different alternate LMAA or IPv4-LMAA if this option is supported by both MAG and LMA. For an intra-3GPP access handover, the LMA shall re-assign the same alternate LMAA or IPv4-LMAA if such an address was allocated during the PDN connection establishment or during a handover between non-3GPP and 3GPP access.\n-\tLMA User Plane Address: for handover between non-3GPP and 3GPP access, the LMA may assign a possibly different alternate LMA address for user plane, if this option is supported by both MAG and LMA. For an intra-3GPP access handover, the LMA shall re-assign the same alternate LMA address for user plane if such an address was allocated during the PDN connection establishment or during a handover between non-3GPP and 3GPP access.\nThe PMIPv6 LMA Initiated Update Notification procedure is then initiated by the LMA to notify the old MAG for handover with SGW relocation as specified in 3GPP TS 23.402 [3], to trigger the generation of End Marker by the MAG as specified in subclause 5.11.",

      "content": "The Mobile Anchor Gateway (MAG) and the Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) establish and maintain a bi-directional tunnel for each PDN connection, which is used for routing the UE's PDN connection user-plane traffic between the MAG and the LMA. This tunnel is based on GRE encapsulation as specified in IETF RFC 2890 [21] (see also IETF RFC 2784 [20]) and is established as a result of exchanging the Proxy Binding Update (PBU) and the Proxy Binding Acknowledgment (PBA) messages between the MAG and LMA. The PBU and PBA messages establish unique Binding Cache Entry (BCE) and Binding Update List Entry (BULE) entries for each PDN connection at the LMA and the MAG respectively. The tunnel end points are:\n-\tthe Proxy-CoA at the MAG and LMAA or LMA User Plane Address (if an alternate address is used for user plane) at the LMA with GRE encapsulation (for IPv6 transport network); or\n-\tthe IPv4-Proxy-CoA at the MAG and IPv4-LMAA or LMA User Plane Address (if an alternate address is used for user plane) at the LMA with GRE encapsulation (for IPv4 transport network), as described in IETF RFC 5845 [7].\nGRE encapsulation shall always be used; the GRE tunneling negotiation described in IETF RFC 5845 [7] is not applicable and the GRE Key Identifier Option shall always be present in the PBU messages for PMIPv6 PDN Connection Creation and binding registration after handover.\nThe LMA may assign an alternate LMAA or IPv4-LMAA during the setup of the PDN connection, if this option is supported by both MAG and LMA.\nTear down of GRE tunnels and cleanup of state is done explicitly by MAG Initiated PDN Connection Deletion or LMA Initiated PDN Connection Deletion; additionally, the tunnel is torn down when the binding lifetime expires as described in IETF RFC 5213 [4].\nA PMIPv6 node (MAG or LMA), which uses the control plane A protocol stack (see subclause 4.2) shall send signalling messages specified in Section 5 with IPv4-UDP encapsulation in IPv4 transport network as specified in IETF RFC 5844 [5].\nA PMIPv6 node (MAG or LMA), which uses the control plane B protocol stack (see subclause 4.2) shall send signalling messages specified in Section 5 natively, without encapsulation in IPv6 transport network as specified in IETF RFC 5213 [4].\nThe maximum size of an inner IP packet that may be transmitted without fragmentation by the PDN GW or the MS/UE is the same as the maximum N-PDU size that can be transmitted without IP fragmentation as defined in 3GPP TS 23.060 [23].\nRecommendations on how to set the default inner MTU size at the PDN GW and UE/MS to avoid IP fragmentation of both inner IP packets (in the PDN GW or UE/MS) and outer IP packets in the backbone are specified in clause 9.3 of 3GPP TS 23.060 [23].\nTo avoid network overload due to excessive signalling, when sending a PBU message, the requested binding lifetime should be sufficiently large, e.g. greater than 300 seconds.

      "content": "The PDN GW shall follow Proxy Mobile IPv6 End Marker notification procedure as specified in subclause 5.7.1 and 5.7.2 of 3GPP TS 23.402 [3]. When sending the Update Notification message, the PDN GW shall follow the LMA procedure specified in subclause 5.11 as follows:\n1.\tThe PDN GW shall set the notification reason to \"VENDOR-SPECIFIC-REASON\" as specified in IETF RFC 7077 [35].\n2.\tThe PDN GW shall include End Marker Notification mobility option.\n3.\tThe PDN GW shall set the Acknowledge (A) flag to \"0\", thereby not requesting an acknowledgement message from the Serving GW.\nAnnex A:\tvoid\nAnnex B (Normative): Definition of the protocol number in pseudo-header\nB.1\tGeneral\nIn this specification PMIP refers to PMIPv6 as defined in IETF RFC5213 [4] and IETF RFC5213 [4] is based on Mobile IPv6 IETF RFC 3775[8]. IETF RFC 3775[38], however, is obsolete by IETF RFC 6275 [8], which specifies protocol number 135 instead of 2 to be used in the checksum pseudo-header. For forward compatibility with future 3GPP releases, the protocol number 135 shall be supported. In addition the protocol number 2 may also be supported.\nNOTE:\tSome nodes complying to an earlier version of this specification can be implemented according to IETF RFC 3775[38] and this could result in the use of different protocol numbers within a network.\nTo migrate a protocol number 2 based PMIP network into a protocol number 135 based PMIP network, the network migration may be achieved by static configuration or supporting a migration solution as specified in this Annex B. Any other alternatives for a specific development use case are possible.\nB.2\tInterworking of different protocol number\nIf a PMIPv6 node (LMA) supports both protocol numbers (2 and 135), it shall silently discard the received PBU message if the checksum value calculated from the protocol number 2 and 135 are both invalid. If one of the protocol number (2 or 135) is valid in checksum calculation, the node shall use this protocol number in the \"pseudo-header\" when sending any subsequent PMIPv6 messages with the same peer PMIPv6 node. If the checksum validation is skipped, the LMA shall use the configured protocol number for the subsequent PMIPv6 messages to that peer node.\nIf a PMIPv6 node (MAG) supports both protocol numbers (2 and 135), it shall construct PBU message using protocol number 135 which takes precedence over protocol number 2. If no response is received from LMA, the MAG sends another PBU message to the peer node using protocol number 2. The MAG shall store the protocol number of the response message and use it for the subsequent message interaction. If the checksum validation is skipped, the MAG shall use the configured protocol number for the subsequent PMIPv6 messages to that peer node.\nAnnex C (informative): Change History\nChange
