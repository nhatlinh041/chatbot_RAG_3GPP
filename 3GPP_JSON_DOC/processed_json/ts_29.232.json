      "content": "The present document describes the protocol to be used on the Media Gateway Controller (MGC) – Media Gateway (MGW) interface. The Media Gateway Controllers covered in this specification are the MSC server and the GMSC server. The basis for this interface profile is the H.248.1 [10] protocol as specified in ITU-T. The usage of this protocol is described in 3GPP TS 23.205 [2] and 3GPP TS 29.205 [7] for BICC circuit switched core network, in 3GPP TS 23.231 [54] and 3GPP TS 29.231 [57] for SIP-I circuit switched core network.\nThis profile includes the support for the enhanced MSC server to provide access to IMS Centralised services as described in 3GPP TS 23.292 [59] and thus the procedures related to this interface are described in 3GPP TS 29.292 [60]. As a result the interworking with SIP and the associated MGW control procedures described in 3GPP TS 29.163[61] for the interworking between BICC/ISUP circuit switched core network and IP Multimedia core network are incorporated.\nThis specification describes the changes to H.248 which are needed to handle 3GPP specific traffic cases. This is done by using the H.248 standard extension mechanism. In addition certain aspects of the base protocol H.248 are not needed for this interface and thus excluded by this profile.",

The profile (name and version) is only returned in the reply if the MGC cannot support the specified profile in the ServiceChangeRequest. The returned reply shall indicate the profile and version supported or \"NoProfile\" if no profile is supported. Upon reception of a profile in the reply, if the MGW supports the indicated profile, it shall issue a new ServiceChange Request with the agreed profile to explicitly confirm the acceptance of the profile to the MGC ; otherwise, if the MGW does not support the indicated profile, it may continue the registration or re-registration procedure by issuing a new ServiceChange Request with an alternative profile ; until such procedure is successfully completed the MGW shall remain out of service. In the instance that the MGW did not indicate a profile in the original ServiceChangeRequest and the MGC returned a profile in the reply, the MGW shall issue a new ServiceChangeRequest with the appropriate profile or \"NoProfile\" if no profile is supported. If the profile is not returned the MGC shall use the capabilities specified by the Profile indicated in the service change request.\nNOTE:\tIt should be observed that the profile registration is not a \"cold calling\" negotiation; the operator shall have configured the network to support certain profiles and so the profile registration within the Mc interface permits network upgrade scenarios but otherwise is simply a means to confirm the connection of the profile to be used over the Mc interface between MGC and  MGW.",

      "content": "The MGC uses this package to indicate to the MGW that the Iu (or Nb) User Plane is used between the RNC (or distant MGW) and the MGW. The package is sent in the Establish bearer, Modify Bearer Characteristics and Prepare bearer procedures. For more information on the User Plane and for a description of ' UP mode of operation', 'UP versions' and 'Delivery of erroneous SDUs' see 3GPP TS 25.415 [4].\nThe following procedures are valid for UP in Support Mode:\n-\tThe MGW shall be able to initiate and respond to the UP control procedures (PDU type 14 frames) independently of the Stream Mode during the call establishment phase, i.e. when not in TrFO.\n-\tOtherwise, during TrFO the MGW shall be able to forward UP control procedures (PDU type 14 frames) received at one termination to the other termination.\n-\tThe UP Initialisation procedure is always acknowledged between MGW peers. If an MGW receives a request for a notification for the bearer establishment then the MGW shall not send the notification until after it has either sent or received the acknowledgement for the UP initialisation.\n-\tThe MGW shall always store RFCI parameters against the MGW termination that received or that sent the UP initialisation.\n-\tIf an MGW has the UP termination property Initialisation Direction = Incoming then it expects to either receive an Initialisation (externally) or after receiving initialisation information internally send an initialisation (externally), based on what occurs first.\n-\tIf an MGW has UP termination property Initialisation Direction = Outgoing and interface CN, then it generates a network originated Initialisation PDU as soon as the bearer towards the succeeding node is successfully established, with RFCIs corresponding to the last codec configured on the termination. If another termination in the same context is initialised with the same codec type and configuration the MGW should re-use the RFCI values for its Initialisation PDU, otherwise it must assign its own values. The initialisation information sent by the MGW depends on the service that the bearer supports. For CSD service see 3GPP TS 29.007 [6] chapter 11.5. For speech service see 3GPP TS 26.102 [26] chapter 8.\n-\tIf an MGW has UP termination property Initialisation Direction = Outgoing and interface RAN, then it expects to receive an Initialisation externally. It shall not pass the initialisation parameters internally. It may initiate RFCI Value Correction out from this termination.\n-\tA CN incoming or outgoing termination having already completed its UP initialisation towards a peer MGW shall not send externally any new UP initialisation except if a reserve / modify characteristic procedure occured on that termination since the last initialisation.\n-\tRAN Outgoing termination may perform, during its lifetime, subsequent RFCI Value corrections, e.g. due to changes of RFCIs on other terminations.\n-\tIf an MGW has two terminations in the same context defined as supporting the UP package and with Initialisation Direction incoming, then when it receives an Initialisation procedure from one side (provided the bearer connection from the other termination to its peer MGW is established) it shall start the UP initialisation procedure towards the peer MGW. The MGW shall perform this procedure independently of the through-connection of the terminations in the context. The MGW shall relay control information from the first initialisation to the UP peer for use at the subsequent initialisation. Also, subsequent control procedures received on one UP shall be relayed to the other UP entity when the two UP entities are connected within the MGW. This behaviour is described in more detail in Annex A. -\tWhen adding a new CN incoming termination to a context that has already a RAN or CN incoming termination, if the existing termination has already completed its UP initialisation, the MGW shall not start an initialisation procedure on the new termination based on the control information already stored at the initialised incoming termination in the context.\n-\tIf an MGW has one termination with properties \"interface = RAN\" and \"initialisation direction = outgoing\" and another termination with property \"initialisation direction = Incoming\" in the same context, then the MGW shall not forward the UP initialisation from the Incoming termination until it has received a UP initialisation at the \"RAN\"/\"outgoing\" side. If the codec type and codec modes configured on both terminations are identical, and if the RFCI values stored at the \"incoming\"  termination do not match the RFCI values stored at the \"outgoing\" RAN side then \"RFCI Value Correction\" may be performed to the \"outgoing\" RAN side: The MGW starts UP initialisation with the RFCI values 'relayed' from the \"Incoming\" side. No \"RFCI Value Correction\" is permitted at an outgoing RAN termination whose Iu initialisation negotiates the version 1 of the support mode, at an \"incoming\" Iu termination or at any Nb termination.\n-\tIf a new RAN outgoing termination is added to a context that has already a RAN incoming or CN incoming termination, and if the existing termination has already completed its UP initialisation, the MGW may carry out a RFCI value correction on the new RAN outgoing termination., The control information to be used for the RFCI value correction shall be relayed from the initialised incoming termination in the context.\n-\tNo RFCI value correction shall be triggered for data call.\n-\tAs an implementation option, \"RFCI Value Correction\" may be delayed if terminations are not through-connected; it will be triggered by connection modification. Otherwise it shall be performed immediately\n-\tIf \"RFCI Value Correction\" is not performed the MGW  shall map the indexes for  frames from one side to the RFCI indexes for frames from the other side. This behaviour is described in more detail in Annex A.\n-\tIf an MGW has two RAN terminations connected to the same context then the \"RFCI Value Correction\" is performed by the Outgoing termination.\n-\tIf an MGW has two terminations which support the UP package connected to the same context and both RFCI sets match then the MGW may pass frames transparently through the UP entities; no monitoring of the frames is performed, provided that the terminations are through-connected. This behaviour is described further in Annex A.\n-\tIf the MGW is passing frames transparently, no UP monitoring is performed. When the MGW receives an H.248 procedure request which requires interpretation or interaction with the UP, then it shall resume its UP protocol responsibilities, i.e. perform monitoring or termination of the UP protocol.\n-\tIf an MGW sends an FP UP initialization message from a termination, the MGW shall only offer versions of the FP UP, which are given in the property \"UP versions\" of this termination and which are supported by the MGW for this termination.\n-\tIf an MGW receives an FP UP initialization message at a termination, the MGW shall only positively acknowledge this initialization message, if versions of the FP UP are offered, which are given in the property \"UP versions\" and which are supported at the MGW for this termination. In the positive FP UP initialization acknowledge message, the MGW shall select one of these versions. If none of these versions are offered in the FP UP initialization message, the MGW shall send a negative FP UP acknowledge message and it shall not forward the initialization to a possible second FP UP termination in the same context.\n-\tIf PCM is used on the Nb then FP UP initialization shall be performed by the termination with property \"Outgoing\". If the termination property is \"Incoming\" then it shall receive the RFCI's from its IuFP peer (or from internal MGW termination with IuFP and same codec). If IuFP is defined on another termination in the MGW but the codec is different, i.e. not TrFO then the relaying of RFCI's shall not be performed. These IuFP peer connection shall be seen as completely separate.\n-\tthe UP initialisation information attached to a termination (RFCI values, codec type and mode(s), UP initialisation completed or not) are kept unchanged when the termination is moved to a new context.\n-\tthe initialisation direction may be changed during the lifetime of a termination ; upon such a change, the MGW shall apply the behaviour attached to the new initialisation direction.\nThe procedures for a termination configured in UP Transparent Mode are those described in 3GPP TS 25.415 [4].",

For more information on the IWF, refer to 3GPP TS 29.007 [6].\nWhen the Media Gateway Controller initiates the \"Establish Bearer\" procedure, the \"Prepare Bearer\" procedure, the \"Modify Bearer Characteristics\" procedure, the \"Reserve Circuit\" procedure, the \"Reserve RTP Connection Point\" procedure, the \"Configure RTP Connection Point\" procedure or the \"Reserve and Configure RTP Connection Point\" procedure, it shall provide the PLMN BC (\"plmnbc\" property above) for the termination on the mobile side and the ISDN BC (standard H.248 properties, clause \"Bearer Capabilities\") for the termination on the fixed side. For a mobile-to-mobile call, it shall provide the PLMN BC on both terminations.\nThe presence of the PLMN BC property may trigger the use of the IWF.\nOnce the bearer has been established, after B-answer, the \"Activate Interworking Function\" procedure is used to activate the IWF. The Activate Protocol signal (\"actprot\") will start the negotiation of the layer 2 protocols on both sides. If a modem or fax service is requested, the signal shall contain the Local Peer Role parameter (\"localpeer\"), to tell the modem whether it should act as originating or terminating peer.\nNOTE:\tThe Activate Protocol signal is needed only after B-answer as described above or after successful in-call modification from speech to fax, to activate the protocol timers at the correct time. This is the only time when this signal is needed (specifically, the signal is not used after a handover sequence or for lawful interception).\nThe IWF Protocol Indication notifications are used by the MGW to inform the MSC server about IWF protocol events. The MSC has to request the detection of the events \"Protocol Negotiation Result\" and \"Rate Change\" in the \"Activate IWF\" procedure, the \"Establish Bearer\" procedure, the \"Prepare Bearer\" procedure, the \"Modify Bearer Characteristics \" procedure, the \"Reserve Circuit\" procedure, the \"Reserve RTP Connection Point\" procedure, the \"Configure RTP Connection Point\" procedure or the \"Reserve and Configure RTP Connection Point\" procedure.\nFor handover to GSM, or change of channel characteristics within the GSM network, the property GSM Channel Coding (\"gsmchancod\"), which contains the information about the channel type and the number of channels, shall be transmitted to the termination on the mobile side in the \"Establish Bearer\", the \"Prepare Bearer\", the \"Reserve Circuit\", the \"Reserve RTP Connection Point\", the \"Configure RTP Connection Point\" and the \"Reserve and Configure RTP Connection Point\" procedures together with the PLMN BC. The presence of the GSM Channel Coding property also indicates that the termination is using a GSM access network.\nIf the MGW has requested a rate change due to GSM fax rate mismatch (CMM procedure see 3GPP TS 43.045 [35]) then it shall suspend transmission until the MSC Server has modified the PLMN Bearer Capability and GSM Channel Coding property to match the required rate. If this occurs while other context manipulations are occurring the MGW shall only resume transmission when the streams are bothway connected and the PLMN Bearer Capability and Channel Coding are correct. The MGW shall not send subsequent rate change notifications while the outstanding rate change has not been performed by the MSC Server.",

This termination could for example be combined in a context with a termination with the txp and ctyp packages for gateway functionality between PSTN text telephony and mobile CTM based text telephony. These packages are described in ITU-T Recommendation H.248.2 [17].\nThe CTM algorithm has states. The states defined in the text termination connection state property are mapped into CTM states in the following way:\n-\tIdle: CTM disabled because of an unsuccessful CTM availability negotiation.\n-\tPrepare: normal initial state with CTM monitoring active.\n-\tConnected: CTM negotiation is completed.\nFor each new call, the CTM termination shall be put in the Prepare state.\nWhen the CTM availability negotiation is completed, the state is Connected.\nThe state transitions are automatic, except for setting Prepare state as described above.",

This allows MGW to collect statistics per interface type associated with the RTP bearer termination as required by 3GPP TS 32.407[58]. The provision of these statistics is outside of the scope of this specification.\nAnnex A (informative):Framing protocol Interworking Function (FPIF)\nA.1\tIntroduction\nSDUs transmitted over an Iu or Nb interface and received at a MGW whose outgoing UP is also Iu or Nb shall be relayed to the outgoing UP MGW termination.  If no interworking function (other than the FPIF) or transcoder device is inserted by the MGW, and if UP terminations are present, then PDUs and control procedures are passed between MGW terminations by the FPIF. The FPIF is the functional entity responsible for aligning or mapping control procedures (including RFCIs, frame numbers etc) on the separate UP interfaces according to the package procedures described in the main text. The FPIF determines if the two UP configurations are identical and thus the UP PDUs may be passed transparently. If the FPIF determines that the two UP configurations are not identical it applies the required mapping. The relaying of PDUs transparently can also be considered as FPIF bypass.\nNOTE:\tthe implementation in the MGW can perform a more efficient processing of the PDUs in this case. The MGW switching and bypassing of the protocol functions during TrFO is left to the manufacturer's implementation.\nUP initialisations are not handled by the FPIF, only receipt of the Subflow combinations and the RFCI allocations are received by the FPIF for each UP.\nThe RFCIs are relayed by the FPIF as described in main text for the UP package procedures.\nFigure A.1: The Framing Protocol Interworking Function\nA.2\tFPIF procedures with respect to Iu framing protocol\nThis clause handles relay of user data indicated to the FPIF in a Nb- or Iu-UP-data-indication message and transmitted between peer UP layer entities in PDU types 0 and 1. The FPIF passes this information to the UP layer on the sending side in a Nb- or Iu-UP-data-request message.\nA.2.1\tPayload\nReceived SDUs shall be forwarded unmodified to the next MGW. Note that if \"delivery of erroneous SDUs\" is set to 'no', faulty SDUs are already discarded by the Iu or Nb support mode functions and, hence, not delivered to the FPIF.\nA.2.2\tRFCIs\nIf the RFCI values on the outgoing UP interface match those initialised on the incoming UP interface then the RFCI indicated by the lower layer (i.e. Iu or Nb) on the receiving side shall be forwarded unmodified to lower layer on the sending side.\nIf the RFCI sets on the outgoing UP interface do not match those initialised on the incoming UP interface then the FPIF performs mapping between the RFCIs on each UP for the same initialised Subflow Combination.\nThe FPIF is the entity that may perform the RFCI value correction procedure as described in the main text, after this procedure then relaying of the received RFCI shall be performed.\nA.2.3\tFQC\nThe FQC indicated by the lower layer (i.e. Iu or Nb) on the receiving side shall be forwarded unmodified to lower layer on the sending side.\nA.2.4\tFrame number\nThe frame number indicated by the lower layer (i.e. Iu or Nb) on the receiving side shall be forwarded unmodified to lower layer on the sending side.\nA discontinuity in framing protocol support mode frame numbers is allowed at the end of the TrFO break.\nA.3\tRelay of status information\nThis clause handles relay of status information indicated to the FPIF in a Nb- or Iu-UP-status-indication message and transmitted between peer UP layer entities in PDU type 14. The FPIF in general passes this information to the UP layer on the sending side.\nA.3.1\tVoid\nA.3.2\tRate Control Frames\nThe FPIF shall pass rate control request and rate control acknowledgement frames transparently between incoming UP interface and outgoing UP interface.\nBefore a MGW reverts from TrFO break operation (for example during handover or relocation where the rate control procedures may have been operating independently between each UP interface) the FPIF may perform rate control procedures to each UP peer. It shall then use the Maximum rate and Current rate settings from the opposite UP configurations. This is performed to align the UP's on each side of the MGW to enable relaying of all subsequent PDUs as described above.\nOptionally, the UP layer protocol entity on the sending side may substitute the frame number received in a status request by another number, but shall then substitute the initial number back in the status indication containing the acknowledgement. Figure A.2 shows an example of the relay of the rate control procedure.\nFigure A.2: Relay of a control procedure\nA.3.2\tTime Alignment\nTime alignment frames shall be relayed unmodified.\nAnnex B (informative):Examples for Usage of the 3GUP Package \"Initialization Direction\" Property\nFigure B.1: 3G to 3G Call (A to B) , originating RAB established after Nb bearer, same codec configuration on originating Iu and Nb bearers\nNOTE:\tThe Initialization Direction property of the Nb termination of MGW A could alternatively be set to 'Outgoing', but different RFCIs may then be initialized on the Iu and Nb bearers.\nFigure B.2: 3G Originating Call, originating RAB established after Nb bearer, same codec configuration on originating Iu and Nb bearers\nNOTE:\tThe Initialization Direction property of the Nb termination of MGW A could alternatively be set to 'Outgoing', but different RFCIs may then be initialized on the Iu and Nb bearers.\nFigure B.3: 3G Terminating Call\nFigure B.4: 3G to 3G Call (A to B), originating RAB established before or in parallel to the Nb bearer or different codec configuration on originating Iu and Nb bearers\nFigure B.5: 3G Originating Call, originating RAB established before or in parallel to the Nb bearer or different codec configuration on originating Iu and Nb bearers\nFigure B.6: 2G to 2G Call (A to B)\nAnnex C (Normative):Profile description\nC.1\tProfile Identification\nProfile name:\nThreegbicsn\nVersion:\n8\nThe name and version of the profile that is sent in the service change command.\nC.2\tSummary\nThis Profile describes the minimum mandatory settings and procedures required to fulfil the requirements of the Mc interface media gateway control. In addition optional settings and procedures are described which fulfil optional features and where supported, the minimum mandatory settings within the optional procedures and packages are identified that must be supported in order to support that feature.\n\"Optional\" or \"O\" means that it is optional for either the sender or the receiver to implement an element. If the receiving entity receives an optional element that it has not implemented it should send an Error Code (e.g. 445\" Unsupported or Unknown Property\", 501\"Not Implemented\", etc.) . \"Mandatory\" or \"M\" means that it is mandatory for the receiver to implement an element. Whether it is mandatory for the sender to implement depends on specific functions; detail of whether elements of the core protocol are manadatory to be sent are defined in the stage 2 procedures, stage 3 procedures and/or the descriptions of individual packages.\nThe setting or modification of elements described in the profile under the heading \"Used in Command\" has the meaning that the property can be set/modified with that command.

See 3GPP TS 25.414 [21] for RNC and for core network see 3GPP TS 29.414 [32]. For IP the IANA ICP IDI format of the NSAP addressing format as specified in X.213 [33] shall be used.  For Ipv4 networks the IPv4 format recommended by X.213 shall be adopted.\nNOTE 5:\tThe value is mapped to/from the first 4(or 16) octets of the IPv4 (or IPv6) address part of the Transport Layer Address in 3GPP TS 25.413 [20].\nNOTE 6:\tThe value is mapped to/from the Binding ID in the RANAP IE Iu transport Association, 3GPP TS 25.413 [20].\nNOTE 7:\tFor the RTP Payload for Redundant Audio Data, the encoding name with \"red\" and \"fmtp\" attributes shall be provided to indicate the redundancy level and shall always be signalled in conjunction with the CLEARMODE Payload type as described in 10.2.3.5.2. No other Payload types are currently defined for use with the Redundant RTP Payload.\nNOTE 8:   For RTP flows, where RTCP resources are reserved together with the RTP resources using the \"RTP Specific Behaviour\" property of the Gate Management package (gm) property, the MGC may also supply additional RTCP bandwidth modifiers (i.e. RR and RS, see IETF RFC 3556 [52]). The AS bandwidth value will include the bandwidth used by RTP. In the absence of the RTCP bandwidth modifiers, the MGW shall allow an additional 5% of the AS bandwidth value for the bandwidth for RTCP, in accordance with IETF RFC 3556 [52].\nAnnex D (informative):Change history\nDate\nTSG #\nTSG Doc.\nCR\nRev\nCat\nSubject/Comment\nNew\nSep 2000\nInitial draft created after N4#4 based on N4-000620\n0.1.0\nOct 2000\nUpdated after N4 R2000 Ad Hoc Stockholm based on N4-00823 and N4-000842\n0.2.0\nNov 2000\nReference for MTP 3B corrected; RFC reference for SCTP added\n0.3.0\nNov 2000\nUpdated according to N4‑000996, N4‑000998, N4‑000999, N4‑001000, N4‑001021, N4‑001028 & N4‑001097 as agreed in CN4 #5\n1.0.0\nNov 2000\nCN#10\nTo TSG-CN Plenary #10 for information\n1.1.0\nJan 2001\nUpdated according to NJ‑010069, NJ‑010030, NJ‑010098, NJ‑010094, NJ‑010033, NJ‑010097, NJ‑010095, NJ‑010112 as agreed in the Joint CN3/CN4 Meeting held during the CN4#6\n1.1.1\nJan 2001\nReferences ordered by specification/recommendation number; references to 3GPP specifications include full titles as shown on the title page; literal reference numbers and references to clauses replaced with fields; all table cells outlined with 0.5pt lines; appropriate 3GPP paragraph styles applied.\n1.2.0\nFeb 2001\nUpdated according to N4‑010245, N4‑010248, N4‑010249, N4‑010303, N4‑010304, N4‑010305, agreed in CN4 Release 4 ad hoc, Madrid.\nReferences to Q.1902.x replaced by references to 29.205; 3GPP styles applied consistently; form for ITU-T recommendations in text is now \"ITU‑T Recommendation A.NNNN\".\n1.3.0\nMar 2001\nUpdated according to N4‑010384, N4‑010401 (part) & N4‑010472, agreed in CN4 in Sophia Antipolis.\nReferences to Q.1950, Q.1970 and Q.1990 replaced by reference to 29.205.
