      "content": "A common functional architecture to support MC services (i.e., MCPTT defined in 3GPP TS 23.379 [16], MCVideo defined in 3GPP TS 23.281 [12], MCData defined in 3GPP TS 23.282 [13]) including common application plane and signalling plane entities is specified in this document. It also deals with the functional architecture of the MC gateway UE to enable access to the MC system from MC clients residing on non-3GPP devices. A subset of these devices can host an MC client specified by 3GPP.\nEach MC service supports several types of communications amongst the users (e.g. group call, private call). There are several common functions and entities (e.g. group, configuration, identity) which are used by the MC services.\nThe common functional architecture to support MC services utilises aspects of the IMS architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [9], the Proximity-based Services (ProSe) architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.303 [14], the Group Communication System Enablers for LTE (GCSE_LTE) architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.468 [18] and the PS-PS access transfer procedures defined in 3GPP TS 23.237 [10].\nThe MC service UE primarily obtains access to a MC service via E-UTRAN, using the EPS architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.401 [17]. Certain MC service functions such as dispatch and administrative functions can be supported using either MC service UEs in E-UTRAN or using MC service UEs via non-3GPP access networks. External applications usage of MC services can be enabled via E-UTRAN or non-3GPP access networks.\nNOTE:\tDispatch consoles and devices used by MC service administrators are considered MC service UEs in the common functional architecture to support MC services.",

For individual MC service group affiliation and MCservice group de-affiliation, the requirements are specified in the corresponding MC service TS.\nNOTE 1:\tA combined affiliation to multiple MC services for a single MC service group is not specified in the current document.\nMC service group affiliation can be achieved through the following two methods:\na)\tExplicit affiliation: An MC service client indicates interest in one or many MC service groups to the MC service server. This interest may be initiated either by an MC service user using the MC service UE, or by an automatic procedure within the MC service client that indicates that the MC service user is interested in the MC service group at that MC service client. An authorized MC service user may remotely modify another MC service user's affiliation to an MC service group.\nb)\tImplicit affiliation: An MC service user's affiliations to MC service groups are determined through configurations and policies within the MC service and performed by the associated MC service server.\nNOTE 2:\tMC service group affiliation is not the same as MC service group membership; however, an MC service user is a member of an MC service group prior to becoming an affiliated member of that MC service group.\nThe MC service server may refuse a request for affiliation from an MC service user to an MC service group, in which case the MC service user will be unable to take part in the requested MC service associated with that MC service group, and the MC service client should make the MC service user aware that the MC service user is not affiliated to the MC service group for the requested MC service. The MC service server may also de-affiliate an MC service client from an MC service group following a relevant trigger condition.\nMC service group de-affiliation indicates that the MC service user is no longer interested in that MC service group, either at the MC service client, or across all MC service clients depending on MC service group configuration, and therefore is unable to perform any actions that are associated with an affiliated member (e.g. receive media, notifications). MC service group de‑affiliation can occur due to either an MC service client's explicit request, or implicitly i.e. changed by the MC service server as the result of another action e.g. the MC service user logging off. When the MC service user is logged off from the MC service, all affiliations shall be revoked in the MC service server even if no explicit de-affiliation signalling is sent.\nEditor's note:\tThe interaction of logoff and de-affiliation when moving to off network case is FFS.\nNOTE 3:\tWhen the MC service user next performs successful service authorization, re-affiliation occurs in the MC service server without explicit affiliation signalling for all MC service groups that are configured for implicit affiliation after service authorization.\nNOTE 4:\tThe MC service client may also store MC service groups to which the MC service user was affiliated prior to that user logging off, and may re-affiliate through an explicit affiliation to these groups following the next service authorization.

The MC service ID identifies an MC service user. The MC service ID may also identify one or more MC service user profiles for the user at the application layer.\nThere are attributes associated with the MC service ID configured in the MC service that relate to the human user of the MC service. Typically, this information identifies the MC service user, by name or role, may also identify a user's organization or agency, and may also identify MC service user's service subscription to one or more MC services. Such attributes associated with an MC service ID can be used by the MC service server to make authorization decisions about the MC service granted to the user. For example, if the MC service user is subscribed to MCPTT service, an attribute that identifies a user's role as an incident commander could automatically be used by the MCPTT service to grant the user additional administrative rights over the creation of groups, or access to privileged talk groups.\nThe MC service ID shall be a URI. The MC service ID uniquely identifies an MC service user in an MC system. The MC service ID indicates the MC system where the MC service ID is defined.\nWhen required by the MC service provider, the MC service ID is hidden from the signalling control plane.\nA default or temporary MC service ID may be used where a user is not yet associated with a device. When a user would like to use one or more MC services but has not been authenticated by the identity management server, a default or temporary MC service ID and a corresponding MC service user profile may be used.\nFor the purposes of this document, an MC service administrator, MC service dispatcher, or MC service authorized user is an MC service user that has been granted special privileges within the context of the client function being performed (e.g. MC service client, group management client, configuration management client, key management client). For example, the MC service ID of a group management client of an MC service administrator can be authorized within the group management server to create new groups and add members to groups (i.e. administrative function), but is not authorized to dynamically create group or user regroups (i.e. operational function). Alternatively, for example, the MC service ID of a dispatcher will typically be authorized to dynamically create group and user regroups, but is not authorized to create new groups or add/delete members to groups.

This includes PDN connection information corresponding to the configured MC services on the MC service UE (see \"EPS bearer considerations\" in the 3GPP TS 23.379 [16]) and on-network server identity information for all application plane servers with which the MC service UE needs to interact. See annex A.6 for more information.\nThe MC service UE is provided with UE configuration, MC service user profile configuration and group configuration via online configuration. While the MC service UE is using the MC service it may receive online configuration updates. When this happens, the MC service UE shall apply these updates and use them for further operations. If the MC service user profile configuration contains multiple MC service user profiles for an authenticated MC service user, then the MC service client and MC service server set the active MC service user profile to the configured pre-selected MC service user profile after MC service authorization (which can be updated by the MC service user using the procedure specified in subclause 10.1.4.6). The active MC service user profile can be changed by the MC service user to a different MC service user profile during MC service service (see MC service TSs).\nThe MC service is configured with the service configuration (not shown in the figure 10.1.1.1-1) which the MC service enforces during the entire phase of MC service UE using the MC service.\nEditor's note:\tThe extent of MC services available to an MC service UE with an unauthenticated MC user or unauthorized MC service user is described as 'limited services' in 3GPP TS 33.180 and is FFS.",

      "content": "Figure 10.1.1.2‑1 depicts a general MC service configuration time sequence of the data related to MC service, representing the general lifecycle of MC service UE which obtains MC service when migrated to a partner MC system. The MC service user can only receive MC service from one MC system at a time.\nFigure 10.1.1.2-1 MC service UE configuration sequence for migration\nThe MC service user and MC service UE first follow the MC service UE configuration and MC service user authorization steps described in subclause 10.1.1.1 to obtain one or more MC service user profiles from the primary MC system. Each user profile received from the primary MC system contains a list of partner MC systems to which migration is permitted using that user profile, together with the access information needed to communicate with the application plane servers of the partner MC system. See Annex A.3 for more information. The MC service user also obtains the necessary security parameters needed to authenticate and become service authorized on the partner MC system; the process for this is specified in 3GPP TS 33.180 [25].  At this point, the MC UE is configured sufficiently for the partner system so that the MC service user is capable of utilizing \"limited services\" as described in 3GPP TS 33.180 [25].\nNOTE 1:\tThe above steps which enable migration to take place may be carried out some time in advance of migration. The MC service user could repeatedly obtain migrated MC service, e.g. on successive days while located in the area of the partner MC system, without needing to obtain the initial configuration afresh in advance of each period of migrated MC service. The user profile from the primary MC system must be retained to provide the access information to permit this.\nTo initiate migration, the desired partner system from those listed in the chosen user profile is selected, and the access information provided in the user profile is used to initiate communication with the partner MC system.\nNOTE 2:\tSelection of the relevant partner MC system could be performed as a result of a manual action by the user or automatically by an application in the MC service UE, e.g. according to the current location of the MC service UE or according to the serving PLMN of the MC service UE.\nThe MC service user performs user authentication to the partner MC system as specified in 3GPP TS 33.180 [25].\nThe user profile or profiles for that MC service user which are to be used for service when migrated to the partner MC system are then downloaded to the configuration management client in the MC service UE by the partner MC system, and these downloaded profile or profiles are used by the MC service user during the ensuing period of MC service on the partner MC system.\nNOTE 3:\tThe user profile obtained from the primary MC system is simply used to provide access information for the partner MC system and is not otherwise used by the MC service client during migrated MC service.\nGroup configuration for the MC service groups listed in the user profile are then obtained by the group management client in the MC service UE. After these configuration steps, the MC service user obtains service authorization on the partner MC system.\nOnce service authorized, further configuration changes may be provided by the partner MC system during the period of operational MC service, in accordance with subclause 10.1.1.1. The partner MC system enforces the use of the user profiles and group configuration that have been provided by the configuration process described in this subclause.",

      "content": "An MC service user is identified by an MC service ID. An MC service ID is associated with at least one MC service user profile and can be associated with multiple MC service user profiles (identified by an index and optionally a profile name). This is depicted in figure 10.1.4.1-1.\nFigure 10.1.4.1-1: The relationship of MC service user, MC service IDs, MC service user profile and MC services\nFor an MC service user there can be multiple MC service IDs with the constraint that only one MC service ID exists for a given MC service for that MC service user (e.g. MC service ID X may correspond to MCPTT service and MC service ID Y may correspond to MCVideo service). When the MC service provider requires to support a single MC service ID for all MC services, the value of the multiple MC service IDs is the same (e.g. value of MC service ID X is same as MC service ID Y).\nIn the case where a single MC service ID is configured for a MC service user for authorized access to multiple MC services, the MC service UE and MC service server shall include the indication of the specific MC service during the communication.\nFor the same MC service user there can be different MC service user profiles active on different MC service UEs or different MC service user profiles active on the same MC service UE at different times. The MC service user may have one or more specific MC service user profiles defined for use in migration cases, whereby there may be more than one MC service user profiles defined for migration for that MC service user e.g. so that different MC service user profiles can be applied in different partner MC systems. The appropriate MC service user profile for migration for the relevant partner MC system will be provided to the partner MC system by the procedure. For both the cases of MC service on the primary MC system of the MC service user, and MC service when migrating to a partner MC system, only one MC service user profile per MC service client is active at a time.\nAll MC service user profiles associated with an MC service user are stored in the MC service user database. Different parts of the MC service user profile are provisioned by the Mission Critical Organization, by the MC service provider and by the MC service user, respectively.\nMC service user profile information is downloaded to the MC service UE. The MC service user profile configuration may include more than one information exchange e.g. the configuration management server may provide the MC service UE with a list of some or all enabled MC service user profiles to allow the MC service user to select one (where the list may contain a subset of the MC service user profile information sufficient for the MC service user to distinguish which MC service user profile to select).\nWhen an MC service user is receiving MC service in its primary MC system, the MC service user profile provisioning in the UE is initiated by the configuration management client (e.g. upon MC service user authentication or on reconnect to the MC service), or initiated by the configuration management server (e.g. due to role change or organization change). For a migrating MC service user, the MC service user profile provisioning in the UE is initiated when the MC service user attempts to migrate to a partner MC system, and requests the MC service user profile from a nominated configuration management server in the partner MC system, prior to requesting service authorization from a partner MC service server.\nThe partner MC system may require that the MC service user profiles for migrating MC service users have parameters imposed by that partner MC system according to its operating and security policies.  For example, there may be limitations in the locations at which migrating MC users can receive service, specific priority levels for migrating MC service users or certain groups to which the migrating MC service users require access. The partner MC system applies any necessary modifications to the MC service user profile received from the primary MC system of the MC service user in accordance with its local requirements. This local profile will be stored, and will be provided to the configuration management server in the partner MC system in order to distribute it to the configuration management client of the migrating MC service user. This modified profile may be sent to the primary MC system of the migrating MC service user so that the primary MC system can validate the modified profile before it is provided to the migrating MC service UE. The modified MC service user profile will subsequently be provided to the MC service server in the partner MC system when the migrating MC user attempts service authorization.\nEditor's note: A reference should be added to configuration tables in Annex A to indicate where the local configuration policy can be configured.",

An MC service client monitors an MBMS bearer to receive MC service media. Based on the received quality (e.g. radio level quality, transport level quality), the MC service client needs to inform the MC service server that the MC service client is able to receive the MC service media on the MBMS bearer with sufficient quality or not able to receive the MC service media on the MBMS bearer with sufficient quality. Furthermore, based on the received quality, the MC service client may notify the MC service server at which MBMS reception quality level it has received the MC service media on the MBMS bearer.\nThe issue can be more complex since the MC service client needs to estimate the quality of the bearer even in the scenario when there are no data currently transmitted on the MBMS bearer (e.g. between MCPTT group call). The reason for this is that an MC service client that has entered an area with significantly degraded MBMS quality, might not even notice that an MC service communication is ongoing, meanwhile the MC server still assumes that the MC service client can receive the media being broadcasted.\nTo estimate the MBMS bearer quality, for example as an equivalent BLER (Block Error Rate), when no data is sent is implementation specific. This estimation can be dependent on for example the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) and measurements from the reference signals from the eNB(s).

The MC service client may determine the MBMS bearer quality by using the BLER of the received data. When no data is received, the quality estimation can consider the reference signals and the modulation and coding scheme (MCS). The UE may also use predictive methods to estimate the expected MBMS bearer quality (e.g. speed and direction) to proactively inform the MBMS service server of an expected loss of the MBMS bearer quality. The MC service client may also map the determined MBMS bearer quality to a MBMS reception quality level. The MBMS reception quality level indicates at which specific MBMS bearer quality level the MC service media has been received. Based on the MBMS reception quality level, the MC service server may efficiently decide to switch to another bearer or to take measures to prepare such a switch.\nEditor's note:\tThe set of MBMS reception quality levels and the mapping of the determined MBMS bearer quality to those levels are FFS.\nNOTE 1:\tWhen MBSFN transmission is used, the MBSFN reference signal needs to be used and when SC-PTM is used the cell specific reference signal needs to be used.

      "content": "The service continuity solution described in this subclause is suitable in the scenario when multiple MBMS bearers are used with the purpose to cover a larger area. In mission critical communication several media streams may be multiplexed in one MBMS bearer. Furthermore, one media stream (e.g. MCPTT group call) may be sent on more than one MBMS bearer if the receiving users are distributed over more than one MBMS service area. An MC service client that is interested in receiving a media stream that is broadcasted in both MBMS bearers is a candidate for this service continuity procedure.\nFigure 10.7.3.7.2-1 illustrates a deployment scenario that provides service continuity between two MBSFN areas. Two different MBMS bearers are activated (TMGI 1 and TMGI 2), the activation of the bearers is done in the two MBSFN areas (MBSFN 1 and MBSFN 2). The MBSFN areas 1 and 2 are partially overlapping, meaning that some transmitting cells belong to both MBSFN area 1 and MBSFN area 2.\nFigure 10.7.3.7.2-1: Two MBMS bearer using overlapping MBSFN areas\nThe procedural steps will work as follows:\nFigure 10.7.3.7.2-2: Service continuity when moving from one MBSFN to another\n1.\tThe UE is located in MBSFN 1 and can listen to TMGI 1. No additional MBMS bearers that the MC service client is interested in are active in the current cell.\n2.\tThe MC service client notifies the MC service server that it is successfully receiving the MC service media over TMGI 1. The MC service client may also notify the MBMS reception quality level of TMGI 1.\nNOTE 1:\tThe MBMS reception quality level may be used by the MC service server to make an efficient decision to switch to another MBMS bearer or to a unicast bearer, or to take measures to prepare such a switch (e.g. when the quality level indicates that the reception quality of the MBMS bearer is decreasing or reaching an insufficient quality level for the reception of MC services).\n3.\tThe UE moves into a new cell in which both TMGI 1 and TMGI 2 are active. This cell is part of both MBSFN area 1 and MBSFN area 2, and broadcast the same service on both TMGIs.\n4.\tLocation information are provided from the MC service UE via the Location management client to the Location management server. For that, the MC service UE uses the SAI information found in the system information block (SIB) transmitted by the radio cells. The location management server provides the location information to the MC service server.\nNOTE 2:\tWhether the MC service server has subscribed for notifications, as described in clause 10.9.3.6.1 of the present document, Event-trigger location information notification procedure, or uses on-demand requests, as described in clause 10.9.3.6.2 of the present document, On-demand usage of location information procedure, is out of scope.\n5.\tThe MC service server sends to the MC service client a MBMS bearer announcement with information related to TMGI 2 (if the MC service server had not done it before). Hence, the MC service client knows that TMGI 2 transmits the same MC service media.\n6.\tThe MC service client notifies the MC service server that it is successfully receiving TMGI 1 and TMGI 2. The MC service client may also notify the MBMS reception quality level per TMGI.\n7.\tThe MC service client may receive the MC service media over both MBMS bearers, i.e. TMGI 1 and TMGI 2. The MC service client may also verify that it is the same content sent on both bearers. The duplicated packets may also be used to perform error corrections.\n8.\tThe UE moves into a new cell in MBSFN area 2, where only TMGI 2 is active.\n9.\tThe MC service client notifies the MC service server that it is successfully receiving the MC service media over TMGI 2. The MC service client may also notify the MBMS reception quality level of TMGI 2.\n10.\tThe MC service client receives the MC service media only over TMGI 2.\nThis service continuity procedure mitigates the risk of packet loss that may occur if the UE would request to transfer the media stream to a unicast bearer when moving into the new area and then back to a multicast bearer when the UE can listen to TMGI 2. However, it is still required that the MC service client sends a location report (and MBMS listening report), as described in steps 4-6 above. To send the location report and the MBMS listening report by the MC service client to the MC service server a unicast bearer is needed. The location report from the MC service client is required, since the MC service server must know that the UE has entered a new area and can only listen to MBMS bearer active in that area. If this is not done the MC service server might send a media stream that the MC service client is required to listen to on the MBMS bearer 1, since the MC service server still assumes that the UE is located in the MBSFN area 1.\nThe solution can be improved as illustrated in figure 10.7.3.7.2-3. In this case two different MBMS bearers are activated (TMGI 1 and TMGI 2), these MBMS bearers are used only for media. An application level signalling bearer is activated (TMGI 9), in both MBSFN areas. This bearer is used for floor control messages and other application level signalling messages that are sent on the MBMS bearer TMGI 9. A similar concept was already introduced in 3GPP TS 23.179 [7] subclause 10.10.2, where the procedure allowed a separate MBMS bearer for floor control signalling. The application level signalling bearer will be used for all control messages needed for both media MBMS bearer (TMGI 1 and TMGI2).\nBy using an application level signalling bearer (e.g. TMGI 9) the MC service clients can receive floor control messages for all calls going on in the areas of both TMGI 1 and TMGI 2. A MC service client that is located in the area of TMGI 2 and is interested in a MCPTT group call transmission only going on in TMGI 1, can with the information received in TMGI 9 initiate a unicast bearer and request to receive that specific call over a unicast instead. Without the information received over TMGI 9 the MC service client must immediately report that the MC service client has left the broadcast area that the MC service server assumes that the MC service client is located in. With the use of TMGI 9 there is no immediate need for the MC service client to inform the MC service server of a location change.\nFigure 10.7.3.7.2-3: Two MBMS bearer using overlapping MBSFN areas with a separate MC application signalling bearer\nThe procedural steps in this scenario will be the same as described above in this subclause. However, in this scenario the MC service client is not required to initiate a unicast bearer to send location report (or MBMS listening report). The UE may move between the two MBMS bearers (TMGI 1 and TMGI 2) without the need to report an area change. A condition for this to work is that there is an application level signalling bearer (TMGI 9) activated in the full area (i.e. the area of both TMGI 1 and TMGI 2). The TMGI 9 will broadcast all floor control messages for all calls ongoing in both areas. If the UE is in coverage of one of the two MBMS bearers that does not transmit the media of interest the UE can report to the server that it is not able to listen to the media over the MBMS bearer, which triggers the server to use a unicast bearer instead.",

      "content": "This procedure handles a scenario when UE is moving from a location when the UE is experiencing good reception of the MBMS bearer to a location outside the MBMS service coverage. The MC service client apply a service continuity procedure to ensure that the service can be maintained and that the packet loss can be minimized during transition to a UE-to-Network relay connection. The solution also provides the benefit that it offloads the cell when UEs that normally would trigger a transfer from MBMS bearers to unicast bearers when moving outside the MBMS coverage area.\nFigure 10.7.3.7.3-1 below illustrates the concept of this procedure. In the figure UE A (with the MC service client) is first within the MBMS coverage (the far right most location). The MBMS coverage is represented by the dashed circle. The UE A is the moving outside the MBMS coverage and first enters a location in which the MBMS signal is not good enough, but in this location there is still coverage to use\tunicast bearers. Unicast bearers use link adaption and retransmission so the coverage area for unicast bearers is larger than the coverage of the MBMS bearers. The solid circle outer line represents the coverage of the unicast bearer.\nA UE that is leaving the area of MBMS coverage may in this scenario trigger a ProSe discovery procedure to initiate the establishment a relay communication path to UE-R. A UE that is receiving media over an MBMS bearer (and is in idle mode) and for the moment does not need a unicast bearer is costly (from a resource efficiency point of view) to transfer to a unicast bearer due to the need for retransmissions and robust coding in the outer part of cell.\nWhen the ProSe communication path is established the UE A may continue to receive the media over the relay UE-R.\nFigure 10.7.3.7.3-1: UE A is moving from a position in MBMS coverage to outside the network coverage passing an area where only unicast is possible\nThe procedure defined in this subclause allows for MBMS bearer service continuity when UE is moving from a MBMS coverage area to outside the MBMS coverage area. The procedure applies when the UE is not finding a target cell with good RSRP/RSRQ (receiving strong reference signals from other cells), which could trigger normal cell reselection procedure. In such scenario other aspects should be evaluated to trigger to a relay communication path.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tThe MC service client UE is not using a unicast bearer when this procedure applies.\nFigure 10.7.3.7.3-2: Service continuity over MBMS bearer using UE-to-network relay\n1.\tThe MC service client estimate the MBMS bearer quality. The MC service clients also measure the reference signals from other cells to estimate the possibilities to transfer to unicast and perform a cell reselection procedure.\n2.\tIf the MBMS bearer quality has reach a certain threshold the MC service client performs ProSe UE-to-network relay discovery over PC5 and establishes a secure point-to-point link with the relay (UE-R) over PC5. As part of this process the remote UE is mutually authenticated at PC5 layer with either the relay or with the network as specified in 3GPP TS 23.303 [14].\n3.\tNormal service continuity procedure for a UE-to-network relay. This may be done according to annex B.\n4.\tThe MC service client informs the UE-R about the reception of media over the MBMS bearer. This includes sending the TMGIs, MBMS SAIs and ProSe per packet priority to the UE-R. This procedure is specified in 3GPP TS 23.303 [14].\n5.\tThe UE-R will relay the MBMS media using one-to-many ProSe Direct Communication. The UE-R may also relay requests to transfer the media flow from multicast to unicast and vice versa.",

The request is done on the MB2-C reference point. It includes the following elements: the TMGI of the bearer transporting those media, the media descriptions (codecs, transport protocols, bitrates, destination ip addresses and ports), the identification of the FEC repair packet flow (IP destination and port), an upper bound to the additional latency resulting to FEC application.  The MC Service server may perform this request several times to protect separately different sets of media transported within the same MBMS bearer.\n2.\tIf the BM-SC can satisfy the request, the Setup FEC response includes a modified list of media information and FEC information. The response also includes an identifier to the FEC process instance, which can be used to release the application of FEC for these media flows.\nNOTE 1:\tSource media packets may be modified by the application of FEC (e.g. addition of a footer of header), leading to a modification of the delivery protocol to be announced within the media information.\nNOTE 2:\tThe Release FEC request is not shown on the figure.\n3.\tThe MC service server announces the MBMS bearer to the MC service client with the MBMS bearer announcement procedure, including the modified list of medias information and FEC information within the SDP information.\n4.\tWhen the MC service server decides to transmit the MC service media flow for a group communication, the MC service server sends to the group a message identifying the MC service media flow and the TMGI of the MBMS bearer, such as the MapGroupToBearer message for MCPTT, specified in 3GPP TS 23.379 [16], or the MapGroupToBearer message for MCVideo, specified in 3GPP TS 23.380 [12].\n5.\tThe MC service server sends the downlink media to the BM-SC on the MB2-U reference points and according to 3GPP TS 23.468 [18].\n6. The BM-SC performs FEC encoding of the downlink media in accordance to the announced FEC algorithm and parameters and delivers it over MBMS.\n7. The MC service client performs FEC decoding of the encoded media flows in accordance to the announced FEC information and delivers the decoded flows to the media player.\nEditor's note: the need for a MC service server ability to turn off/on the production of repair packets on the BM-SC during the media transmission must be discussed, and may impact the procedure.",

      "content": "The procedure for the authorized user to remotely change another MC service user's affiliated MC service group(s) defined in partner MC systems for a single MC service without requiring the target user's approval is described in figure 10.8.5.2.1-1.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe MC service client 1 (authorized user) has already been provisioned (statically or dynamically) with the target MC service user 2's information and group information, that the target MC service user 2 is allowed to be affiliated or de-affiliated;\n2.\tThe MC service client 1 (authorized user 1), MC service client 2 (target MC service user 2), and the primary MC service server belong to the same MC system;\n3.\tThe partner MC service server may have retrieved the group related information from the group management server;\n4.\tThe primary MC service server may have retrieved the user policy e.g. user related information regarding user(s) authorization to affiliate or to de-affiliate to MC service group(s), priority, and other related configuration data; and\n5.\tThe partner group management server has subscribed to the MC service server within the MC system where the group is defined for affiliation status updates.\nFigure 10.8.5.2.1-1: Remote change MC service group affiliation defined in partner MC system – mandatory mode\n1.\tWhen an authorized user requires one or more MC service users to change the affiliation to an MC service group or set of MC service groups, the MC service client 1 of the authorized user 1 sends MC service group affiliation change request with the indication of mandatory mode to the primary MC service server. The information (i.e. target MC service user(s) ID, MC service group(s) ID, requested affiliation status) used to indicate the change of the affiliation relationship between the target MC service user 2 and the MC service group(s) shall be included.\n2.\tThe primary MC service server shall check if the MC service user 1 is authorized to initiate the change of the affiliation relationship between the target user 2 and the MC service group(s). The primary MC service server shall check if the target MC service user(s) are authorized for the requested affiliation relationship based on the user profile. The primary MC service server also performs the check for the maximum limit on the total number (N2) of MC service groups that the user can be affiliated to simultaneously.\n3.\tBased on the MC service group information included in the request, the primary MC service server determines to send MC service group affiliation change request to the corresponding partner MC service server (group host server).\n4a.\tThe partner MC service server checks if the group policy is locally cached. If the group policy is not locally cached on the partner MC service server then the partner MC service server subscribes to the group policy from the group configuration from the group management server.\n4b.\tThe partner MC service server receives the group policy from the group configuration from the group management server via notification and locally caches the group policy from the group configuration.\n5.\tBased on the group policy, the partner MC service server checks if the target MC service user 2 is authorized to affiliate to the MC service group(s). It is possible that the target MC service user 2 affiliates to one or more MC service groups and also de-affiliates from one or more MC service groups.\n6.\tIf the target MC service user 2 is authorized to affiliate or de-affiliate to the MC service group(s) and if the requested affiliation status is different to the current affiliation status, then the partner MC service server stores the new affiliation status of the target MC service user 2 for the MC service group(s).\n7.\tThe partner MC service server sends the MC service group affiliation change response to the primary MC service server.\n8.\tThe partner MC service server updates the group management server with the affiliation status of the target MC service user 2 for the MC service group(s).\nNOTE:\tSteps 7 and 8 can occur in any order or in parallel.\n9.\tIf the requested affiliation status is different to the current affiliation status, then the primary MC service server stores the new affiliation status of the target MC service user 2 for the MC service group(s).\n10a.\tIf the requested affiliation status is different to the current affiliation status, then the primary MC service server sends the MC service group affiliation change request with the indication of mandatory mode to MC service client 2 of the target MC service user 2. The target MC service user 2 receives the latest information about the affiliated MC service groups. Further the MC service client 2 may subscribe for the affiliated MC service groups information with the group management server.\n10b.\tThe target MC service client 2 provides an MC service group affiliation change response to the MC service server.\n11.\tThe primary MC service server sends the MC service group affiliation change response to MC service client 1 (authorized user). If the requested affiliation status was not changed (see 10a), then the MC service server creates an appropriate (accept) MC service group affiliation change response to send to MC service client 1.",

The procedure defined below provides the necessary coordination between MC service servers to manage high priority levels. One of the involved MC service servers is assigned the role of being a priority arbitrator among a group of MC service servers serving the same geographical area.  The priority arbitrator may also compete for the same limited network resources. Prior to using this procedure all MC service servers need to be configured with information about which MC service server will act as the priority arbitrator and under what conditions (e.g. priority level) the priority arbitrator should be used. The use of this procedure is not mandated. MC systems that support priority coordination between multiple MC service servers should support this procedure.\nPre-condition:\n1.\tOne of the MC service servers is assigned the role of the priority arbitrator.\n2.\tIt is assumed that all MC service servers are part of the same trusted domain.\n3.\tA MC communication session is ongoing or is about to commence. The operational situation together with static and dynamic attributes requires the use of elevated priority for network resources.\nEditor's note:\tIt is FFS if enforcement of the granted priority can be applied to MC service servers outside of the same trusted domain\nEditor's note:\tIt is FFS how the MC service server 2 (priority arbitrator) knows about ongoing traffic.\nFigure 10.12.3-1: Priority arbitration between multiple MC service servers\n1.\tA need for high priority level is identified by the MC service server 1. The priority level identified is above the level of priority that the MC service server 1 can utilise without centralized priority arbitration.\n2.\tThe MC service server 1 sends a MC priority request to the MC service server being assigned the priority arbitrator role. The request includes the geographical area, duration, the priority level, service type and needed capacity.\n3.\tThe priority arbitrator determines whether to grant, reject or queue the request for elevated priority.\nNOTE 1:\tHow the priority arbitrator makes this determination is out of scope of the present document.\nNOTE 2:\tOne source of information for the priority arbitrator to evaluate the priority request, could be information received at the resource reservations over the Rx reference point. Example of such information is resource request failure and Retry-Interval AVP which could be an indication of RAN user plane congestion, see reference 3GPP TS 29.214 [27].\n4.\tThe priority arbitrator grants MC service server 1 the elevated priority\n5.\tThe priority arbitrator notifies other MC service servers about the elevated priority granted to other services.\nNOTE 3:\tThe behaviour of the MC service servers that receive this information is implementation specific.

Messages to MC service clients need to be sent from the MC service server serving each MC user.

The configuration data in each configuration category corresponds to a single instance of the category type i.e. the MC service UE, MC service group, MC service user and MC service configuration data refers to the information that will be stored against each MC service UE, MC service group, MC service user and MC service. This means that the three separate tables (on-network and off-network, on-network only, off-network only) for each configuration category represent the complete set of data for each configuration data category element.\nThe columns in the tables have the following meanings:\n-\tReference: the reference of the corresponding requirement in 3GPP TS 22.280 [3] or 3GPP TS 22.281 [4] or 3GPP TS 22.282 [5] or 3GPP TS 22.179 [2] or the corresponding subclause from the present document.\n-\tParameter description: A short definition of the semantics of the corresponding item of data, including denotation of the level of the parameter in the configuration hierarchy.\n-\tWhen it is not clear to which functional entities the parameter is configured, then one or more columns indicating this are provided where the following nomenclature is used:\n-\t\"Y\" to denote \"Yes\" i.e. the parameter denoted for the row needs to be configured to the functional entity denoted for the column.\n-\t\"N\" to denote \"No\" i.e. the parameter denoted for the row does not need to be configured to the functional entity denoted for the column.\nParameters within a set of configuration data have a level within a hierarchy that pertains only to that configuration data. The hierarchy of the configuration data is common across all the three tables of on-network and off‑network, on‑network only and off‑network only. The level of a parameter within the hierarchy of the configuration data is denoted by use of the character \">\" in the parameter description field within each table, one per level. Parameters that are at the top‑most level within the hierarchy have no \">\" character. Parameters that have one or more \">\" characters are child parameters of the first parameter above them that has one less \">\" character. Parent parameters are parameters that have one or more child parameters. Parent parameters act solely as a \"grouping\" of their child parameters and therefore do not contain an actual value themselves i.e. they are just containers for their child parameters.\nEach parameter that can be configured online shall only be configured through one online reference point. Each parameter that can be configured offline shall only be configured through one offline reference point. The most recent configuration data made available to the MC service UE shall always overwrite previous configuration data, irrespective of whether the configuration data was provided via the online or offline mechanism.\nA.2\tMC service UE configuration data\nMC service UE configuration data has to be known by an MC service UE after MC service authorization. The CSC-4 reference point is used for configuration between the configuration management server and the configuration management client on the MC service UE when the MC service UE is on-network.\nMC service UE configuration data can be configured offline using the CSC-11 reference point.\nMC service UE configuration data is specific to each MC service and is specified as follows:\n-\tMCPTT UE configuration data is specified in 3GPP TS 23.379 [16];\n-\tMCVideo UE configuration data is specified in 3GPP TS 23.281 [12]; and\n-\tMCData UE configuration data is specified in 3GPP TS 23.282 [13].\nWithin each MC service, the MC service UE configuration data can be the same or different across MC service UEs.\nA.3\tMC service user profile configuration data\nThe MC service user profile configuration data is stored in the MC service user database. The configuration management server is used to configure the MC service user profile configuration data to the MC service user database (CSC-13) and MC service UE (CSC-4).\nMC service user profile configuration data can be configured offline using the CSC-11 reference point.\nMC service user profile configuration data is specific to each MC service and is specified as follows:\n-\tMCPTT user profile configuration data is specified in 3GPP TS 23.379 [16];\n-\tMCVideo user profile configuration data is specified in 3GPP TS 23.281 [12];\n-\tMCData user profile configuration data is specified in 3GPP TS 23.282 [13]; and\n-\tLocation user profile configuration data is specified in clause A.8.\nA.4\tGroup configuration data\nThe group configuration data is stored in the group management server. The group management server is used to configure the group configuration data to the MC service UE (CSC-2) and the MC service server (CSC-3).\nA single group can support one or multiple MC service configurations.

For illustration, MCPTT AS is considered as the MC service.\nOnly the procedure for service continuity from on-network MCPTT service to UE-to-network relay MCPTT service is described in figure B.1-1. The procedure for service continuity in the opposite direction is identical.\nFigure B.1-1: Service continuity from on-network to UE-to-network relay\nAs illustrated in figure B.1-1:\n-\tInitially UE-1 has a direct connection to the network (on-network MCPTT service). It is registered with the SIP core and is engaged in a SIP session with the MCPTT Application Server (solid lines SIP-1 and MCPTT-1 in figure B.1-1).\n-\tWhen UE-1 realises that it is losing connection to the network, or after the connection to the network has been lost, UE-1 discovers a UE-to-network relay (UE-R) and establishes a PC5 connection with UE-R. UE-1 registers with the SIP core over the target access leg and enters UE-to-network relay MCPTT service by transferring the media streams over the target leg (dashed lines SIP-1 and MCPTT-1 in figure B.1-1).\n-\tThe SIP session is anchored at a Service Centralisation and Continuity Application Server (SCC AS) before and after the handover, as described in 3GPP TS 23.237 [10].\nDepicted in figure B.1-2 is the call flow for service continuity when the UE switches from on-network MCPTT service to UE-to-network MCPTT relay service.\nFigure B.1-2 Service continuity when UE switches from on-network MCPTT service to UE-to-network relay MCPTT service\n0. UE-1 has a direct connection to the network and is engaged in a SIP session with the MCPTT AS (on-network MCPTT service). The SIP session is anchored at a Service Centralisation and Continuity Application Server (SCC AS) and a Session transfer Identifier (STI) is assigned for the anchored SIP session, as described in 3GPP TS 23.237 [10].\n1. UE-1 realises that it is losing connection to the network or has completely lost it.\n2. UE-1 (in the role of remote UE) performs ProSe UE-to-network relay discovery over PC5 and establishes a secure point-to-point link with the relay (UE-R) over PC5. As part of this process the remote UE is mutually authenticated at PC5 layer with either the relay or with the network as specified in 3GPP TS 23.303 [14]. In the process UE-1 is also assigned an IP address/prefix by the relay.\nNOTE 1:\tIf step 2 is started after losing connection, the service interruption can be noticeable to the user.\nNOTE 2:\tStep 2 will be entirely described under in 3GPP TS 23.303 [14].\n3: UE-1 registers with the SIP core over the UE-to-network relay leg.\n4. In order to transfer the media streams of the SIP session UE-1 sends an INVITE message on the new access leg towards the SCC AS. The INVITE message includes the STI identifying the session to be transferred. The SCC AS identifies the session based on STI and updates the session over the remote access leg i.e. towards the MCPTT AS.\n5. The procedure is completed when all media streams have been transferred on the access leg relayed via UE-R. At this point UE-1 may deregister the on-network leg if it still has direct network connection (not shown in the figure).\nNOTE 3:\tThe procedure for service continuity is always completed with unicast delivery on the target side. If MCPTT content is being distributed on the target side in multicast mode, then switching from unicast to multicast delivery is performed after completion of the service continuity procedure.\nAnnex C (informative):Application Priority\nC.1\tUse of application priorities\nDifferent communications between two or more MC service users need to be distinguished in their urgency in order to appropriately or less preferably allocate 3GPP system transport resources. Also simultaneous incoming communications to a MC service user requires an indication of the urgency in order to preferentially join the communication in accordance with the urgency.\nTo make this distinction of urgencies, the MC system necessarily supports different types of priorities and corresponding levels within each priority category representing the relative importance of a request at the application level. The use of application priority allows the MC system to decide whether a communication establishment or modification request can be accepted or needs to be rejected (e.g. in case of transport resource limitations), or it allows the MC service client to rank simultaneous incoming communication for presentation to an MC service user. Hence the application priority can also be used to decide which existing transport resources (e.g. bearers) to pre-empt during resource limitations. Such pre-emption capability information defines whether a communication can obtain transport resources that were already assigned to another communication with a lower priority level. The pre-emption vulnerability information defines whether a communication can lose the resources assigned to it in order to admit a communication with higher priority level.\nThe following types of application priorities are provided by the MC system:\nFigure C.1.-1: Types of application priorities in the MC system\nCommunication priority involves a combination of the type of call/communication, the role of the requesting MC service user, and the predefined/requested priority of the initiating MC service user and/or group.\nPresentation priority involves the determination of which communications, from within multiple simultaneous possible, are the highest priority to present to the MC service user either audibly or visibly. An example would be a private call received at the same time as an emergency call on a monitored group. This category can be configured uniquely for each MC service user.\nFloor priority involves the determination of who can transmit within a communication at a particular time. This is essentially the priority of the MC service user according to its profile, and possibly modified by its role and/or mode of service (e.g. using emergency or imminent peril call). This category is used, for example, to determine the ordering of the floor control queue within an established communication.\nAnnex D (informative):Considerations for MC gateway UE selection\nD.1\t\tGeneral\nOperating conditions can influence the selection and the use of the MC gateway UE.\nMultiple conditions can be considered by the non-3GPP device either to connect to another MC gateway UE (e.g. with better operating conditions for the requested service), or to re-connect to the same MC gateway UE (e.g. reattempt connection after a certain time).\nD.2\t\tPotential operating conditions\nPossible operating conditions information could belong to one of the following categories:\nMC gateway UE capacity limits\nThe MC gateway UE might not be able to allow non-3GPP devices to connect when the limit of connected MC clients has been reached.\n3GPP access congestion\nThe MC gateway UE can make use of to the special Categories/Access Identity, the preferential access applies based on its assigned Access Control Class/Access Identity during periods of congestion. The MC gateway UE subscription allows to obtain priority treatment for the required communication.\nNevertheless, the serving access network can indicate to the UEs (including MC gateway UE) that Access Class Barring applies and this can be passed by the MC gateway UE to the non-3GPP device.\nPLMN reselection\nPLMN reselection depends on operator policy, roaming agreements, and on national/regional regulatory requirements.\nNetwork status information\nIf the network status information of an EPS/5GS capability available at MC gateway UE, it can be further propagated to the corresponding non-3GPP devices for further processing (e.g., if the requested QoS for service can be provided for MC client or not).\nAnnex E (informative):MC gateway UE routing capabilities\nE.1\tGeneral\nThe use of the MC gateway UE requires the support of an IP network behind the MC gateway UE, that a range of IP addresses are reachable over a single MC gateway UE. That enables the forwarding of signalling information and media plane between non-3GPP devices and MC server by the MC gateway UE.\nE.2\tMC client IP address association\nThe use of a unique IP address by the MC clients shall be ensured for the period of association of the MC clients via the MC gateway UE with the IMS/SIP core and the MC server. Each MC gateway UE requires a unique IP address range for their MC client association which is known by the MC service environment and a correlation between the MC client's IP address and the MC gateway UE's IP address exists.\nFigure E.2-1: MC client IP address relationship\nFramed routing in accordance with IETF RFC 2865 [32], IETF RFC 3162 [33], 3GPP TS 23.501 [34] shall be used to enable the support of an IP network behind the MC gateway UE, such that a range of IP addresses is reachable over a single 3GPP transport session. It allows the routing of packets to IP addresses that do not belong to the PDN/PDU session of the MC gateway UE.\nNOTE:\tThe MC gateway UE can provide necessary IP address allocation to MC clients, e.g., as a DHCP relay agent in accordance with IETF RFC 1541 [35] and IETF RFC 8415 [36], or as a requesting router in accordance with IETF RFC 8415 [36] and 3GPP TS 23.401 [17] when using IPv6 prefix delegation.\nE.3\tIP address association using the MC gateway UE\nIf the MC client relies on IP address provided by the MC gateway UE, the MC gateway UE shall store the correlation between the non-3GPP device and the IP address (MC gateway UE IP and the local IP) used by the MC client . The  procedures initiated by the MC client, i.e., SIP registration, user authentication and service authorisation use the MC gateway UE's IP address.\nThe MC gateway UE assigns the local IPs from address pool which it maintains to the individual MC clients. Managing the local IP addresses, re-using the local IP address, and how the traffic is routed between the MC clients and the network is left for implementation.\nFigure E.3-1: Non-3GPP device uses MC gateway UE's IP address\nAnnex F (informative):Change history\nChange history\nDate\nMeeting\nTDoc\nCR\nRev\nCat\nSubject/Comment\nNew version\n2016-04\nInitial version.\n0.0.0\n2016-04\nAlignment with the following Rel-13 CRs agreed at SA6#10:\nCR0057(S6-160312), CR0063(S6-160189),\nCR0065(S6-160362),CR0068(S6-160348),\nCR0069(S6-160313), CR0070(S6-160280),\nCR0071(S6-160199), CR0079(S6-160360),\nCR0080(S6-160297), CR0085(S6-160361),\nCR0092(S6-160345), CR0095(S6-160339),\nCR0099(S6-160342)\n0.1.0\n2016-06\nImplemented the following pCRs approved in SA6#11:\nS6-160378, S6-160489, S6-160492, S6-160504,\nS6-160524, S6-160528, S6-160560, S6-160561,\nS6-160570, S6-160578, S6-160579, S6-160583,\nS6-160600, S6-160601\nAlso implemented the Rapporteur actions from SA6#11:\n1.
