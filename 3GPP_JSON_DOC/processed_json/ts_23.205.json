The stage 2 shall cover the information flow between the GMSC server, MSC server and media gateways. Note that nothing in the present document shall preclude an implementation of a combined MSC Server and MGW. The present document shall show the CS core network termination of the Iu interface in order to cover the information flow stimulus to the core network and describe the interaction with the supplementary and value added services and capabilities.\nFor the purposes of the present document, the protocol used over the Nc interface is an enhanced call control protocol supporting call bearer separation such as BICC (which is specified in [22]). The protocol used over the Mc interface is H.248 (which is specified in 3GPP TS 29.232 [6]). Existing specifications and recommendations shall not be repeated, as such the relevant specification shall be referred to.\nSIP-I based CS core network is further specified in 3GPP TS 23.231 [42].\nLocal Call Local Switch (LCLS) functionality is further specified in 3GPP TS 23.284 [45].\nThe present document is applicable only for ATM or IP transport in the CS core network.\nFigure 1: CS core network logical architecture\nThe CAP interfaces and the interfaces towards the HLR are outside the scope of the present document.\nDetails of Transcoder-Free Operation are outside the scope of the present document. Please see 3GPPTS 23.153 [3] for more information.\nThe present document specifies functions, procedures and information which apply to GERAN Iu mode. However, functionality related to GERAN Iu mode is neither maintained nor enhanced.",

It is also assumed that only one bearer has been established towards RNC-A.In the example the MSC server requests seizure of RNC-B side bearer termination with specific flow directions. The MSC server orders the establishment of the bearer by sending Relocation Request towards RNC-B. When the relocation is detected in RNC-B the MSC server requests to change the flow directions between the terminations within the context. When the MSC server receives a Relocation Complete indication from RNC-B it orders RNC-A to release the IU. This action causes release of the bearer between the RNC and the MGW.

When the relocation is detected in RNC-B the MSC-A server requests to change the flow directions between the terminations within the context in MGW-A. When the MSC-A server receives a Relocation Complete indication from RNC-B it transfers this indication to MSC-B server. MSC-B server orders RNC-A to release the IU. This action causes release of the bearer between RNC-A and the MGW-B. MSC-A server initiates call clearing towards MSC-B server.\nFigure 8.6/1: Subsequent Inter-MSC SRNS Relocation back to the Anchor MSC(message sequence chart)\nFigure 8.6/2: Subsequent Inter-MSC SRNS Relocation back to the Anchor MSC(message sequence chart)",

The MSC server should select the MGW which is already in use for the active call. If out-of-band transcoder control is applied for the waiting speech call, it shall be performed in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.153 [3].\nExisting call on hold\nThe clause \"Hold request\" in clause 13.6 applies.\nExisting call released\nIf the active call is disconnected while another call is waiting, the bearer termination towards the waiting party (C) as well as to the called party (A) is not removed.\nAcceptance of waiting call\nIf the mobile subscriber decides to accept the waiting call, it handles (according to 3GPP TS 23.083 [13]) the existing call as described in clause 13.5 (i.e. it either puts the call on hold or the call is released). When the MSC server receives the connect indication from subscriber A, if required the MSC server shall modify the access bearer as described in clause 13.18.1. Finally, the MSC server shall connect the access side bearer termination to the previously created bearer termination of the remote party in the waiting call and modify the waiting call's bearer termination so that it is both-way through-connected.\nIf a different MGW is selected for the incoming call, then a bearer from the new MGW (MGW2) shall be connected towards the old MGW (MGW1) before offering the call to the subscriber A.\nIf out-of-band transcoder control is applied for the waiting speech call, it shall be performed in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.153[3].\nWaiting call released by calling subscriber (subscriber C)\nThe respective resources already allocated at the selected MGW for the waiting call shall be released.\nExample\nFigure 13.13 shows the network model for a waiting call at the serving MSC server/MGW.

The \"dotted\" line represents the bearer control signalling and the bearer. Note that for a TDM access there is no separation between the call and bearer control signalling. In the following example it is assumed that each party participating in the Multi Party conference is handled in a separate context representing the call leg between the Multi Party bridge and the Multi Party participant. The Multi Party bridge itself is handled in a separate context. This separation to several contexts is done in order to simplify interactions with other functionality, such as handover, even though other implementation options are not excluded.\nFigure 13.19: Multi Party call (Network model)\nFor the purposes of the information flow diagrams it is assumed that there are only two remote parties. Party A is the subscriber controlling the Multi Party service (served mobile subscriber). Party B is the held party and party C is the active party.\nIt is assumed that the Multi Party bridge is located in the MGW that has been selected for the served mobile subscriber.\nFigure 13.20 shows the message sequence example for the beginning of multi party call. When the served mobile subscriber invokes a Multi Party service the MSC server requests the MGW to create a separate context for the Multi Party bridge. The MSC server seizes a bearer termination for each party in that context. In addition, each call leg is represented by a separate context. Therefore the parties in the active call will be split in separate contexts. The MSC server requests the MGW to create a new context and to move the bearer termination for the served mobile subscriber from the active call context to the new context. To connect the parties to the Multi Party bridge the MSC server requests the MGW to establish internal Nb connections between the bearer terminations in the Multi Party bridge context and the call leg contexts, using the standard external bearer setup procedures. The held party is informed about the retrieval of the held call, and the both remote parties are informed about the multi party call establishment.\nFigure 13.20: Information flow for multi party call, internal ATM bearer (message sequence chart)\nFigure 13.20a: Information flow for multi party call, internal IP bearer (message sequence chart)",

The stream arrives within the MGW on the termination of the traffic channel serving the cell or BSS (enhanced A-interface) and is transferred to the conference function where the summarized conference signal is calculated. The resulting stream is then transferred to all conference terminations. The normal behaviour of a conference bridge is to subtract for each conference member its own speech (incoming stream) from the summarized signal, otherwise it hears itself (outgoing stream). Therefore the Talker context need to be modified by adding a new termination to the context which is connected to the listener context (see figure 13.20.5/3 and 13.20.5/5). The topology within the talker context is set oneway from uplink of the ASCI broadcast channel in direction to Conference bridge (old termination of the talker context) and the topology is set to Oneway from the new added termination towards the termination connected to the downlink of the ASCI broadcast channel.

To connect the parties to the VGCS Multi Party Bridge the MSC server requests the MGW to establish internal Nb connections between the bearer terminations in the VGCS Multi Party bridge context and the call leg contexts, using the standard external bearer setup procedures. VGCS call acknowledge (bullet 3 in figure13.20.5/2) should be send after the ASCI broadcast channel is established in the cell where the talker is located (see 3GPP TS 43.068 [39], 3GPP TS 43.069 [40]).\nFigure 13.20.5/2: Talker on dedicated channel (Message sequence chart)\nFigure 13.20.5/3 shows a possible network model of an anchor MSC for a voice group call when the Talker is on one channel mode.\nFigure 13.20.5/3: VGCS call (termination overview for Talker on one  channel model)\nFigure 13.20.5/4 shows the message flow establishment of a VGCS call with two cells and the talker is located in cell1 when the Talker is on one channel mode.\nFigure 13.20.5/4: Talker on one channel mode (Message sequence chart)\nFigure 13.20.5/5 shows the message flow of the talker move to uplink.\nIf the MSC server decides that the talker shall use the uplink of the cell. The MSC server adds a termination to the talker context which is connected to the Listener context and changes the topology of the talker context (bullet 1 and 2 in figure 13.20.5/5).  Substract of the termination  of the talker is only performed when the MSC server decides to move an active talker to the ASCI broadcast channel (bullet 3 in figure 13.20.5/5). The termination towards the cell where the talker is located is moved to the talker context. Further talker changes or cell changes of the current talker would be handled with move commands related to the termination towards the cell where the talker is located (bullet 4 in figure 13.20.5/5).

When text based conversation is needed by a subscriber, the call is established with general call control functions like any other call. Within the call control transactions the UE indicates the need for text conversation (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [4]), which then requires actions in the core network where the pooling mechanism is chosen for GTT feature. This clause describes only the option where the CTM pool is provided in the Media Gateway in the Core Network.\nMSC Server receives an indication by the UE about the need of text conversation, allocates terminations in MGW with CTM (Cellular Text telephony Modem) capabilities for the detection of CTM signals from radio access network. The default action of the call path in the CTM-detection/conversion function in MGW is to transfer audio transparently while monitoring for text telephone signals. When valid text telephone signals are detected, the converting action of the channel takes effect. The path converts between the detected CTM at the access termination and PSTN text telephony signalling methods on the network side. This mode of operation continues until text signalling ceases. Then transparent audio transport is re-established, again monitoring for text signals.\nThe CTM channel is created with Prepare bearer for Iu/ATM terminations, Prepare IP Transport for Iu/IP terminations,Reserve circuit procedure for A interface over TDM terminations or with Reserve RTP Connection Point for A interface over IP by including Cellular Text Telephone package properties. The core network bearer shall be established with default PCM codec to carry the T.140 protocol.\nThe outcome of CTM negotiation towards the CTM user in the user plane is reported in the CTM report procedure.\nAt release the MGW may report the number of bits of Global Text Telephony data in accordance with ITU recommendation T.140 sent for the call.",
