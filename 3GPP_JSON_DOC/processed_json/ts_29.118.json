The VLR can use any SS code defined in 3GPP TS 29.002 [15], in the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message.\nIf the paging is due to a Mobile Terminated Location Request as defined in 3GPP TS 24.030 [11], the VLR shall include LCS indicator in the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message. Additionally, the VLR may include LCS client identity as defined in 3GPP TS 29.002 [15] in the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message.\nFor Deployment Option 2 (see subclause 8.2.4a.1 of 3GPP TS 23.272 [7]), if the paging was due to SMS and the SM Delivery Timer and SM Delivery Start Time IEs were received from the SMS-GMSC as defined in 3GPP TS 29.002 [15], the VLR may include these IEs in the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message.\nFor Deployment Option 2 (see subclause 8.2.4a.1 of 3GPP TS 23.272 [7]), if the paging was due to SMS and the Maximum Retransmission Time IE was received from the SMS-GMSC as defined in 3GPP TS 29.002 [15], the VLR may include the received Maximum Retransmission Time IE in the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message.\nWhile domain specific access control of the PS domain is ongoing, the VLR shall be configured to send paging messages on both the SGs and the A/Iu interface.\nThe VLR may apply implementation specific rules for sending the paging on the A/Iu interface. Dependent on network configuration or operator policy, if the UE does not respond to a first paging on SGs interface or the VLR considers UE fallback was failed as described in subclause 5.15.1, and A/Iu paging has not been initiated already, the VLR shall page on the A/Iu interface.",
