      "content": "For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in 3GPP TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in 3GPP TR 21.905 [1].\nAbsolute URI: Absolute URI follows generic URI syntax and consists of a hierarchical sequence of the following components: the \"scheme\", \"authority\", \"path\" and \"query\", i.e. excluding the \"fragment\" component. See clause 4.3 in IETF RFC 3986 [9].\napiRoot: apiRoot follows an absolute URI syntax, but excludes the following absolute URI identifiers: the \"query\" and \"fragment\" components. The API root contains the \"scheme\" and the \"authority\" components and may also contain an API prefix subcomponent. See clause 4.4.1. In 3GPP APIs, the default apiRoot value is \"https://example.com\" (see e.g. Annex A.2 in 3GPP TS 29.502 [20]), where \"example.com\" is replaced by the operator specific FQDN (for FQDN examples see clause 28.3.2 in 3GPP TS 23.003 [27]).\nAPI Prefix: API prefix is an optional, deployment-specific string, which is a subcomponent of the \"apiRoot\". API prefix format follows \"path-absolute\" syntax and that starts with a \"/\" reserved character (see clause 4.4.1and also clause 3.3 in IETF RFC 3986 [9]). In 3GPP APIs, the default apiRoot does not contain API Prefix (see e.g. Annex A.2 in 3GPP TS 29.502 [20]).\nAPI URI: API URI has the following format: \"{apiRoot}/<apiName>/<apiVersion>\". For more details see clause 4.4.1. As an example, for the Nudm_SDM API defined in 3GPP TS 29.503 [28], the API URI is: \"{apiRoot}/nudm-sdm/v2\".\nBase URI: Base URI is used as a reference against which the relative URI reference is applied. See clause 4.6.1.1.1.2 and also clause 5.1 in IETF RFC 3986 [9]. As an example, for the resource URI of the SM contexts collection that is defined in Nsmf_PDUSession API (see 3GPP TS 29.502 [20]), the base URI is \"{apiRoot}/nsmf-pdusession/<apiVersion>\".\nCallback URI: Callback URI follows an absolute URI syntax, but excludes the following absolute URI identifiers: \"userinfo\" subcomponent of the \"authority\" component and also the \"query\" component (\"fragment\" component is already excluded from the absolute URI). Therefore, callback URI contains the \"scheme\", \"authority\" (excluding \"userinfo\" subcomponent) and the \"path\" components. See clause 4.4.3. As an example, for the Nsmf_PDUSession API defined in 3GPP TS 29.502 [20], \"smContextStatusUri\" is one of the callback references that can be provided by the NF Service Consumer. A complete callback URI for the \"smContextStatusUri\" has the following structure https://<comsumer-host>/<consumer-path-segment>/smContextStatus, where \"consumer-host\" is either an FQDN or an IP address (see clause 4.4.3).\nRelative path after API URI: Refers to the sequence of path segments of a resource URI that are below the API URI (see the definition of the \"Paths Object\" in OpenAPI specification [4]). When appended to the API URI of the concerned API, it constitutes the resource URI. As an example, for the Nudm_SDM API defined in 3GPP TS 29.503 [28] for which the API URI is \"{apiRoot}/nudm-sdm/v2\", the \"relative path after API URI\" for the \"AccessAndMobilitySubscriptionData\" resource is: \"/{supi}/am-data\".\nRelative URI: Relative URI is deprecated and shall not be use in SBI spcificationsSee clause 1.2.3 in IETF RFC 3986 [9].\nResource URI: Resource URI identifies an abstract or a physical resource. See the Abstract of the IETF RFC 3986 [9]. In this specification this generally means \"an URI of a resource\". Resource URI structure is defined in clause 4.4.1. As an example, for the resource URI of the SM contexts collection that is defined in Nsmf_PDUSession API (see 3GPP TS 29.502 [20]), the resource URI is \"{apiRoot}/nsmf-pdusession/<apiVersion>/sm-contexts\".",

This field is removed when the OpenAPI freezes.\n1st Field (MAJOR):\n-\tThis numerical field shall be incremented when:\na)\tthere are one or more backward incompatible changes to the API after the OpenAPI freeze for a given 3GPP Release; and\nb)\tthere are the first backward incompatible change(s) to the existing API with respect to the latest version in the previous 3GPP Release while a 3GPP Release is under development (i.e. prior to the OpenAPI freeze for a given 3GPP Release).\nEXAMPLE 1:\tAssuming that 3GPP Rel-16 under development contains API version \"1.1.0-alpha.2\", and a backward incompatible change with respect to the latest version in the previous 3GPP Release is applied to that API before the OpenAPI freeze, the new Rel-16 API version is \"2.0.0-alpha.1\".\nNOTE 1:\tSubsequent changes in a given 3GPP Release under development do not lead to increment of the 1st field (MAJOR) and 2nd field (MINOR).\nNOTE 2:\tRules for determining backward incompatible changes are provided in Annex B.\nNOTE 3:\tIt is recommended to avoid backward incompatible change to the API after the OpenAPI freeze whenever possible, especially after OpenAPI freeze of a succeeding Release. It is preferable to introduce such changes only in the 3GPP Release under development.\n-\tIf a backward incompatible change needs to be applied to several 3GPP Releases the following applies:\na)\tIf the 3GPP Releases contain different MAJOR versions of the same API, a new MAJOR API version shall be assigned to each 3GPP Release in the order of those 3GPP Releases in such a manner that the lowest of those 3GPP Releases shall obtain the first unassigned MAJOR version value.\nEXAMPLE 2:\tAssuming that 3GPP Rel-15 contains API version \"1.0.0\", and Rel-16 contains API version \"2.0.0\", and that the same backward incompatible change is applied to that API in both Releases, the new Rel-15 API version is \"3.0.0\" and the new Rel-16 API version is \"4.0.0\".\nb)\tIf the 3GPP Releases contain the same MAJOR version but different MINOR versions of the same API, a single new MAJOR API version value shall be assigned for all those 3GPP Releases, unless other backward incompatible changes only applied to some of those Releases require the creation of separate MAJOR versions.\nNOTE 4:\tFor each such Release a new MINOR version is assigned.\nEXAMPLE 3:\tAssuming that 3GPP Rel-15 and Rel-16 contain API version \"1.0.0\", and Rel-17 contains API version \"1.2.0\", and that the same backward incompatible change is applied to that API in all 3GPP Releases, the new 3GPP Rel-15 and Rel-16 API version is \"2.0.0\" and the new 3GPP Rel-17 API version is \"2.2.0\".\nc)\tIf the 3GPP Releases contain the same API versions, a single new API version shall be assigned for all those 3GPP Releases, unless other changes only applied to some of those Releases require the creation of separate versions.\nEXAMPLE 4:\tAssuming that 3GPP Rel-15 and 3GPP Rel-16 contain API version \"1.0.0\", and that only the same backward incompatible change is applied to that API in both 3GPP Releases, the new 3GPP Rel-15 and Rel-16 API version is \"2.0.0\".\nEXAMPLE 5:\tAssuming that 3GPP Rel-15 and Rel-16 contain API version \"1.0.0\", and that the same backward incompatible change is applied to that API in both Releases and an additional backward compatible change is applied in 3GPP Rel-16, the new 3GPP Rel-15 API version is \"2.0.0\", and the 3GPP Rel-16 API version is \"2.1.0\".\nEXAMPLE 6:\tAssuming that 3GPP Rel-15 and Rel-16 contain API version \"1.0.0\", and that the same backward incompatible change is applied to that API in both Releases and an additional backward incompatible change is applied in 3GPP Rel-16, the new 3GPP Rel-15 API version is \"2.0.0\", and the 3GPP Rel-16 API version is \"3.0.0\".\n2nd Field (MINOR):\n-\tThis numerical field shall be incremented when:\na)\tthere are the first one or more backward compatible changes not corresponding to changes to earlier 3GPP Releases (i.e. changes introduced by 3GPP CR with other categories than \"mirror\") to the same API in a given 3GPP Release without any prior backward incompatible changes in that Release. If the same 1st field (MAJOR) and the 2nd field (MINOR) are assigned to n previous 3GPP Releases, a MINOR version number shall be reserved for each intermediate 3GPP Release for possible subsequent changes in that Release and the MINOR version number shall be incremented by n; and\nEXAMPLE 7:\tAssuming that 3GPP Rel-15 and Rel-16 contain API version \"1.0.0\" (because there were no changes to the API in Rel-16), and in Rel-17 the first backward compatible new feature is added before the OpenAPI freeze, the API version \"1.2.0-alpha.1\" is assigned to Rel-17.\nb)\tthere are one or more subsequent backward compatible additions of features not corresponding to changes to previous 3GPP Releases to the API in a frozen 3GPP Release before a higher MINOR number has been allocated for the same MAJOR version (for a subsequent Release).\n-\tThis field shall be reset to \"0\" if the 1st field (MAJOR) is changed, unless a backward incompatible change needs to be applied to several 3GPP Releases that already contain the same MAJOR but different MINOR API versions. In that case a single new major API version is assigned, and for each such 3GPP Release with an own MINOR version, a new MINOR version shall be assigned, starting with MINOR version \"0\" for the lowest such Release, and reserving a MINOR version number for each intermediate Release without an own MINOR version. (see Example 3)\nNOTE 5:\tIn most cases the MINOR version is incremented when new backward compatible features are added in a 3GPP Release. In rare cases, where only backward compatible changes not corresponding to changes to previous 3GPP Releases are applied to a 3GPP Release, the MINOR version is also incremented. It is recommended to avoid such changes in 3GPP Releases without added functionality whenever possible.\nNOTE 6:\tSubsequent backward compatible changes in a given 3GPP Release before OpenAPI freeze do not lead to an increment of the 2nd field (MINOR).\nNOTE 7:\tChanges corresponding to changes in previous 3GPP Releases do not lead to an increment of the 2nd field (MINOR).\nNOTE 8:\tIf two 3GPP Releases are under parallel development (because the work on Rel-X+1 has commenced before the OpenAPI freeze of Rel-X), the corresponding APIs will obtain distinct values of the 1st field (MAJOR) or 2nd field (MINOR).\nEXAMPLE 8:\tAssuming that an API was introduced with version \"1.0.0\" in Rel-15, and that the Rel-16 version is \"1.1.0-alpha.5\" because the OpenAPI is not yet frozen in Rel-16, and that a new backward compatible Rel-17 feature is added, the Rel-17 API version is \"1.2.0-alpha.1\".\n3rd Field (PATCH):\n-\tThis numerical field shall be incremented:\na)\tif the changes are only one or more backward-compatible corrections (but no changes requiring an update of the 1st field (MAJOR) or of the 2nd field (MINOR) are made to the API after the OpenAPI freeze of a 3GPP Release; and\nb)\tif one or more backward compatible additions of features, but no changes requiring an update of the 1st field (MAJOR) or of the 2nd field (MINOR), are made to the API after the OpenAPI freeze of a 3GPP Release and after the assignment of a MINOR version to a higher 3GPP Release.\n-\tThis field shall be reset to \"0\" if the 1st field (MAJOR) or 2nd field (MINOR) is changed.\nNOTE 9:\tBefore the OpenAPI freeze for a given 3GPP Release, the 3rd field (PATCH) will not be incremented.\nNOTE 10:\tIf the 1st field (MAJOR) and 2nd field (MINOR) were not incremented between 3GPP Releases (because there were no added features and no backward incompatible changes), and the same backward compatible changes are then applied to those 3GPP Releases, the API files in those 3GPP Releases are identical and will obtain the same API version number.\nNOTE 11:\tIn rare cases for which a new backward compatible functionality needs to be added in an older 3GPP Release after the OpenAPI freeze and work on that API already started in a later Release, the new functionality is exceptionally introduced as a PATCH correction and a new supported feature could be defined accordingly.\nThe 4th Field (NON-FROZEN and/or OPERATOR-SPECIFIC):\n-\tThe 4th Fields may or may not be present, based on the following conditions.\n-\tNON-FROZEN type. The presence of this filed type depends on the OpenAPI status, as follows:\n-\tThe 4th Field (NON-FROZEN) shall be present before the OpenAPI freeze of a 3GPP Release. An additional field (separated from the 3 first version fields by a hyphen \"-\" character) shall be supplied as follows:\na)\tWhen the 1st field (MAJOR) or 2nd field (MINOR) is incremented before the OpenAPI freeze of a 3GPP Release, this field shall obtain the value \"alpha.1\".\nb)\tThe numerical value \"n\" within the field value \"alpha.n\" shall be incremented if one or more subsequent changes (either backward incompatible, or backward compatible) are made to the given non-frozen OpenAPI.\n-\tThe 4th Field (NON-FROZEN) shall not be present after the OpenAPI freeze of a 3GPP Release., this additional field (including the hyphen \"-\" character) containing pre-release version info is removed from the API version.\n-\tOPERATOR-SPECIFIC type that represents operator-specific version field(s) . The presence of these fields depends on the OpenAPI status, and the operator preferences:\n-\tThe 4th Field (OPERATOR-SPECIFIC) shall be present after the OpenAPI freeze of a 3GPP Release. Additional fields may be supplied based on operator policy after the 3 first version fields and separated by a plus sign \"+\" character. The rules for setting, or incrementing, such fields are out of the scope of 3GPP, but they shall comply with the rules described in the Semantic Versioning Specification [17], and contain a list of dot-separated labels within the allowed character set ([0-9A-Za-z-]).\nIf no change is applied to an API in a new published TS version, the API version number shall not be incremented unless the additional field (\"-alpha.n\") needs to be removed at OpenAPI freeze. This also applies if the TS is published in a new 3GPP Release.\nNOTE 12:OpenAPI files can contain references to other OpenAPI files. Changes to referenced parts of such other OpenAPI files need to be considered when determining if and how to update an API version.\nNOTE 13:The API version number of those version fields managed by 3GPP is incremented using 3GPP change requests.",

The content of the POST request shall contain a representation of the resource to be created without a child resource identifier. For forward compatibility, the NF service producer ignores unknown attributes in the received resource representation unless specified otherwise by the particular application.\n2.\tThe NF service producer generates a child resource identifier and constructs the URI for the created resource by appending that child resource identifier to the parent resource URI received as request URI of the POST request (e.g. \"…/parent-resource/childresource1\").\nOn success, \"201 Created\" shall be returned, the content of the POST response should contain a representation of the created resource, and the \"Location\" header shall be present and shall contain the URI of the created resource. The created resource shall be served by the same NF (service) instance that received the service request, unless the 5GC SBI API specifications explicitly specified that in specific use cases the created resource may be served by another NF (service) instance. If in such specific use cases the resource is created in a different NF (service) instance, the identifier of the serving NF (service) instance shall be included in the response message.\nIf the HTTP scheme used in the returned URI is \"https\", then the authority of the URI included in the Location header shall be an FQDN, and not an IP address.\nThe URI included in the \"Location\" header may be an absolute URI or a relative URI reference (see IETF RFC 3986 [9]); when the URI is in relative form, the base URI used to resolve the URI reference is the target URI included in the received POST request.\nNOTE:\tThe representations of the resource in the request and response can differ, e.g. the representation of the resource in the response can be empty or can contain a subset of the representation as received in the request possibly with modified attributes, and in addition can contain additional attributes. Exact details will be specified by the application.\nOn failure, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error shall be returned and appropriate additional error information should be returned in the POST response body (see clause 4.8).\nA collection may be used to model a resource that serves as a directory of resources that may be distributed on different processing instances or hosts.

The query component is indicated by the first question mark (\"?\") character and terminated by a number sign (\"#\") character or by the end of the URI. Absence of the query component from the URI is indicated by absence of a question mark character from the URI. The syntax of the query component is specified in IETF RFC 3986 [9].\nWhen a server receives a request with a query component, it shall parse the query string in order to identify filters. The first question mark is used to be a separator and is not part of the query string. A query string is composed of a possibly empty series of \"key=value\" pairs (also referred to as series of query parameters), separated by \"&\". If one query parameter contains more than one value, i.e. an array of data elements, different values shall be separated by comma (\",\").\nThe behaviour of the server, when receiving an HTTP/2 method with a query parameter which is of type array and only some of the members in the array can be matched, depends on each API and the behaviour shall be clearly described.\nIf multiple query parameters are defined for a method on the resource, the logical 'AND' represents the default logical relationship between the query parameters for this resource. If a logical relationship between multiple query parameters is specified in an API, then this overrides the default relationship. If multiple query parameters are defined for a method on the resource in an API, but there is no need to specify any logical relationship between these query parameters, the API shall explicitly state this.\n4.6.1.1.5.2\tComplex query expression\nThe complex query expression is used when there are multiple query parameters in the URI and the query condition needs to be expressed by a logical combination of multiple query parameters which overrides the default logical relationship of the query parameters. The complex query expression is either a Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) or a Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) which is equivalent to the logical combination of query parameters reflecting the query condition.\nThe \"complex-query\" query parameter may be used when a complex query expression is needed to express a query condition. The value of the \"complex-query\" query parameter is of type \"ComplexQuery\" which is a JSON object, the corresponding CNF or DNF is encoded into that JSON object (see 3GPP TS 29.571 [5] for the details of the data type \"ComplexQuery\"). The use of \"complex-query\" shall be negotiated using the feature negotiation procedure as defined in 3GPP TS 29.500 [2].\nIf a query parameter is included in the \"complexQuery\" then the same query parameter shall not be included outside the \"complexQuery\" in the same request message.\nNOTE 1:\tIt is not assumed that all APIs support \"complex-query\", the API supports this feature only when it is described in the corresponding specification.\nNOTE 2:\tThe logical relationship between \"complex-query\" and the other query parameters defined for a particular API is described in the corresponding specification of that API.\nNTOE 3:\tThe \"complex-query\" is not an additional explanation of the other query parameters, the condition expressed in the \"complex-query\" is evaluated along with the other queries.",

If the expiry time is not included in the response, the NF Service Consumer shall consider the subscription to be valid without an expiry time.When \"204 No Content\" is returned, it shall be interpreted that the NF Service Producer accepted entirely the resource representation provided by the NF Service Consumer in the request; e.g., if the request contained a proposed expiry time, a 204 response shall be interpreted as if such timestamp is accepted by the NF Service Producer as the expiration time for the subscription and, similarly, if the request did not contain a proposed expiry time, a 204 response shall be interpreted as if no expiration time is set by the NF Service Producer for the subscription.\nOn failure, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error shall be returned and appropriate additional error information should be returned in the PUT response body (see clause 4.8).\nIf the NF Service Consumer is not allowed to update the subscription information, the \"403 Forbidden\" HTTP status code shall be returned and appropriate additional error information should be returned in the PUT response body (see clause 4.8).\nIf the resource that is to be updated does not exist at the NF service producer, the \"404 Not Found\" HTTP status code shall be returned.\n4.6.2.2.3.2\tModification of a Subscription Using HTTP PATCH\nProcedures that allow a NF service consumer to update subscription at the server by means of a partial replacement shall use the HTTP PATCH method (see IETF RFC 5789 [10]) to modify the current subscription according to given modification instructions.\nFigure 4.6.2.2.3.2-1 illustrates updating a resource using HTTP PATCH.\nFigure 4.6.2.2.3.2-1: Modification a subscription using HTTP PATCH\n1.\tThe NF Service Consumer shall send a PATCH request to the resource URI representing the individual subscription. The content of the PATCH request shall contain the modification instructions. The request may contain an expiry time (i.e. a future timestamp), requested by the NF Service Consumer, representing the time upto which the subscription is desired to be kept active and the time after which the subscribed event shall stop generating notifications.\n2.\tOn success, \"204 No Content\" without any response body or \"200 OK\" with a response body containing the modified subscription information shall be returned. When \"204 No Content\" is returned and if the request included an expiry time, then the requested expiry time shall be accepted by the NF Service Producer. When \"200 OK\" is returned and if the request included an expiry time then the response based on operator policies and taking into account the expiry time included in the request, shall contain an expiry time (i.e. a future timestamp), as determined by the NF Service Producer, after which the subscription becomes invalid. If an expiry time was included in the request, then the expiry time returned in the response should be less than or equal to that value. Once the subscription expires, if the NF Service Consumer wants to keep receiving notifications, it shall create a new subscription in the NF Service Producer, as specified in clause 4.6.2.2.2. The NF Service Producer shall not provide the same expiry time (i.e. a future timestamp) for many subscriptions in order to avoid all of them expiring and recreating the subscription at the same time.\nOn failure, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error shall be returned and appropriate additional error information should be returned in the PATCH response body (see clause 4.8).",

OAuth 2.0 supports the concept of scope values to signal which actual access rights an access token represents.\nEach 5GC API shall define a service-level scope set to the service name of the NF Service. This scope grants generic access to the given API, for those operations on resources that do not require a specific authorization. In addition, a 5GC API may define additional resource/operation-level scopes, that uniquely represents the type of operation (e.g. create/modify/read), the resource and the service; a resource/operation-level scope and the service-level scope, together, grant access to the operations on resources that require a specific authorization.\nThe need for defining additional resource/operation-level scopes in a 5GC API depends on the API functionalities and service operations and on the expected NF service consumers, and thus is up to the API responsible Working Group to decide. The following points may be considered when assessing the need for additional scopes:\n-\tIt should be carefully assessed during the design of the 5GC API whether different access rights to the functionalities provided by the API may be needed for different NF service consumers, e.g. considering example NF service consumers of the different service operations supported by the API.\n-\tA 5GC API defined with a service-level scope only, i.e. without additional resource/operation-level scopes, grants access permissions to all its service operations to all NF service consumers allowed to access the service. It should be ensured that designing the API in this way does not cause any vulnerability to the 5GS, e.g. by granting inappropriate read access to sensitive data to undue NF service consumers or by granting inappropriate write (or delete) access to undue NF service consumers.\n-\tAdditional scopes should be defined when it is needed to enable restricting the access to certain resource/operations of the 5GC API to specific NF service consumers. This may be the case e.g. when an API supports multiple service operations that may be invoked by different NF service consumers (possibly with different NF types or belonging to different S-NSSAIs, PLMNs or SNPNs), or when it is needed to differentiate access rights for read vs. create/modify/write operations.\n-\tThe definition of additional scopes comes with some implementation and network operation complexity. Care should be taken not to increase unreasonably the number of scopes defined in a 5GC API.\n-\tEach additional resource/operation-level scope shall be defined with a clear description (in the main body and in the OpenAPI file of the Technical Specification defining the API) of the access right the additional scope corresponds to. The naming of the resource/operation-level scopes should follow the conventions defined in clause 5.3.16 for ease of understanding and consistency across all 5GC APIs.",

      "content": "The following requirements are intended as general guidance for 3GPP Stage 3 work in order to specify secure protocols and APIs. As such, these guidelines are independent of the specific technology and shall be followed at all times.\n-\tThe valid format and range of values (when applicable) for each IE shall be defined unambiguously.\nNOTE 1:\tExplicitly defining format and range of values not only helps to improve the security of a certain implementation, but also allows for reliable interoperability between different protocol implementations. Example: Defining a \"lowercase string variable of length 10 and range [a..z]\" is much more explicit that just defining a \"string of length 10\". There are known vulnerabilities such as a denial of service (resulting in the parser converting from a string representing an integer – an attacker can pass in an arbitrarily large integer and trigger an unhandled exception) and such leading to a heap corruption and crash (proof-of-concept available), or potentially remote code execution (no proof-of-concept known). Unicode literals also require special treatment when doing string comparisons to ensure that equivalent strings return true when compared.\n-\tFor each message the number of leaf IEs shall not exceed 2048K. If a leaf IE is an array of a simple data type, then the whole array shall count as one leaf. If a leaf IE is a data structure or an array of data structures, then it shall be considered a branch, i.e. it shall not be counted as a leaf. The data structure's (branch) attributes determine the number of leaves. For instance, a data structure with e.g. three attributes will count as three leaves.\n-\tThe maximum size of the JSON body of any HTTP request/response shall not exceed 16 million octets before compression is applied, if any.\nNOTE 2:\tAPIs need to be designed taking care to avoid a too large HTTP content size for performance reasons.\n-\tThe maximum nesting depth of leaves shall not exceed 32. If a leaf IE is an array of a simple data type, then the whole array shall be considered as the first level of nesting. If a leaf IE is a data structure or an array of data structures, then it shall be considered a branch and the first level of nesting. The data structure's attributes (leaves) shall be considered as the second level of nesting. For instance, a data structure with e.g. one attribute-A, which is also a data structure with e.g. one attribute-B, then attribute-B will make the third level of nesting.\nNOTE 3:\tThere are resource exhaustion attacks on JSON parsers. Defined maximum numbers of IEs, sizes and nesting depths allow implementations to know an upper bound of required resources. It also allows validation of incoming messages. Recursively processing nested objects leads to stack exhaustion and a denial of service bug.\n-\tFor data structures where values are accessible using names (sometimes referred to as keys), e.g. a JSON object, the name shall be unique. The occurrence of the same name (or key) twice within such a structure shall be an error and the message shall be rejected.\nNOTE 4:\tSerialization schemes (e.g. JSON) can leave the handling of repeated names (keys) up to the implementer's discretion. For example, for a repeated name an error can be raised, the pair can be ignored, or the first or last value read can be used, though there is no canonical order in which a parser should treat the data it receives. Failure to adhere to consistent handling rules can lead to vulnerabilities. From a security perspective rejecting objects with repeated names, rather than accepting according to some rule, is the more robust solution, and aids in identification of potentially malicious activity. There are known attacks with specially crafted malicious messages that are designed to confuse implementations of NFs to get fraudulent messages into a PLMN.",

Therefore, each OpenAPI specifications shall contain all necessary information to correctly and unambiguously parse the contents of the message body.\nNOTE:\tAttacks often exploit corner cases and unspecified behavior in order to exploit a system. Traffic normalization counters this by either dropping traffic that is malformed or by forcing certain information elements to a \"normal\" value. Typically, this relates to inconsistent fields.\n-\t3GPP TS 33.501 [22] documents which type of information shall be confidentiality protected on the N32 interface. The fields where these types of information (e.g. SUPI) is contained may have different names. Even if the field names are different, the mechanism specified in clause 5.2.3.3 of 3GPP TS 29.573 [24] shall clearly identify the type of information carried in each IE and which information types shall be confidentiality protected.\nAnnex A (informative):TS Skeleton Template\nA TS Skeleton Template to be used as a starting point of drafting a 5G System SBI Stage 3 specification is available at the following location:\nhttps://www.3gpp.org/ftp/information/All_Templates/29.xxx-SBI-Stage3-Template.zip\nAnnex B (informative):Backward Incompatible Changes\nThis Annex provides information about the changes in the API that are considered as backwards compatible and those that are considered as backwards incompatible. This list is to be considered informative and it may be expanded in future releases, when necessary.\nBackward compatible changes are additions or changes in the API that do not break the existing Service Consumer behaviour. Examples of backward compatible changes include:\n-\tAdding a new, optional child resource/URI;\n-\tSupporting a new HTTP method;\n-\tAdding new elements to a resource representation;\n-\tChanging the order of fields in a resource representation;\n-\tAddition of a new status code:\nNOTE 1:\tWhen a NF / NF Service receives a HTTP status code that it cannot recognize it will treat it as the corresponding x00 status code as specified in clause 5.2.7.3 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [2].\n-\tCorrections of obvious errors in an OpenAPI file required to enable a correct parsing of the file such as misspelled references;\n-\tCorrections that only relate to smaller and optional parts of the functionality (e.g. a supported feature, see 3GPP TS 29.500 [2] clause 6.6.2), even if the changes are backward incompatible with respect to that part of the functionality; and\nNOTE 2:\tIt is recommended to only apply corrections which are also backward compatible with respect to such smaller and optional parts of the functionality. If this is not possible a new supported feature can be introduced to enable a negotiation of the support of the correction, and the old corresponding supported feature can be marked as \"withdrawn\" in the table defining the supported features of an API.\n-\tBackward-compatible changes related to the semantics (i.e. functional behaviour) specified for an API.\nChanges in the API that do not result in any loss of existing functionality (i.e. functionality that works fine if both consumer and provider do not support the change) if only consumer or only provider implements the change can be considered as backwards compatible corrections or additions.\nBackward incompatible changes are additions or changes in the API that break the existing Service Consumer behaviour. Here is a list of backward incompatible changes that shall require incrementing the 1st field (MAJOR) of the API version number unless they only relate to smaller and optional parts of the functionality (see above):\n-\tRemoving a resource/URI:\n-\tRemoving support for an HTTP method;\n-\tRenaming a field in a resource representation;\n-\tAdding mandatory parameters to a resource URI or resource representation;\n-\tAttribute data type changes;\n-\tCardinality changes (NOTE 3); and\nNOTE 3:\tWhether attribute cardinality changes are backward compatible depend on the type of change. Examples of non-backward compatibility changes include decreasing the upper bound of a cardinality range for attributes sent by the NF service consumer, changing the meaning of the default behavior associated to the absence of an attribute of cardinality 0..N, etc.\n-\tBackward incompatible changes related to the semantics (i.e. functional behaviour) specified for an API.\nChanges in the API that result in loss of existing functionality (i.e. functionality that works fine if both consumer and provider do not support the change) if only consumer or only provider implements the change can be considered as backwards incompatible modifications.\nWhen a change although being categorised as backwards compatible correction or addition results in interoperability issues, it is expected that the issue will be resolved by implementing the change at both consumer and provider.\nAnnex C (Informative):Resource modelling\nC.0\tGeneral\nWhen designing an API, one shall first think of defining the set of resources consumed. Resources represent objects that are modified by standard HTTP methods and that can be modelled with one of 4 archetypes detailed below. Resource archetypes help API designers to structure the resources. In this process the designer should refer to the appropriate archetype when the resource definition perfectly matches the archetype one. Referring to an archetype immediately defines what operations and HTTP methods are supported by the resource.\nThe archetypes provided hereafter don't preclude the existence of resources of different types.\nC.1\tDocument\nThe document archetype is the conceptual base archetype of the other ones. Any resource that is not identified with one of the other resource archetypes is a document.\nA document may have child resources that represent its specific subordinate concepts.\nThe archetype does not place any restriction on HTTP methods when acting on a document.\nOnly CRUD operations are performed directly on a document resource, i.e. by sending an HTTP request to the URI of that resource. Custom methods are not performed directly on the resource, but by sending an HTTP request to a URI that is associated by a convention with the URI of the resource.\nC.2\tCollection\nThe collection archetype can be used to model a resource that serves as a directory of resources. A collection is NF Service Provider-managed so the NF Service Provider decides the URIs of each resource that is created in the collection.\nNOTE:\tEven though a collection resource typically contains child resources, it is allowed that a particular collection resource does not contain any child resource at a particular point in time (\"empty collection\").\nThe Create and Read operations are performed on a collection directly.\nMore specifically:\n-\tA collection child resource is created by sending a POST with the collection URI if accepted by the collection;\n-\tA collection is read by sending a GET with the collection URI;\n-\tThe PUT and PATCH methods with the collection URI are not allowed;\n-\tThe DELETE method with the collection URI is only allowed if the collection resource has been created dynamically based on a request from the NF Service Consumer.\n-\tThe authorized operations on a collection child resource depend on that resource's archetype.\nC.3\tStore\nThe store archetype can also be used to model a resource that serves as a directory of resources but a store is NF Service Consumer-managed. The NF Service Consumer solely decides what resource shall be added to / deleted from a store. The NF Service Consumer decides what the URI of the added resource is.\nNOTE:\tEven though a store resource typically contains child resources, it is allowed that a particular store resource does not contain any child resource at a particular point in time (\"empty store\").\nThe Read operation is performed on a store directly, and the Create operation is performed on store child resources.\nMore specifically:\n-\tA store child resource is created by sending a PUT with the URI of the child resource to be created.\n-\tA store is read by sending a GET with the store URI;\n-\tThe POST, PUT and PATCH methods with the store URI are not allowed;\n-\tThe DELETE method with the store URI is only allowed if the store resource has been created dynamically based on a request from the NF Service Consumer.\n-\tApart from Create (PUT), the authorized operations on a store child resource depend on that resource's archetype.\nC.4\tCustom operation\nThe custom operation archetype can be used to model an unsafe and non-idempotent operation that is not a Create on a collection.\nA custom operation does not operate directly on the resource that would be identified by the custom operation URI. Instead, when the custom operation is associated with a resource, the operation is performed on this associated resource. For instance, a custom operation may modify the associated resource in a special way. This associated resource is identified by stripping the suffix string \"/<custOpName>\" from the custom operation URI template in clause 4.4.2.\nWhen the custom operation is not associated with any resource but with the service, it acts as an executable function with input parameters and returns the result of the executed function in the response body, not modifying any resource.\nPOST is the only method allowed with a custom operation URI.\nThe semantic of the custom operation is encoded in the last segment of the URI template in clause 4.4.2: /{custOpName}.\nAnnex D (informative):Example of an OpenAPI specification file for Patch\nAs described in clause 4.6.1.1.3.2, the bodies of HTTP PATCH requests will either use a \"JSON Merge Patch\" encoding as defined in IETF RFC 7396 [7], a \"JSON Patch\" encoding as defined IETF RFC 6902 [8], or an HTTP multipart message with the multipart/mixed content-type as described in IETF RFC 2046 [29]. This annex provides an example OpenAPI Specification [4] allowing both encodings.\nNOTE:\tBoth encoding possibilities are shown in this example for illustrative purposes. However, only a single of the above encodings will be specified for each resource where the PATCH method is supported unless backward compatibility considerations necessitate the support of both encodings.\nopenapi: 3.0.0\ninfo:\nversion: \"1.0.0\"\ntitle: PATCH Example\npaths:\n/inventory:\npost:\nsummary: adds an inventory item\noperationId: addInventory\ndescription: Adds an item to the system\nresponses:\n'201':\ndescription: item created\n'400':\ndescription: 'invalid input, object invalid'\n'409':\ndescription: an existing item already exists\nrequestBody:\ncontent:\napplication/json:\nschema:\n$ref: '#/components/schemas/InventoryItem'\ndescription: Inventory item to add\n/inventory/{id}:\nget:\nsummary: read inventory item\nparameters:\n- name: id\nin: path\nrequired: true\nschema:\ntype: integer\nresponses:\n'200':\ndescription: search results matching criteria\ncontent:\napplication/json:\nschema:\n$ref: '#/components/schemas/InventoryItem'\n'400':\ndescription: bad input parameter\npatch:\nsummary: patch inventory item\nparameters:\n- name: id\nin: path\nrequired: true\nschema:\ntype: integer\nrequestBody:\nrequired: true\ncontent:\napplication/json-patch+json:\nschema:\n$ref: '#/components/schemas/PatchInventoryItem'\napplication/merge-patch+json:\nschema:\n$ref: '#/components/schemas/MergePatchInventoryItem'\nmultipart/mixed:\nschema:\n$ref: '#/components/schemas/MultipartPatch'\nencoding:\npatch: #

One of these structures is the \"array\", representing a set of ordered values.\nIt should be noted that, while JSON allows that the value of the elements of an array may be of different types, in OpenAPI Specification [4]this is further restricted, and all elements of an array shall be of the same type.\nAlso, it is important to note that the JSON format itself, as specified in IETF RFC 8259 [3], does not define any syntax to refer to specific array elements.\nHowever, there are certain conventions to specify mechanism to refer to array elements, e.g. based on the position a given element has in the array.\nIn particular, the JSON Pointer syntax defines a string syntax for identifying a specific value within a JSON document. This syntax consists of a number of tokens separated by the \"/\" character; in order to refer to a specific element in an array, then token shall contain an unsigned decimal value, indicating the zero-based index of the element in the array.\nEXAMPLE:\nJSON document:\n{\n\"attr1\": 0,\n\"attr2\": true,\n\"attr3\": [ 1, 2, 3 ]\n}\nJSON Pointer expression \"/attr3/0\" evaluated on such JSON document: 1\nThere are several scenarios, frequently employed in the 5GC APIs, that make use of the JSON Pointer mechanism to refer to specific elements in an array:\n-\tUpdate of resources using the PATCH method, as described in clause 4.6.1.1.3.2. If the syntax used in the PATCH request payload is based on the \"JSON Patch\" format, then the JSON Pointer mechanism is used to specify patch operations applied to specific array elements.\n-\tNotifications of events (such as data changes), as described in clause 4.6.2.3, using as notification payload the notation defined in \"NotifyItem\" / \"ChangeItem\" data types defined in 3GPP TS 29.571 [5]. This notation is similar to \"JSON Patch\", so it also makes use of the JSON Pointer syntax to refer to specific array elements.\n-\tExplicit usage of attributes containing JSON Pointer expressions in request or response payloads.\nIn these scenarios, it is critical that any JSON Pointer expression is applied by both client and server on the exact same array representation, since otherwise the indexes may vary, and the JSON Pointer will give unexpected results.\nA typical scenario that may create issues could be as follows:\n1.\tNF Service Consumer sends a first GET request towards a NF Service Producer, including certain query parameters in the HTTP request, that result into retrieving a resource representation that contains a subset of the data that the NF Service Producer holds under such resource. When such subset refers to returning just some of the elements of an array, rather than the entire array, then the content of the array will differ between consumer and producer.\n2a.\tThe NF Service Consumer sends a subsequent PATCH request towards the NF Service Producer, with the intention to modify a given element of the array (specified by the array index, per the JSON Pointer syntax). This results into the server modifying a wrong element in the array, given that the NF Service Producer contains a different array.\n2b.\tThe NF Service Consumer may subscribe to be notified by the NF Service Producer when a given resource representation has changed. When the NF Service Producer detects such a change, it sends a notification that may include a reference to an array index, which may be different than the array index kept by the NF Service Producer.\n2c. The NF Service Consumer is a stateless NF Service Consumer that has no local representation of the array that subscribes to be notified by the NF Service Producer when a given resource representation has changed.\nAnother scenario that may lead to incorrect array updates is:\n1.\tTwo different NF Service Consumer sends a GET request towards a NF Service Producer to retrieve the representation of a certain resource.\n2.\tA first NF Service Consumer NF1 sends a PATCH request towards the NF Service Producer, with the intention to delete a given element of the array (specified by the array index, per the JSON Pointer syntax). This results in some of the array indexes being changed (of those elements placed after the deleted element)\n3.\tA second NF Service Consumer NF2, sends another PATCH request towards the NF Service Producer, to modify any of the elements of the array whose index was affected by the previous operation done by NF1. This results in modifying unintendedly the wrong array element.\nThe design of 5GC SBI APIs should take into account these scenarios and provide mechanisms to avoid unintended modifications of array elements, when they are referred by their position index in the array.\nTo achieve these, both NF Service Consumer and Producer (taking the role of HTTP client and server) should ensure that any resource update takes place on a known and current resource representation, based on the content of ETag values sent along with resource representations by the resource owner.\nIf an NF Service Consumer needs to cache a resource representation received from an NF Service Producer (i.e. the JSON information received in an HTTP response message), it shall use the exact same representation of arrays as received from the service producer.\nWhen sending notifications or modifications whose semantics is based on the JSON Pointer syntax, the sending NF shall use the exact same representation of arrays as previously signalled in a previous interaction with the receiver of such notifications/modifications.Further, when sending notifications whose semantics is based on the JSON Pointer syntax, if the NF Service Consumer is a stateless NF Service Consumer and thus has no local representation of the array, the NF Producer shall use the complete replacement array representation as the NF Service Consumer is otherwise required to request the complete data from the NF Service Producer with a GET request.\nAnnex F (informative):Change history\nChange
