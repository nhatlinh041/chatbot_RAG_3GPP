The MC Services provides a real-time priority and QoS experience for the MC users, who have significant dynamic operational requirements that determine their priority.

The details on how the priority level is evaluated and used is outside the scope of this specification. What is specified is the necessary mechanisms to apply the priority and QoS and map different priority parameters between different entities, for example to map application layer priority to transport layer priority.\nOne of the requirements for MC communication services is to coordinate the use of priority levels between the different MC service servers.

Certain application functions of MCPTT service such as dispatch and administrative functions can be supported using either MCPTT UEs in E-UTRAN, using MCPTT UEs in 5GS or using MCPTT UEs via non-3GPP access networks.\nNOTE:\tDispatch consoles and devices used by MCPTT service administrators are considered MCPTT UEs in the MCPTT architecture.\nMCPTT UEs that use non-3GPP access can only support a subset of the functionality specified in this specification that is supported by the non-3GPP access network.\nThe MCPTT system provides the function to support interworking with LMR systems defined in 3GPP TS 23.283 [20].\n4.6.X\tProposed change to <Y> <Title>\nEditor's note: Proposed modification to cover both 4G and 5GS, using highlighting, hard-strikeout of removed text and hard-underlining for new text.",

It must be ensured that Mission Critical organisation´s control rooms have access to the MC System when the 5GS technology is applied. Mission critical networks and the control room (as the steering and managing part of it) have to be failsafe and always be accessible. To reach these goals the most preferred interfacing method for control rooms to mobile networks is based on a wired connection beside wireless access which is mainly used in special scenarios or in absence of fixed line infrastructure. A standardised interface is required between the MC systems running on 5GS and the control room´s access networks.\nBesides access via air interface, the IP-based wireline access protects not only the dispatchers in case of an air interface failure, but also the users under the supervision of a dispatcher or multiple dispatchers behind a concentration point.\nEditor's Note:\tThe exact gaps need to be further analysed.",

      "section_title": "EPS versus 5GS QoS model",
      "content": "There are differnces in the QoS model between 4G EPS and 5GS. While the EPS followed a rather rigid approach, 5GS uses a more flexible approach of multiple different QoS flows within a PDU session as outlined in the figure 6.1.1.3‑1.\nFigure 6.1.1.3-1 Differences between EPS and 5GS QoS model\nAn EPS bearer (3GPP TS 23.401) is the level of granularity for bearer level QoS control in the EPC/E-UTRAN. That is, all traffic is mapped to the same EPS bearer that receive the same bearer level packet forwarding treatment (e.g. scheduling policy, queue management policy, rate shaping policy, RLC configuration, etc.). Hence different bearer level packet forwarding treatments require separate EPS bearers linked to the corresponding APNs associated with a certain QoS profiles.\nWhile an EPS Bearer with the priority, latency as well as packet error ratio is firmly linked to the bearer, the QoS parameters migrate in the 5G QoS model into individual flows which are detached from a bearer QoS. The 5G QoS model (3GPP TS 23.501) is based on QoS flows that require guaranteed flow rate (GBR QoS Flows) and QoS flows that do not require guaranteed flow rate (Non-GBR QoS Flows). The QoS Flow is the finest granularity of QoS differentiation and uses the QoS Flow ID (QFI) to identify a QoS flow in the 5G System. User Plane traffic with the same QFI within a PDU Session receives the same traffic forwarding treatment (e.g. scheduling, admission threshold). An QFI is used for all PDU Session types and is unique within a PDU Session. The QFI may be dynamically assigned or may be equal to a 5G QoS identifier (5QI). Within the 5GS, a QoS flow associated with the default QoS rule is required to be established for a PDU Session and remains established throughout the lifetime of the PDU Session. It can be concluded that each individual data packet within the QoS flow can be provided with the QoS attributes. Hence, a QoS flow is associated with QoS requirements (QoS Profile) as defined by QoS parameters and QoS characteristics.\nThe parameter Allocation Retention Priority (ARP) contains information about the priority level, the pre-emption capability and the pre-emption vulnerability. The ARP priority level defines the relative importance of a resource request and is independent to the priorities associated with the QCIs/QIs. This allows deciding whether a bearer/flow establishment or modification request can be accepted or needs to be rejected in case of resource limitations (typically used for admission control of GBR traffic). It can also be used to decide which existing bearers/flows are pre-empted during transport resource limitations. The main difference between the use of ARP in the EPS and 5GS case is that in EPS the ARP is available for the bearer and thus applies to all users of the same bearer at the same time. In the case of the 5GS, ARP can be used differently for each QFI and is therefore user-specific and no longer bearer-specific.\nTable 6.1.1.3-1 below compares the standardised QCI characteristics (3GPP TS 23.203 [9]) applicable within the EPS and the standardised QI characteristics (3GPP TS 23.501 [10]) applicable for the 5GS. This consideration is limited to the common signaling referenced by 3GPP TS 23.280 [2] and QCIs/QIs explicitely used for MC services.\nTable 6.1.1.3-1 Comparison EPS QCI values versus 5GS 5QI values\nEPS QCI value\nEPS Resource Type\nEPS\nPriority Level\nEPS Packet Delay Budget\nEPS Packet Error Loss Rate\n5GS 5QI value\n5GS Resource Type\n5GS Default Priority Level\n5GS Packet Delay Budget\n5GS Packet Error Rate\n65\nGBR\n0.7\n75 ms\n10-2\n65\nGBR\n7\n75 ms\n10-2\n66\nGBR\n2\n100 ms\n10-2\n66\nGBR\n20\n100 ms\n10-2\n67\nGBR\n1.5\n100 ms\n10-3\n67\nGBR\n15\n100 ms\n10-3\n5\nNon-GBR\n1\n100 ms\n10-6\n5\nNon-GBR\n10\n100 ms\n10-6\n8\nNon-GBR\n8\n300 ms\n10-6\n8\nNon-GBR\n80\n300 ms\n10-6\n69\nNon-GBR\n0.5\n60 ms\n10-6\n69\nNon-GBR\n5\n60 ms\n10-6\n70\nNon-GBR\n5.5\n200 ms\n10-6\n70\nNon-GBR\n55\n200 ms\n10-6\nFrom table 6.1.1.3-1 it can be seen that the QCI and its characteristics were transferred one to one according to 5GS 5QI, with the exception that only integer values were used for the priority level.

The associated elimination of the rather strict bearer to QoS profile approach would allow the use of a single DNN in the MC service context.\nFor the backward compatibility from 5GS to EPS, the present APN approach according to 3GPP TS 23.280 need to be maintained. For an 5GS only environment, without considering the EPS backward compatibility, the number of DNNs could be reduced. In addition, 3GPP TS 23.401 and also 3GPP TS 23.501 pursue the same approaches related to the PDU session type, e.g. IPv4 or IPv6.\n-\tFunctional Model\nDue to the adapted 5GS interaction between AF and PCF via the reference point N5, an adjustment is proposed in the functional model for application plane and signalling plane in 3GPP TS 23.280.\n-\tQCI/QI values\nThe individual values for latency, packet reliability etc. of the 5G QI definitions for MC services correspond to those of the EPS QCI definitions, with the exception that the priorities are only noted as integer values. To avoid possible overlaps between the application of QCI and 5G QI, dedicated chapters for the EPS and 5GS in 3GPP TS 23.280 are assumed.\n-\tSecondary authentication\nSecondary authentication may be required using DN-AAA server (3GPP TS 23.501) using EAP according to 3GPP TS 33.501.",

One network slice and its S-NSSAI corresponds to one PDU session. A DNN allows to establish up to 8 PDU sessions.

Thus, the change between media distribution anchors is always controlled by the same MC server signalling/application plane anchor. This approach does not require a new assignment of the IP address, so it does not trigger SIP re-registration with the MC service server anchor to keep the signalling/application plane.

In this context, Session and Service Continuity modes (3GPP TS 23.501) regulate IP continuity and the resulting media plane interruption.\nFigure 6.5.1.4-1 visualizes the use of 5GS with one central and several local UPFs. The change of the UPF due to mobility will be handled by the 5GC session management which allows preservation of IP Addresses (3GPP TS 23.501) used by the media plane. As a result, the path of the media plane through the 3GPP network will not be affected by the mobility.\nFigure 6.5.1.4-1: Media distribution function as remote peripheral unit with 5GS\nThe different service and session continuity modes have an impact to the service continuity in the media plane distribution.

The AF may select between the modes broadcast multicast and unicast, while 5GC determines the use of Shared or Individual Delivery and NR-RAN determines if PTP or PTM is used for Shared Delivery. Functional elements, such as mobility or localized areas, can only be found in 5GS with the corresponding functional extensions.\nThe subclause deals with the necessary adjustments for the MC service functional models. This present solution illustrates the simplified the MC service functional models using 5G MBS and specifies the necessary 5G MBS functional blocks for MC services.\nNOTE 1: The solution architecture requires continuous alignment with the corresponding aspects in 3GPP TS 23.247.\nThe figure 6.8.1-1 illustrates an MC service functional model for 5G MBS, based on transport-only mode with no LTE interworking.\nFigure 6.8.1-1 MC service functional model application plane using 5G MBS reference point representation\nMC service media content and corresponding control messages can be exchanged using MBS session and their corresponding MBS QoS flow(s), which are communication pipes with one end in the 5G Core and the other end in the MC service UE. The media content uses N6mb reference point towards corresponding media functions in the 5G Core (i.e., with MB-UPF). For the corresponding signalling in case of untrusted operations of the MC services N33 reference point is applicable for interaction with the 5GC via NEF/MBSF. In case of trusted operations, the MC service server interacts directly via Nmb13 reference point towards MB-SMF. In case of having dynamic PCC rule based MBS sessions, the MC service server interacts with PCF either indirectly via N33 towards NEF/MBSF, or directly via N5 reference point.\nThe figure 6.8.1-2 illustrates an MC service functional model for 5G MBS, based on transport-only mode and once interworking with LTE is facilitated via MBSF and MBSTF.\nFigure 6.8.1-2 MC service functional model application plane using 5G MBS reference point representation with MBSF/MBSTF.\nFigure 6.8.1-2 provides the reference points when the deployment includes MBSF and MBSTF for interworking purposes with LTE within the transport only mode. The media content uses Nmb8/MB2-U reference point towards the 5GC (MBSTF). For the corresponding signalling, either N33 reference point is applicable for untrusted MC services operation towards NEF (or towards collaboration of NEF and MBSF deployment case) or Nmb10 is applicable towards MBSF for trusted operation.\nEditor's note: The use of MBS for MC services within the full-service mode via MBSF/MBSTF, is FFS as it depends on the work progress done by SA4.\nThe uplink is always allocated as unicast transport resource, while the downlink can be allocated as unicast transport resource for individual delivery, as MBS transport resource for shared delivery or a combination of both if multiple cells are involved.\nThe TMGI is still the core element to identify uniquely the MBS session. Elements that are closely connected to the transport within the 5GS are only managed there and are no longer used at the application level.\nA 5G multicast/broadcast MBS session is uniquely identified via the MBS session ID (i.e. a TMGI or source specific IP multicast address).\nThe MC service server has to consider TMGI to enable session binding with the corresponding PCF. The necessary binding of appropriate QoS flow for an MBS session will be within 5GS MBS.\nThe MC service server needs to consider the following functions to enable the group communication over 5G MBS:\n-\tMode determination: Whether to use Multicast, Broadcast, or/and unicast of each group call\n-\tinterfacing the NEF to request the corresponding MBS service information/QoS requirements if dynamic PCC is applicable\n-\tinterfacing with the NEF to use the TMGI for the corresponding 5G MBS session, and to allocate the appropriate mode (multicast/broadcast)\n-\tannouncing the MBS service information to MC service UEs involved in the group communication\n-\tannouncing the assignment of MBS session for a specific group call to involved MC service UEs\n-\tsignalling with MC service UE for receiving the broadcast MBS session reception report and the multicast MBS session status report\n-\tinterfacing with the MB-SMF/NEF for local MBS session configuration and inform the MC service UE about the local MBS session information\nThe update to existing functional models for MCPTT to support 5G MBS based on transport only mode is shown in figure 6.8.1-3.\nFigure 6.8.1-3 MCPTT functional model for application plane supporting 5G MBS\nThe following reference point descriptions are applied:\nReference point MCPTT-5 (between the MCPTT server and the 5GS)\nThe MCPTT-5 reference point, which exists between the MCPTT server and the 5GS, is used, subject to the conditions below, by the MCPTT server to establish an MBS session obtaining a unicast network resource with appropriate QoS from the 5GS. It utilises N5reference point, or the Rx reference point, or N33 reference point of 5GS according to 3GPP TS 23.247 [19].\nMCPTT-5, utilizing Nmb13 reference point, may be used when the MCPTT service provider and the PLMN operator have an operational agreement where QoS control is provided directly from the MCPTT service provider domain.\nMCPTT-5, utilizing N33 reference point, may be used when the MCPTT service provider is limited by the operational agreement, i.e., indirect interaction with operator's 5GS network functions for QoS control.\nMCPTT-5 is also used by the MCPTT server to configure the QoS requirements in correspondence to the MBS session identifier if dynamic PCC is applicable.\nNOTE 2:\tAny coordination between the P-CSCF use of N30/N29mb and the MCPTT server use of N30/N29mb (via MCPTT-5) from the MCPTT service provider domain is not specified in this release of this specification.\nReference point MCPTT-6 (between the MCPTT server and the 5GS)\nThe MCPTT-6 reference point, which exists between the MCPTT server and the 5GS, is used to create an MBS session obtaining multicast or broadcast resources for MCPTT application usage.

When the MC service obtains 5GS transport capability, the MCPTT-8 reference point uses the N6mb reference point according to 3GPP TS 23.247[19].\nThe MCPTT-8 reference point definition in 3GPP TS 23.379 [3] is applied. When the MC service obtains 5GS full-service capability, the MCPTT-8 reference point uses the Nmb8 reference point according to 3GPP TS 23.247[19].\nThe MCPTT-8 reference point definition in 3GPP TS 23.379 [3] is applied. When the MC service provides interworking with LTE via MBSF/MBSTF, the MCPTT-8 reference point uses the MB2-U reference point according to 3GPP TS 23.247[19].\nReference point MCPTT-9 (between the floor control server and the floor participant)\nThe MCPTT-9 reference point definition in 3GPP TS 23.379 [3] is applied.

      "content": "This solution addresses key issue #13 and is intended to provide a high-level description of the general use of 5G MBS services for MC service group communications.\nAs being specified in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19], the 5G MBS services rely on the establishment of MBS sessions to deliver data in downlink as a point-to-multipoint service from an application source to multiple end users. MBS sessions consist of one or multiple MBS QoS flows addressing different service requirements.\nMBS sessions can be of two types: broadcast and multicast sessions. With broadcast MBS sessions, the data is simultaneously distributed over the radio interface to all users (UEs) located within a geographical area, i.e. a configured broadcast coverage area. With multicast MBS sessions, the data is simultaneously distributed to a dedicated set of users (UEs) over the radio interface either by a point-to-point (PTP) delivery method or a point-to-multipoint (PTM) delivery method.\nFor the support of MC service group communications using MBS sessions, a set of procedures needs to be considered and executed as shown in figure 6.9.1.1-1.\nFigure 6.9.1-1: General MBS sessions related procedures\nIn general, when the MC service server decides to use MBS sessions for MC service group communications, the MC service server is first required to configure with the 5GC one or more MBS sessions to deliver the data associated to the MC service group communications. The creation request includes, among other aspects, the MBS session type and required service requirements associated to the MBS session.\nNOTE 1:\tIt is implementation specific whether the MC service server decides to use MBS sessions, either multicast or broadcast sessions, for MC service group communications.\nAs part of the MBS session creation, specific MBS information like MBS session ID and how the data can be provided to be distributed over the MBS session is defined and available at the MC service server. An MBS session is initially configured once the MC service server triggers a request towards the 5GC, where the creation can either be performed with PCC via PCF or without PCC, as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19]. Furthermore, during the MBS session creation step, unless the MB-SMF information is available, e.g., locally configured in the MC service server or NEF/MBSF, the MC service server (directly or via NEF/MBSF) performs an MBS-SMF discovery and selection towards the 5GS as defined in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19]. For this purpose, the MC service server utilizes the MBS session related information, among others, e.g., S-NSSAI(s), DNS(s), and the MBS service area.\nBased on the MBS session related information considered during the MBS session creation, the MC service server can announce the corresponding MBS session(s) to the target MC users via an MBS service announcement. As being defined in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19], the MBS service announcement shall include, among others, the MBS session ID, session type, SDP information, and any other information required to enable that MC service UEs can receive MC service data over an specific MBS session.\nBased on the session type received in the MBS service announcement, the MC service UEs will be required to execute subsequent procedures to enable receiving the corresponding MC service data over the MBS session. For the case of multicast MBS sessions, MC service UEs will be required to request to the 5G system a session join to the corresponding multicast MBS session(s). Upon the acceptance of the first requested UE session join, the corresponding session is established. For the case of broadcast MBS sessions, session establishment occurs by a session start, which is triggered by the MC service server. Consequently, the MC service UEs will be required to start monitoring broadcast transmissions associated to the corresponding broadcast MBS session(s).\nWhen the MC service server identifies that the target MC service users can receive data over the MBS sessions, e.g. based on a notification from MC service clients indicating the successful join of a multicast MBS session or the successful monitoring of a broadcast MBS session (similar to the listening status report used in MBMS), the MC service server can decide to transmit the data (e.g. application control signalling or media associated to an MC service group communication) over the established MBS session(s).\nBefore providing MC service data to be distributed over an MBS session, the MC service server is required to indicate to the target MC service clients, either over the MBS service announcement or additional signalling, specific information related to how the specific MC service group communication is transmitted over the MBS session. For instance, this information should indicate the associated media stream used for the specific MC service group communication within the MBS session.\nFor the case of multicast MBS sessions, the MC service server can decide to stop using a multicast MBS session for MC service group communications. For that, the MC service server can request the specific MC service UE(s) to leave the corresponding multicast MBS session(s) which leads to the MC service UE sending a UE session leave request to the 5GS.\nWhen the MC service server decides to fully stop using a configured MBS session in the 5GS, the MC service server shall send a release request to the 5GC to release all resources associated to the corresponding MBS session.\nThe MC service server shall also indicate to the corresponding MC service users that the MBS session will not be used anymore for the configured MC service group communications. This will trigger, e.g., that MC service UEs stop monitoring a session in case of broadcast MBS sessions or that MC service UEs request leaving the session in the case of multicast MBS sessions and send a delete request to the 5GC to delete the MBS session.\nNOTE 2: It is implementation specific how the MC service server decides to stop using a specific MBS session for a group communication, both in case of broadcast and multicast MBS sessions.\nEditor's note: The set of procedures described in figure 6.9.1.1-1 and in general how to use them for MC service group communications are still FFS based on the further specification of these procedures in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19].",

      "content": "When the MC service server decides to use MBS sessions for MC service group communications, the MC service server is first required to configure with the 5GC one or more MBS sessions to deliver the data associated to the MC service group communications. As being specified in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19], the MBS session configuration request includes the MBS session type and required service requirements associated to the MBS session. Among other aspects, the MBS session configuration request may also include MBS service area information, which can be Cell ID list, TAI list or geographical area information.\nNOTE 1:\tIt is implementation specific whether the MC service server decides to use multicast or broadcast MBS sessions for MC service group communications.\nUnless the MB-SMF information is already available at the MC service server, e.g., it is locally configured, the MC service server (directly or via NEF/MBSF) performs an MB-SMF discovery and selection. This can be done by requesting this information towards the 5GS during a session configuration phase, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19]. For this purpose, MBS broadcast or multicast session related information, among others, e.g., S-NSSAI(s) and DNN(s) are utilized during an MB-SMF discovery.\nMoreover, the MC service can decide to configure one MBS session per MC service group. In principle, an MBS session should be sufficient to handle all MC service group communications related to the corresponding MC service group, where different service requirements can be addressed by different MBS QoS flows within the MBS session. For instance, if different required QoS requirements are considered for application level control messages, e.g. floor control messages, and media for an MCPTT group call, a QoS flow can be configured for the application level control messages and another QoS flow for the media.\nHowever, for the case of multicast MBS sessions, the MC service server could also decide to configure more than one MBS session per MC service group to deliver the same MC service data. This can avoid creating a one-to-one mapping between the members of an MC service group and the dedicated set of UEs associated to a multicast MBS session. Hence, the MC service server can hide any sensitive MC service group configuration from the 5GC.\nNOTE 2:\tIt is implementation specific whether the MC service server decides to configure one or multiple MBS sessions to transmit the MC service data associated to an MC service group.\nAs in eMBMS, the MC service server could also decide to not permanently associated an MBS session to a specific MC service group or MC service group communication. This could particularly be applicable for broadcast MBS sessions where all MC service UEs within a broadcast service area may be able to receive the same broadcasted data. However, for the case of multicast MBS sessions where the same data is only distributed to a specific set of users, the MC service server should, therefore, configure an MBS session per MC service group. In the case of co-existence of eMBMS and 5G MBS , MC service server may also trigger the eMBMS bearer establishment to the underlying network entity (NEF, or BMSC, or joint entity of BMSC and MBSF) based on the RAT capabilities information of affiliated users of the MC service group.\nEditor's note:\tIt is FFS how the MC service server knows the RAT capabilities information of the affiliated users.\nThe MC service server can decide to configure MBS sessions based on different conditions. For instance, the MC service server can configure one or multiple MBS sessions based on MC service group status, e.g., when a specific group is active with affiliated users. This can be considered regardless if any MC service group communication has been initiated. The MBS session(s) can later be used by the MC service server for the different MC group communications associated to the specific MC service group. For this case and based on the MC service group configuration, the MC service server can in advance provide expected required service requirements to be associated to the MBS session. Also, the MC service server may dynamically update MBS sessions, e.g., to modify service areas or provide new required service requirements on demand. For this purpose, the MC service server initiates an MBS session update towards the 5GS. As described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19], this can either be an MBS session update to the MB-SMF when PCC is not used, or an MBS session configuration update to the PCF when PCC is used.\nLikewise, the MC service server can also decide to dynamically configure MBS sessions on demand based on, e.g., the establishment of specific MC service group communications, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.280 [2] for MBMS transmissions. In the case of co-existence, the MC service server may decide also trigger the eMBMS bearer establishment to the underlying network entity (NEF, or BMSC, or joint entity of BMSC and MBSF) if some of the affiliated users of the MC service group communications are accessing over 4G RAT type and with eMBMS capability.\nNOTE 3:\tIt is implementation specific whether the MC service server decides to configure MBS sessions in a pre-established mode or dynamic mode.\nFor multicast MBS sessions, as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19], three states have been defined: configured state, active state and inactive state. Based on these states, after an MBS session is configured and the required network resources are reserved, the MC service server can request the multicast MBS sessions to be either in active or inactive state. For instance, the MC service server can request the configuration of an MBS session in inactive state while there are neither active group communications associated to a specific MC service group nor MC data to be transmitted yet. The inactive session can then be activated to reserve radio resources hence send MC data. The activation may also be triggered by the MC the 5GC (in specific MB-UPF) once it receives the MC data to be transmitted. The MC service server may activate the MBS session once the MC service data becomes available to be transmitted over the multicast MBS sessions, e.g. when a group communication is established for the corresponding MC service group. This can be by explicitly sending a multicast MBS session activation request towards the 5GC. Hence, network resources can be handled in a more efficient way.\nNOTE 4:\tFor broadcast MBS sessions, the session is activated and started as part of session configuration procedures, and network resources both in NG-RAN and core network are reserved, as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19].\nAs part of the MBS session configuration, specific MBS information like MBS session ID and how the data can be provided to be distributed over the MBS session is defined and available at the MC service server.\nAlso, the MC service server can request the configuration of an MBS session with two modes: transport only mode or enhanced service mode. In the transport only mode, the MC service data is transmitted transparently through the 5GS. In the enhanced service mode, the MBS services may include additional services, e.g., FEC.\nEditor's note:\tIt is FFS how the MC service server can request and use different service modes (either full-service mode or transport only mode) for the configuration of MBS sessions depending on the corresponding further specification in other working groups, e.g., SA2 and SA4 related specification.",

As described in table 6.10.1.2-1, the service announcement includes information such as the MBS session ID, MBS session mode (broadcast or multicast service type), and SDP information.\nOptionally, if 4G eMBMS bearer(s) is pre-established in step 1a, the service announcement also includes information for 4G eMBMS bearer(s) or optionally the MBMS service announcement (2a) is sent with 4G eMBMS bearer(s) as specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [2].\nNOTE 5: \tThe service announcement can either be sent via unicast PDU session, or via an existing MBS session, and it can be repeated as needed.\nFor multicast MBS sessions, further information related to the MBS session may be sent to enable that MC service clients join the announced multicast MBS session.\nFor broadcast MBS sessions, the session announcement may indicate if the MC service server requires the MC service client to actively monitor and report the quality of the announced broadcast MBS session.\n3.\tMC service clients store and process the received MBS session information.\n4.\tMC service clients may provide an MBS service announcement acknowledgment to the MC service server to indicate the reception of the corresponding MBS service announcement.\n5.\tBased on the MBS session mode; either multicast or broadcast, the following actions take place.\n5a. \tFor multicast MBS sessions, if MC service client is accessing over 5G, MC service clients initiate a UE session join request towards the 5GC using the information provided via the MBS service announcement. Hence, upon the first successful UE session join request, the multicast is then established, and the radio resources are reserved. The established session can either be in active or inactive state as indicated in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19].\n5b. \tFor broadcast MBS sessions, if MC service client is accessing over 5G, the MC service clients start monitoring the reception quality of the broadcast MBS session. If indicated in the MBS service announcement information, MC service clients report the monitoring state back to the MC service server.\nIf 4G eMBMS bearer(s) information is provided in service announcement and UE is accessing over EPS, the MC service clients may start monitoring the reception quality of the broadcast MBS session. If indicated in the MBS service announcement information, MC service clients report the monitoring state back to the MC service server.\n6.\tThe MC service clients provide a notification related to the announced MBS session in the form of an MBS listening status report.\nNOTE 6:\t\tIt is implementation specific whether the broadcast reception quality level is determined per MBS session, per media stream or per MBS QoS flow level via e.g., measurements of radio level signalling such as the reference signals from the NG-RAN node(s), packet loss.",

      "section_title": "Description",
      "content": "This solution addresses key issue #13 and focuses on how data related to MC service group communications with different service requirements can be transmitted over multicast or broadcast MBS sessions.\nThe MC service server can decide to configure an MBS session per MC service group to transmit the data related to the corresponding MC service group communications. Such group communications can comprise different service requirements. For that, multicast and broadcast MBS sessions need to be configured with multiple MBS QoS flows to address different service requirements, e.g., different required QoS, provided by the MC service server. For instance, application-level control messages or media associated to a group communication can comprise different QoS requirement. Also, different type of group communications can comprise different QoS requirements, e.g., emergency group calls should be handled with a higher priority than normal group calls.\nThe configuration of multiple MBS QoS flows to address different service requirements is associated to the assignment of different streams (e.g., different ports) within an MBS session.\nBased on the functionalities being specified in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19], the MC service server can request the configuration of an MBS session providing in advance required service requirements. However, dynamically, the MC service server should also be able to provide additional service requirements for a configured MBS session, e.g., based on the establishment of an MC service group communication with a specific required QoS.\nFurthermore, the MBS session establishment procedure depends on the MBS session mode, i.e., whether the MBS session is of a broadcast or a multicast type. In case of broadcast MBS sessions, the session is established as part of the session configuration procedure where the NEF/MBSF initiates an MBS session start request towards the MB-SMF in order to reserve the network resources.\nNOTE 1: The MC service server allocates an MBS session ID once (via TMGI allocation request towards NEF/MBSF as part of the MBS session configuration procedure), but the MBS session of type broadcast can start multiple times as indicated in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19] upon request to start MC data transmission.\nOn the other hand, a multicast MBS session is established when the first UE session join request being sent from an MC service client towards the 5GS is being accepted. The UE session join request is sent by the MC service UE as a NAS message in the form of a PDU session modification request towards the 5GS. The message indicates the MBS session ID(s) which the MC service UE is requesting to join, as discussed in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19]. The established multicast MBS session can either have an active or inactive state, where the former indicates the activation of radio resources hence transmitting the MC data to the associated MC service group, and the latter indicates their deactivation as no MC data is being transmitted. The MC service server may trigger the activation of multicast MBS sessions once the MC service group is established and active, as well as once the MC data is available for transmission. For this purpose, the MC service server sends a multicast MBS session activation request towards the 5GC indicating the MBS session ID to be activated. Similar to the use of eMBMS, the MC service server shall provide the associated information between a specific group communication and the stream to be used within an MBS session. This information could be sent in advance over the MBS service announcement or should be provided on demand over an additional signalling message over the MBS session, e.g., like the MapGroupToBearer in eMBMS. For that, table 6.11.1-1 defines the MapGroupToSessionStream to be sent from the MC service server to MC service clients to provide specific required information to receive the data related to a group communication within an MBS session.\nTable 6.11.1-1: MapGroupToSessionStream\nInformation element\nStatus\nDescription\nMC service group ID\nM\nThis element identifies the MC service group related to a group communication to be delivered over the MBS session\nMedia stream identifier\nM\nThis element identifies the media stream of the SDP used for the group communication within the MBS session\nMBS session ID\nO\nThe MBS session identifier if the MapGroupToSessionStream message is not sent on the same session as the MC media\nIn the case of co-existence, the MC service server may decide also trigger the eMBMS bearer establishment to the underlying network entity (NEF, or BMSC, or joint entity of BMSC and MBSF) if some of the affiliated group members of the MC service group communications are accessing over 4G RAT type and with eMBMS capability. For those affiliated group members accessing over 5G, MCX service will also send the MapGroupToBearer as it defined in TS 23.280 [2].",

Therefore, the MC service server can provide default service requirements to be addressed by the MBS session, e.g., associated to MC 5QIs and specific allocation and retention priority (ARP) to transmit the media associated to MC service group communications.\nOptionally, the MC service server may decide also to trigger the eMBMS bearer establishment to the underlying network entity (NEF, or BMSC, or joint entity of BMSC and MBSF) if some of the affiliated group members of the MC service group communications are accessing over 4G RAT type and with eMBMS capability.\nThe MBS session is announced and received by MC service client 2 to n, which are within the MBS service area. The MC service server has identified that MC service clients 2 to n can receive data over the MBS sessions, e.g. based on a notification from the MC service clients indicating the successful join of the multicast MBS session or a monitoring report of the broadcast MBS session (similar to the listening status report used for MBMS).\n4G eMBMS bearer is announced if established to MC service client x which are accessing over EPS.\nNOTE:\tIt is implementation specific, that the MC service server can decide whether to trigger the establishment of eMBMS bearer (or the creation of MBS session) or unicast bearer (or unicast PDU session) to serve the MC service UE.\n2.\tA new MC service group communication is established for the MC service group X consisting of a specific required QoS, e.g., an MC service emergency group communication. The group communication setup can be done over unicast.\n2a.\tFor broadcast MBS sessions, the session is established upon sending a session start request as part of the MBS session configuration procedure, which is described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19].\n2b.\tFor multicast MBS session, the session is established upon the acceptance of the first UE session join request initiated from the MC service UE towards the 5GS, as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19]. The multicast session can then have either active or inactive state.\n3.\tThe MC service server may send a multicast MBS session activation request towards the 5GC in order to activate the multicast MBS session in case the session has an inactive state. For this purpose, the MC service server indicates the MBS session ID to be activated.\n4.\tConsidering that the established group communication requires a specific QoS, e.g., an MC service emergency group communication which requires higher priority (i.e., better ARP), the MC service server requests an MBS session update to the 5GS to provide the new required QoS, if not done during the MBS session configuration in step 1. The MBS session configuration should then be updated and an additional QoS flow may be configured.\n5.\tThe MC service server sends a MapGroupToSessionStream to MC service clients 2 to n over the configured MBS session providing the required stream information to receive the media related to the specific established MC service group communication within the MBS session.\n5a.\tOptionally, MCX service will also send the MapGroupToBearer to those affiliated group members if exist accessing over 5G as it defined in TS 23.280 [2].\n6.\tMC service clients process the MapGroupToSessionStream information to receive the related media over the specific MBS session stream.\n7.\tMC service client 1 sends media to the MC service server over unicast to be distributed for the established group communication.\n8.\tThe MC service server distributes the media to MC service clients 2 to n over the indicated stream within the established MBS session.",

In other words, a multicast MBS session with an active state indicates that the radio resources are established as well as are activated for the joined MC service UEs and MC data is to be delivered over the associated MBS session. Whereas an inactive state indicates their inactivation since there is currently no MC data to be transmitted. Nevertheless, an inactive multicast MBS session is established, with the MC service UEs still in joined status.\nThe transition between the two states is essential to manage the NR-RAN resources efficiently and can be done via the MBS session activation and deactivation procedures, which are only applicable for multicast MBS sessions.\nThe multicast MBS session activation procedure is either triggered by the 5GC once the MB-UPF receives MC data to be transmitted hence notifies the MB-SMF, or by the MC service server by sending an activation request towards the 5GC (either directly to the MB-SMF or via NEF) indicating the TMGI to be activated. Similarly, the multicast MBS session deactivation procedure is triggered by the 5GC once no further MC data is at the MB-UPF to be sent to the MC service UEs, or by the MC service server upon sending a deactivation request towards the MC service server towards the 5GC (either directly to the MB-SMF or via NEF) indicating TMGI to be deactivated.

The solution provides an updated functional model for application plane to support MC services including MCPTT, MCVideo and MCData over 5GS and defines the reference points between the different nodes. These architecture models are assumed to be for transport only mode. Furthermore, the solution provides a list of functions done by the MC service server to enable group communications over 5G MBS sessions.\nTo address sub-key issue#13.2, solution 9 provides a high-level overview and description of the broadcast and multicast 5G MBS sessions. It provides an understanding of the concepts related to the use of 5G MBS sessions for MC group communications. The solution is based on the 5G MBS sessions aspects defined in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19], and it is recommended to understand and identify the functional properties of 5G MBS sessions as it introduces the proper procedures related to the use of 5G MBS sessions. Furthermore, the solution discusses the life cycle of both broadcast and multicast MBS sessions based on 3GPP TS 23.247 [19] and identifies the difference between types or modes of MBS sessions (broadcast or multicast), and how each mode requires different subsequent procedures for MC group communications. Similar to eMBMS bearers, MBS sessions are first configured (with or without PCC) either as a broadcast or multicast session mode and announced to the associated MC service group. However, the session establishment stage depends on the mode of the configured MBS session. Therefore, the MBS session mode is an essential information element in MBS session related procedures - in specific MBS session configuration and service announcement. Hence, it facilitates having aligned procedures, which are common for both broadcast and multicast MBS sessions. Finally, solution 20 discusses which MBS session mode to be considered for a certain MC group communication. As it is implementation specific it can be discarded in normative work.\nTo address sub-key issue#13.1, sub-key issue#13.3 and sub-key issue#13.7 similar to the concepts of eMBMS bearers, MC service server can either request the configuration of MBS sessions to be either dynamically or prior to application layer call setup (known as pre-established bearers in LTE). Solutions 12 and 14 cover dynamically configured and announced sessions for multicast MBS and broadcast MBS sessions, respectively. Furthermore, solution 10 addresses as well the MBS session configuration and service announcement aspects rather in one procedure being common for both broadcast and multicast MBS sessions via the use of the MBS session mode information element. These solutions are aligned, however solution 10 emphasizes on the importance of MBS listening status report for both MBS session modes, and the information elements related to MBS service area may need to be revisited upon further updates in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19]. Solutions 13 and 15 cover the same aspects for pre-established multicast MBS and broadcast MBS sessions, respectively. In the normative work, these solutions can be combined in one common procedure per configuration option.\nTo address sub-key issue#13.5, solution 11 discusses MC data transmission over both broadcast and multicast MBS sessions along with the required information elements. Both solutions identify the required information elements associated with the corresponding procedures. Furthermore, MC data transmission are discussed in solutions 16 and 17 for multicast MBS sessions and broadcast MBS sessions, respectively. They provide separate procedures per MBS session mode where solution 11 is applicable to both modes. Solution 16 introduces multicast session status report information being sent from the MC service clients to the server indicating their successful join of the corresponding multicast MBS session ID. This information however can also be achieved by sending an acknowledgement of the MBS session UE join notification as indicated in solution 10. Moreover, solution 11 is aligned with the life cycle of MBS sessions described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19]. Moreover, solution 11 considers the aspects related to the ability of an MC service server to activate the established multicast MBS session prior to MC data transmission.\nDuring the broadcast MBS session configuration procedure, the session is also established and starts delivering the MC data to the associated MC service group. However, a configured multicast MBS session is only considered established once the first UE session join performed by MC service UE(s) get accepted. The multicast MBS session is then established and either has an active or inactive state. Such aspects are clearly highlighted in solutions 31.\nTo address sub-key issue#13.3, The MC service server can configure several broadcast and multicast MBS sessions with certain aspects, such as service and media requirements, certain service area, or associated with a certain MC service group. However, the MC service server is still capable of updating and modifying any of the previously mentioned aspects once the need has emerged during its life cycle of the sessions. Solution 25 discusses the MBS session update procedure for MC group communication, which is applicable to both broadcast and multicast MBS sessions.\nTo address sub-key issue#13.11, Once the MC service server decides that a certain MBS session is no longer needed for any group communication purposes, it can decide to release the session by triggering an MBS session release procedure defined in solution 24. Furthermore, the server can decide to de-announce it as in solution 28 so that the MC service client can stop monitoring or perform a UE session leave in broadcast or multicast MBS sessions, respectively.\nTo address sub-key issue#13.4, In terms of service continuity, two main aspects are considered. First, intra-system service continuity which facilitates the switch of MC data delivery between unicast PDU session and MBS sessions (of both session modes) as in solutions 18, 19 and 33, where solution 33 provides a common procedure which is applicable to both broadcast and multicast. Solution 18 provides guidance about SA2/RAN mechanism for supporting of individual delivery and shared delivery for 5G MBS multicast. It can be used as substitution of application layer mechanism as solution 33. Solution 19 assumes that either unicast PDU session or MBS session is enabled, whereas solution 33 assumes that both of them are enabled in alignment with 3GPP TS 23.247 [19].\nTo address sub-key issue#13.8, inter-system service continuity between LTE and 5G is discussed in solutions 32, where the MC service clients are guided via the MC service server to switch between LTE and 5G (whether broadcast or multicast MBS sessions) to ensure service continuity when the same MC service is provided in both technologies.\nTo address sub-key issue#13.14 and sub-key issue#13.5, solutions 21 and 29 as well as 22 and 30 discuss aspects related to MCPTT and MCVideo call connect and disconnect over broadcast and multicast MBS sessions, respectively. However, solutions 29 and 30 provide common procedures for broadcast and multicast MBS sessions, and are aligned with the life cycle of MBS sessions described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19], and service announcement concepts in 3GPP TS 23.280 [2]. It is proposed to use the Sol#29 as the baseline candidate solution in the normative work. Furthermore, solution #11 discusses MC DL delivery for MC group communication in general, which can be considered for normative work.",

      "content": "The following aspects and observations to be considered as lessons learned from the study and guidance to be taken into account in the normative work.\n1.\tTransport only service mode has been defined. Use cases related to full-service mode – such as file delivery, has not yet been fully discussed, as it relies on work done in other work groups, e.g., SA2 and SA4.\n2.\tIt is essential to include solutions which reflect the life cycle of broadcast and multicast MBS sessions in alignment with 3GPP TS 23.247 [19].\n3.\tBroadcast and multicast MBS sessions are identified via MBS session ID, which may have any of two types: TMGI, and source specific IP multicast address, where the latter is only valid for multicast MBS sessions. Furthermore, the MBS session mode identifies the session type: broadcast or multicast MBS sessions.\n4.\tUtilizing the MBS session mode information element is recommended to provide common procedures which are applicable to broadcast and multicast MBS sessions.\n5.\tRelated to local MC services, broadcast MBS sessions are local MBS sessions by default, whereas multicast MBS sessions may or may not be related to a local service area. For local MBS services, i.e., for broadcast and local multicast MBS sessions, the service area is to be provided to the MC service clients during MBS service announcement.\n6.\tRecommendations or aspects regarding the choice of session mode (either broadcast or multicast MBS sessions) can be excluded from normative work, as it is an implementation specific matter.\n7.\tRegarding the term “pre-established”, it is recommended to rather use the term “pre-configured” instead, as the concept behind MBS session establishment has different meaning than in LTE. Having a rather detailed look into the multicast MBS session states, once established, a pre-configured multicast MBS session may have state transition from NULL/Configured to “inactive” state directly. Its state can then be triggered by MC service server or 5GC (MB-UPF) to change between “active” and “inactive” based on the need of transmitting MC data to the associated MC service group. However, dynamically configured multicast MBS sessions need to be established directly into “active” state. This is aligned with the multicast MBS session state model defined in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19]. Therefore, procedures related to dynamically configured multicast MBS sessions needs to describe the session state, i.e., being established directly with an “active” state, in alignment with 3GPP TS 23.247 [19].\n8.\tThe MC service server can request the configuration of MBS sessions/creation of MBS session (either broadcast or multicast MBS sessions) either dynamically once the need has emerged, or prior to application layer signalling call setup, i.e., pre-configured.\n9.\tThe MC service server can configure several broadcast and multicast MBS sessions with certain aspects, such as service and media requirements, certain service area, or associated with a certain MC service group. However, the MC service server is still capable of updating and modifying any of the previously mentioned aspects once the need has emerged during its life cycle of the sessions. The MBS session update for MC group communication is applicable to both broadcast and multicast MBS sessions.\n10.\tOpen issues and unfinalized aspects in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19] are still to be considered and revisited during work related to MC services over 5G MBS sessions. Current open issues in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19] include: first, changing related to the terminology of the life cycle of MBS sessions, in specific MBS session configuration step, and whether to utilize the term MBS session configuration or management. Second, possible update on the service announcement information elements related to MBS service area. Third, any future update in MBS session configuration when PCC rule is considered, hence related solutions may need to be revisited.",

      "content": "Related to 5G MBS features and configurations in sub key issue 13.1, it is recommended to consider solution 10 as a common solution which is applicable to broadcast and multicast MBS session. Related to dynamically configured MBS sessions, solutions 12 and 14 can be combined in one solution being applicable to broadcast and multicast MBS sessions.\nRelated to sub-key issue 13.2, solution 20 has brought some recommendations and considerations on this matter. However, the choice between broadcast or multicast MBS session is implementation specific, and not to be included in normative work.\nWhether broadcast or multicast MBS sessions, the members of MC service group are provided with necessary information related to the associated session via the MBS service announcement phase, as in sub-key issue 13.3. Solutions 10 to 15 discuss such aspects, where solution 10 can be considered for normative work as it is applicable to both session modes.\nIn terms of MBS service continuity between unicast PDU session and multicast and broadcast MBS session, i.e., sub key issue 13.4, solutions 18, 19 and 33 discuss related aspects, which can be merged and considered for normative work.\nIn terms of MC data delivery, i.e., sub key issue #13.5, it is recommended to consider solution 11 for MCX group communications and combined with solutions 16 and 17.\nRelated to local MBS sessions, i.e., sub key issue 13.6, they are addressed in solutions 10 to 15. Once local MBS is considered, either in broadcast or local multicast MBS sessions, the corresponding service area to be included in the MBS service announcement. The solutions recommendations are aligned with sub-key issue #13.3.\nSub key issue 13.7 discusses MC service requirements, i.e., QoS requirements for group communications. The interaction between the MC service server and the 5GC to provide the necessary service requirements are discussed in several solutions, including solutions 10, 13 and 15. The solutions recommendation is aligned with sub-key issue #13.3.\nSolution 32 addresses MC service continuity between 5G and LTE networks, as addressed in sub key issue 13.8. The MC service client is guided via application layer signalling sent by the MC service server. The solution considers all possible scenarios within the inter-system mobility (in terms of the MBS sessions/bearer availability to serve the MC service client) and can be considered for normative work.\nSub key issue 13.9 discusses application architecture related to 5G MBS. Solution 8 provides a detailed functional model over the application plane to enable MC services over 5G MBS including the reference point architecture. The solution is related to transport only mode and can be considered for normative work.\nFocusing on sub key issue 13.10 related to 5G MBS functionalities, solution 9 provides a high-level overview and description of the broadcast and multicast 5G MBS sessions. It provides an understanding of the concepts related to the use of 5G MBS sessions for MC group communications. The solution is recommended to understand and identify the functional properties of 5G MBS sessions as it introduces the proper procedures related to the use of 5G MBS sessions. Furthermore, the solution discusses the life cycle of both broadcast and multicast MBS sessions based on 3GPP TS 23.247 [19] and identifies the difference between types or modes of MBS sessions (broadcast or multicast), and how each mode requires different subsequent procedures for MC group communications.\nIt is recommended to combine solution 8 and 9 together as they are complementary to each other, and both can be considered for normative work.\nSub key issue 13.11 focuses on the removal of 5G MBS sessions. Solutions 24 and 28 consider the procedures associated to MBS session release and de-announcement, respectively, both being triggered by the MC service server and applicable to broadcast and multicast MBS sessions. The solutions describe the subsequent behaviour of MC service clients. Furthermore, solution 23 focuses on aspects related UE leaving a multicast MBS upon the request of MC service server. Solutions 24 and 28 can be combined. The solutions provide different use cases related to the removal or the un-use of MBS sessions and to be considered in normative work.\nSub key issue 13.12 is rather MCX focused. Solutions 21 and 29 discussed MCPTT group call connect and disconnect over 5G MBS sessions. Solution 29 can be considered for normative work as it is aligned with the life cycle of MBS sessions described in TS 23.247 [19] and is applicable to both broadcast and multicast MBS sessions. Solutions 22 and 30 discussed MCVideo group call connect and disconnect over 5G MBS sessions. Solution 30 can be considered for normative work as it is aligned with the life cycle of MBS sessions described in TS 23.247 [19] and is applicable to both broadcast and multicast MBS sessions.\nFinally, sub key issue 13.13 discusses the ability of the MC service server to modify or influence the 5G MBS session state (if applicable). The MC service server can update the service area, media or service requirements associated with a certain broadcast and multicast MBS session have been discussed in solution 25. Furthermore, its ability to trigger the activation or de-activation of multicast MBS sessions is discussed in solution 31. Solutions 25 and 31 can be considered for normative work, as their underlying procedures describe the ability of MC service server to control the media or service requirements, targeted service area, as well as the NG-RAN resources associated to a multicast MBS session via the MBS session activation or de-activation.\nSolution 32 can be considered as the basis for supporting service continuity while UE preform inter-system mobility between 5G MBS and eMBMS for the normative work.",
