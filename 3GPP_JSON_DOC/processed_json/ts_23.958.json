GSMA PRD OPG.02 [3] also provides mapping of these requirements and architectures to the specifications from certain SDOs.\nThe integration of OP with the mobile network takes place using the Southbound Interface-Network Resources (SBI-NR) through the set of APIs specified in GSMA PRD OPG.03 [12] which is linked to the corresponding 3GPP-defined APIs. GSMA PRD OPG.04 [13] specifies the set of APIs for the interactions/operations over the East/West Bound Interface (E/WBI), which enables an OP to share network and edge capabilities with other OP(s). The E/WBI interactions enable the management of a federation (i.e. creation/update/removal), management of the application onboarding in the federation, edge node discovery, etc. The APIs for the interactions between OP and the User Client (UC) are provided in GSMA PRD OPG.05 [14]. The interactions between OP and the User Client (UC) are supported by the User-to-Network Interface (UNI), allowing the UC to discover the existence of an Edge Cloud service, to register to the OP's Service Resource Manager (SRM), to trigger the selection of a cloudlet (a point of presence for the Edge Cloud offering a set of resources at a particular location as specified in GSMA PRD OPG.02 [3]) by the OP, to trigger the instantiation of an application instance on the selected cloudlet.",

The depicted Edge platform consists of functionalities provided by both EES and MEC platform. The EES and MEC platform are functionally aligned in the implementation of the Edge platform.

      "content": "3GPP provides a framework for supporting common capabilities for northbound APIs (e.g., onboarding, authentication, authorization, discovery, auditing, etc.) through the common API framework (CAPIF) as specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [10]. The functional model of CAPIF enables an API invoker to access (and invoke) service APIs and supports API exposing functions in publishing the API towards the API invokers. To enable the common supporting capabilities among API invokers and API providers, the CCF is introduced as the functional entity in charge of, among other tasks, authenticating an API invoker, providing authorization for the API invoker prior to accessing the service API, publishing, storing, and supporting the discovery of service APIs information, etc.\nAs from Annex A in TS 23.558 [2], an EAS may assume the role of:\n-\tAPI invoker: for accessing northbound APIs exposed by SCEF/NEF or consuming service APIs offered by other EASs or EES, or\n- API provider: exposing its service APIs for consumption by other API invokers,\nwhereas the EES may act like AEF and CCF (the latter being dispensable if, e.g., a centralized instance of CCF is available, see Clause A.5.3 in 3GPP TS 23.558 [2]).\nAdditionally, as from Annex B in ETSI GR MEC 031 [11], a MEC App may assume the role of:\n-\tAPI invoker: for accessing northbound APIs exposed by SCEF/NEF or consuming MEC services advertised by the MEP, or\n-\tAPI provider: registering (publishing) its service APIs and exposing them for consumption by other API invokers,\nwhereas the MEP may assume the role of API provider, CCF, and API invoker. A MEC service produced by a MEC App or MEP can be mapped into the API provider domain in CAPIF.\nSince the different functional entities of both EDGEAPP and ETSI MEC may assume several roles, the number of scenario combinations is high. Therefore, rather than providing an exhaustive study of possible CAPIF-based deployments, some generic scenarios are presented in Figure 7.2-1.\nIn Figure 7.2-1, it is assumed that:\n-\tEdge Platforms (e.g., complying with MEC platform and/or EDGEAPP) can co-exist in the network within the same PLMN trust domain,\n-\tAPI invokers want to access MEC services, or API invokers want to consume EDGEAPP services,\n-\tExtensible transport for service invocations (Different protocol and data formats including REST-HTTP are supported) is used.\nFigure 7.2-1: Illustration of deployment option using CAPIF\nOn the left-hand side of Figure 7.2-1, the Edge Platform implements CCF 1 to manage the Service APIs exposed by EAS and EES, EAS implements the API Provider domain functions to expose EAS Service APIs to EASs (and ETSI MEC Applications acting as API invokers). The Edge Platform implements API Provider domain functions to expose EES Service APIs (e.g., UE location API, AC information exposure API, etc.) to API invokers (e.g., EASs, ETSI MEC Applications).\nOn the right-hand side of Figure 7.2-1, the Edge Platform implements an instance of CCF (i.e., CCF 2) to manage the MEC Services exposed by MEP and MEC App. Both MEP and MEC App implement API Provider domain functions to expose MEC Services via CAPIF-2.\nCCF 1 and CCF 2 interact via CAPIF-6 reference point, which supports publishing the service APIs information and discovering the service APIs information on both platforms. The CCF 1 and the CCF 2 publish the service API provided by its connected API exposing function(s) and obtains the service API information provided by other CCF.\nAn API invoker (e.g., EAS or MEC App) connected to the any of the CCF can discover and invoke service APIs provided by the API exposing function connected to the other CCF.\nIn Figure 7.2-2, another possible deployment scenario (out-of-many) is illustrated in which:\n-\tTwo ECSPs are present with different trust domains,\n-\tA PLMN operator (or SNPN provider) deploys API provider functions via the NEF to expose northbound APIs, as illustrated in Section B.2.2.3 in 3GPP TS 23.222 [10],\n-\tAn API invoker wants to access MEC services or EES services or wants to consume network capabilities,\nExtensible for service invocations (Different protocol and data formats including REST-HTTP are supported) transport is used.\nFigure 7.2-2: Illustration of deployment MEC using CAPIF across several trust domains\nIn this scenario, Edge platform deployed by ECSP#1 acts as a proxy for accessing 5GS capabilities, enabling in that manner topology hiding for the API invoker accessing the service APIs from outside the PLMN/SNPN trust domain.\nNOTE:\tThe details about CAPIF-related reference points within the same trust domains have been removed for the sake of readability.\nECSP#1 applies topology hiding and provides the AEF details of the Edge platform for invocation of NEF services to ECSP#2. The API invoker onboarded on ECSP#2 is able to discover the NEF services offered by ECSP#1 (supported by CAPIF‑1 and CAPIF-6e). The API invoker performs API invocation on the AEF in ECSP#1's Edge platform which further forwards or routes the API invocation to the NEF.",

      "content": "The following is the conclusion on the alignment of 3GPP Edge Enabler Layer, ETSI MEC and GSMA OP architectures:\n1.\tCAPIF framework is aligned between 3GPP EDGEAPP and ETSI MEC architectures. An Edge application acting as a CAPIF API invoker can discover and invoke Edge platform services from 3GPP EDGEAPP, and ETSI MEC.\n2.\tFor Alignment of 3GPP EDGEAPP with ETSI MEC:\na)\tEASProfile and AppInfo are mapped for mandatory information elements. The mapping between EASProfile and AppInfo can be used for aligning EES and MEC platform and their interfaces in an implementation.\nb)\tUsing mapping between EASProfile and AppInfo, MEC application instance can register to EES by providing mandatory IEs.\nc)\t3GPP EDGEAPP architecture and ETSI MEC architecture are functionally aligned.\n3.\tFor Alignment of 3GPP EDGEAPP with GSMA OP:\na)\tGSMA OPG specified edge computing related use cases, requirements (e.g. roaming, federation and edge node sharing) for Operator Platform can be realized by 3GPP EDGEAPP.\nAnnexA:Mapping roles between EDGEAPP architecture and GSMA OPG architecture\nGSMA Operator Platform Group has published their edge requirements in Operator Platform Telco Edge Requirements [3].\nClause 3 of Operator Platform Telco Edge Requirements [3] provides the OP Roles and Interfaces Reference Architecture.
