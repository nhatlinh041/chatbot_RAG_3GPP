      "content": "Prior to communication with the IM CN subsystem, the UE:\na)\testablishes a connection with the IP-CAN;\nb)\tobtains an IP address using either the standard IETF protocols (e.g., DHCP) or a protocol that is particular to the IP-CAN technology that the UE is utilising;\nc)\tacquires a P-CSCF address.\nThe existing P-CSCF discovery mechanism are either IPv6 specific or use Release 5 or later GPRS. For an IPv4 based IMS implementation, operators may need other mechanisms not currently defined as possible options in 3GPP IMS.\nThe following mechanisms need to be evaluated for P-CSCF discovery in IPv4:\na)\tthe address of the P-CSCF can be requested by the UE and returned by the GGSN at PDP context establishment time. An IPv4 UE would need to obtain an IPv4 address as part of this exchange.\nIf the PDP context established is of PDP type IPv4, then the GGSN may provide an IPv4 P-CSCF address. This does not preclude scenarios, where the GGSN returns an IPv6 P-CSCF address at IPv4 PDP context establishment, e.g. for the support of tunnelling (see clause 5.3.4.3), or both IPv4 and IPv6 P-CSCF addresses. If the PDP type is IPv4 then it is recommended that the GGSN always return both IP versions, if it is capable, using the existing capabilities to send multiple P-CSCF addresses within the PCO IE.\nAccording to TS 24.008 [9], the P-CSCF address in the PCO field is an IPv6 address. Thus there are at least two possible approaches: The first approach would be to avoid any changes to or deviations from TS 24.008 [9] and use the existing methods to transfer an IPv4 address as an IPv6 address (\"IPv6 address with embedded IPv4 address\", as defined in RFC 2373 [10]). In such a case, the use of \"IPv4 mapped addresses\" as defined in RFC 2373 [10] is recommended.\nThe second approach would set the PCO field length to 4 and put the IP address in the content field. This would be a straightforward generalization of the specified method.\nIn a migration period with a dual stack network, it may be useful for an operator to provide a common P-CSCF discovery mechanism for both the early IPv4 only UEs and the IPv6 Release 5 (or later) UEs. In that case, the first approach using embedded addresses is recommended, as it does not require any changes to or deviations from TS 24.008 [9].\nb)\tbased on DHCP. Currently the specifications limit this to the IPv6 methods for DHCP. In order for this method to be used by an IPv4 UE, it needs to be identified how IPv4 DHCP is used to obtain the P-CSCF address. A solution that provides access independence would be that an IPv4 P-CSCF and IPv4 UE support configuration of the appropriate P-CSCF information via DHCPv4. In this solution, use of DHCP provides the UE with the fully qualified domain name of a P-CSCF and the address of a Domain Name Server (DNS) that is capable of resolving the P-CSCF name. When using DHCP/DNS procedure for P-CSCF discovery with IPv4 GPRS-access, the GGSN acts as DHCP Relay agent relaying DHCP messages between UE and the DHCP server. This is necessary to allow the UE to properly interoperate with the GGSN. This solution however requires that a UE supporting early IPv4 implementations would support DHCPv4.\nc)\tother mechanisms, such as SMS, OTA, OMA device management or other configuration schemes are already in use today by deployed UEs. Some of the provisioning mechanisms in use are vendor specific (such as pre-configuration mechanisms), but it is assumed that most of the early-deployed IPv4 UEs will support OMA specified provisioning mechanisms such as OMA Client Provisioning [12] and OMA Device Management (DM) [11]. It is recommended that provisioning parameters for IPv4 P-CSCF discovery be defined for OMA standardised provisioning mechanisms such as OMA DM [11]. The P‑CSCF address provisioned is a FQDN as specified in TS 24.167 [13].\nSince the P-CSCF address is a FQDN, the UE shall to able request the address of a Domain Name Server for resolving the P-CSCF address. Therefore, it is necessary to allow the UE to request a DNS Server IPv4 address(es) by the Protocol Configuration Options IE when activating a PDP context. The DNS IPv4 address can be retrieved according to TS 27.060 [14].\nThe provisioning mechanism in c) does not require any support from the GPRS infrastructure and is thus expected to be used in early implementations from the beginning. The mechanism in a) may facilitate migration to one of the P-CSCF discovery mechanisms specified in TS 23.228 [4].\nIt is assumed that a UE, which has a pre-configured P-CSCF address, may try to use the mechanism in a) when activating the PDP context to be used for IMS signalling. If a P-CSCF address is received the UE would use the received address and otherwise the UE would try to connect to the pre-configured P-CSCF before using any other P-CSCF discovery mechanism.",

The IM CN subsystem might then be IPv4 only, dual stack or IPv6 only.\nFigure 5-1: IMS dual Stack UE accessing an IM CN subsystem\nFrom an IM CN subsystem perspective, the UE behaves like an IPv4 based UE implementation in this scenario.\nThe UE needs to determine whether to use IPv4 or IPv6. One possibility is that the UE is pre-configured to use IPv4 or IPv6 for IMS. If the UE is not pre-configured, one approach is that the UE first tries to establish a connection towards an IPv6 based IM CN subsystem; if it cannot gain IPv6 connectivity or cannot access an IPv6 based IM CN subsystem, then it should try to access an IPv4 IM CN subsystem. This way no delay is introduced when an IPv6 based 3GPP IM CN subsystem is in place.\nIt is important to specify a predictable dual-stack UE behaviour. The following behaviour is recommended:\n-\tIMS dual stack UEs shall always try to initially activate an IPv6 PDP context for IMS communications. If this fails, the UE may try to activate an IPv4 PDP Context.\n-\tIn case the IMS dual stack UE has successfully activated an IPv6 PDP context for IMS communications, the UE shall use IPv6 to contact the P-CSCF whenever possible (i.e. whenever it has obtained an IPv6 address for a P-CSCF).\nIn general, it is recommended for IMS UEs that support IPv4-based connectivity to early IMS deployments to also support IPv6. This makes the migration to a full scale IPv6 IMS considerably easier.\nWhen the UE is connected to IM CN subsystem using IPv4, the UE behaves like an IPv4 UE from IM CN subsystem perspective.\nEven if the UE is a dual stack UE, the following needs to be considered:\n-\tIf the UE has registered with IPv4 private address, then NAT may be needed at the network borders if private addressing is used within the IMS network.\n-\tIf the UE has registered with IPv6, then the dual stack home network will use IPv6 for IMS communication towards the UE, even if it is part of a communication with an IPv4 network.",

      "content": "The following scenarios are those that need to be considered for IMS interworking if it is assumed that there are both IPv6 and IPv4 IMS deployments. This list may not be exhaustive of the possible deployments. The scenarios in the following clauses are divided into the following categories:\n1.\tIMS interworking – non-roaming scenarios, see clause 5.3.3;\n2.\tIMS interworking – roaming scenarios, see clause A.1.1;\n3.\tGPRS access scenarios, see clause 5.3.4;\n4.\tIMS interworking – interconnect and end-to-end scenarios, see clause 5.3.5 and A.2.\nIn all cases it will be necessary to consider the IP version supported by the UE. Particularly, as networks migrate from IPv4 to IPv6, there may exist IPv4 only terminals attempting to access IMS in networks supporting IPv6.\nIn considering scenarios, it is necessary to take into account the use of private addressing and the use of NAT at the edge of IPv4 networks and the implications for protocols with embedded IPv4 addresses.\nDepending on the scenarios, the term NAT in the description and in the figures of this report can also imply a NA(P)T/NA(P)-PT and SIP/SDP aware ALG as defined in the interworking architecture, see clause 5.3.1.1. For example in scenario 5.3.2.2.1, \"Non-roaming - IPv4 IM CN subsystem with IPv6 IM CN subsystem\", communication is only possible via NA(P)T/NA(P)-PT if the other end point is IPv6 only.\nIt is assumed that the NATs are SIP/SDP aware.\nInterconnect networks are assumed to support IPv4, or both IPv4 and IPv6.\nThe main architecture principle assumed for the GPRS system is the use of GGSN in the home network when early deployment and possible migration scenarios of IPv4 based IMS implementation is considered.\nIn the scenarios in this clause 5.3 and in annex A, the IP version mentioned refers to the IP version used for IMS communication. From the GPRS perspective this is the PDP type used. The PDP type is the IP version used inside the GTP tunnel on top of GTP. For example, an IPv6 IMS may run in a network where transport on Gn (on the IP layer below GTP) uses IPv4. See TS 23.060 [6] for details.",

Clause 5.2.2.1 applies to the dual stack UE accessing the visited and home network.\nFigure 5-7: GPRS roaming – IPv4 visited network, IPv6 home network\nIn this scenario the requirement from clause 4.2 is not met.\nThis is an attractive IMS deployment scenario for operators as it does not rely on the support of any explicit IMS functionality in the visited network; however problems arise through the lack of IPv6 PDP context support in the visited network. As such, operators should wherever possible seek agreements with their roaming partners for the support of IPv6 contexts where IMS roaming is to be supported (this should be the long term objective).\nIn the event that an IPv6 context is not available in the visited network, the only alternative for the operator deploying an IPv6 only IM CN subsystem is to use a tunnelling method between the UE and home network in order to acquire an IPv6 address. When the UE is IPv6 only, it is assumed that the UE does not have the capability to use a tunnelling method between the UE and the home network to acquire an IPv6 address. Tunnelling of IPv6 packets over IPv4 from the UE to the IMS CN subsystem is a technically feasible, but there are various issues that would need to be addressed. There would be the need for an IPv4-IPv6 gateway acting as the tunnel end-point responsible for packing/unpacking the IPv6 packets. The UE would need to discover and address it. Also, the UE would need the ability to tunnel the packets. Further work would be needed on how the UE would address this entity, however existing IETF work (e.g. ISATAP [8]) could be used. This implementation would require additional functionality in the UE compared to the minimum IPv6 functionality as stated in TS 23.221 [3] and an additional ISATAP router functionality in the network. Header compression using e.g. RFC 2507 [15] is able to compress both the IPv4 and the IPv6 header. The SBLP mechanisms at the Go interface could not be used between an IPv4 GGSN and an IPv6 P-CSCF, i.e. this solution is not possible if SBLP over Go is required.\nSimilar considerations like in clause 5.2.2.1 apply: one approach is that the UE would initially attempt to establish an IPv6 context to its home GGSN and, if this fails, establish an IPv4 context and tunnel an IPv6 IMS session over IPv4.\nIt can be concluded that network operators, who introduce 3GPP IMS using IPv6, have a strong interest that their GPRS roaming partners provide support for PDP contexts of PDP type IPv6.",

There is no way S-CSCF1 can get any knowledge in advance what kind of IP address the destination UE uses. It could be private IPv4, public IPv4 or IPv6. The S-CSCF#1 can only get the knowledge what kind of IP realms the destination network uses (i.e. I-CSCF). It could be public IPv4 or IPv6. In cases where IPv4 is used for transit, the S-CSCF1 must then link in an ALG or edge proxy to bind the private IPv4 address in the SIP/SDP to a public IPv4 address. Most likely a NAT function is included in an edge router.\nThe network topology of network#2 could be set up so that no NAT need to be traversed in this case to I-CSCF2 (NAT can be by-passed in the edge router). The S-CSCF2 inspects the content of the message and determines that the UE2 uses IPv6. The S-CSCF2 must then link in an ALG or edge proxy to bind the public IPv4 address in the SIP/SDP to an IPv6 address. Whether S-CSCF2 uses IPv4 or IPv6 as transport to the ALG/edge proxy is up to the network#2 policy.\nAdditionally, when both the UE and the IMS network supports dual stack, use of IPv6 in order to provide IMS service would significantly reduce the number of scenarios where NAT/ALG would be required to be linked in between P-CSCF and S-CSCF for the terminating user.\nThis TR already provides guidelines regarding dual stack support in the UE and use of dual stack application servers that can provide interworking without use of NAT/ALG. These recommendations reduce the number of cases for the need of NAT/ALG during early deployment of IPv4 based IMS services. That is, the need to link in of an NAT#2b in scenario 5 in table 5-1 would be minimized if IPv6 would be used within network#2, by either using IPv6 for transit routing between networks or by using a NAT#2a.",

In such cases SIP signalling does not contain any IP addresses which would require a SIP-ALG. The dual stack IM CN subsystem can provide the necessary interworking: each entity forwards the SIP message using the appropriate IP version. Thus the service can be provided without any additional NAT in the network. This allows e.g. immediate messaging between an IPv4 UE and an IPv6 UE or allows a watcher with an IPv6 UE to subscribe to the presence information of a presentity publishing from a IPv4 UE, or vice versa.

Operator(B) deploys a dual stack IM CN subsystem already for the earliest IMS services. In the initial phase, majority of the UEs available are IPv4 UEs, which support this limited set of services using IMS. In addition there may also be IMS dual stack UEs available. Later IMS dual stack UEs become more widely available and in addition support peer-to-peer services like voice. Gradually, operators A and B start to deploy more services over IMS. At some point the IM CN subsystem of operator A is migrated to a dual stack IM CN subsystem; the system can still support the early IPv4 UEs and the IMS dual stack UEs and in addition it is now possible to support IPv6 UEs. Finally the operators discontinue the support for IPv4 UEs and migrate to pure IPv6 IM CN subsystems.",

      "content": "Interworking between IPv4 and IPv6 based IMS implementations and migration from IPv4 IMS to IPv6 IMS can and should be facilitated by specification of some of the relevant aspects.\nFor the specification of IPv4 IMS, the assumption should be made that the relevant roaming scenario for IPv4 is the GPRS roaming scenario with the GGSN in the home network.\nIf IPv4 is used in an early IMS implementation, there is the need for alternative or modified P-CSCF discovery as the mechanisms specified in TS 23.228 [4] cannot be applied as they are. It is recommended to follow the recommendations for P-CSCF discovery as described in clause 5.2.1.\nIt is recommended that SIP communication between UE and P-CSCF uses IPv4 or IPv6 without intermediaries changing the IP version.\nFor some services like PoC, Presence and immediate messaging, dual stack network elements like the PoC Server, the Presence Server or the S-CSCF can provide IP version interworking without use of NATs.\nIn general, the interworking architecture defined in TS 23.228 [4] with IMS-ALG and NATs (TrGWs) at the network border can be used in principle to support all kinds of IP address and protocol translations possibly needed between early IMS networks. In some cases, there may also be the need for IMS-ALGs and NATs within an IM CN subsystem, see clause 5.3.5.2.\nThe early deployment of IMS dual stack UEs facilitates migration significantly. To limit the options, it is recommended to specify the IMS dual stack UE behaviour for IMS access, as described in clause 5.2.2.1.\nNetwork operators, who introduce 3GPP IMS using IPv6, have a strong interest that their GPRS roaming partners provide support for PDP contexts of PDP type IPv6 in the SGSN. Thus support of PDP type IPv6 in SGSNs facilitates migration of IMS towards IPv6.\nWhen interconnecting GPRS networks (i.e. SGSN and GGSN) between operators as well as within an operator domain, NAT should not be used and clause 4.2 should be followed.\nAnnex A:Additional Information\nThis annex contains information that has been investigated during the development of the TR but has been considered not necessary for further development of the work (A.1) or the scenarios help better understand some end to end scenarios but not useful for further analysis within the feasibility study. But the information has been maintained as reference.\nA.1\tGPRS deployment scenarios\nThis clause contains GPRS deployment scenarios that are not considered as likely case for IPv4 based IMS deployment, as it is understood that use of GGSN in the home network may initially be operator's preferred option for IM CN subsystem.\nDeployment of an infrastructure with GGSN in the visited network has been possible from standards point of view with the early GPRS systems. But from the information available today, it has not been realised yet in the deployed systems. Considering also that there is a growth of functionality interacting with the GGSNs and that the implications of a GGSN in the VPLMN are quite large (operational, charging, feature availability, maintenance, roaming agreements etc.) it seems like the visited GGSN scenario becomes even more delayed/unlikely.\nSo, the motivation of upgrading to an IPv6 system seems to be a much more a near term goal then deployment of the GGSN in visited networks. Hence it seems safe to only consider the scenarios where an IPv4 based IMS system always have the GGSN at home.\nThe general architecture arises from this scenario would look like the following:\nIn this roaming access scenario, the visited network can be dual stack, supporting both IPv4 and IPv6, while the home network supports only the opposing version of IP. The UE may be IPv4 only or may be IMS dual stack UE.\nFurther elaboration of the scenarios are described in the following clauses.\nFigure A.1: IMS roaming access – dual stack visited network, IPv4 (or IPv6) home network\nRouteing of bearer path is for further study – bearer path may be:\n-\tRouted to home network and from there onwards towards the destination network;\n-\tRouted from the visited network directly towards the destination network.\nA.1.1\tIMS roaming access – IPv4 visited network, IPv4 home network\nThe call leg is split between different IPv4 networks in a roaming scenario. The GGSN and P-CSCF are in the visited IPv4 network; the I-CSCF and S-CSCF are in the home IPv4 network. The UE in the IPv4 network may be IPv4 only or may be IMS dual stack UE. If either UE is IPv6 only then this scenario can not be supported.\nFigure A.1-1: IMS roaming access – IPv4 visited network, IPv4 home network\nIssues described in clause A.1 with respect to routing of bearer path are applicable for this scenario as well.\nThis scenario is not further considered due to the assumption that GGSN at home is the most likely scenario.\nA.1.2\tIMS roaming access - IPv4 visited network, IPv6 home network\nThe GGSN and P-CSCF are in the visited IPv4 network; the I-CSCF and S-CSCF are in the home IPv6 network. The UE must support IPv6 in order to interoperate with its Home Network and must support IPv4 in order to interoperate with the IPv4 Visited Network i.e. it is assumed to be IMS dual stack UE. If the UE is IPv6 only (or IPv4 only) then this scenario can not be supported.\nFigure A.1-2: IMS roaming access – IPv4 visited network, IPv6 home network\nIssues described in clause A.1 with respect to routing of bearer path are applicable for this scenario as well.\nThis scenario assumes an IMS dual stack UE, which can access the visited IM CN subsystem with IPv4, but when at home it uses IPv6 to access the home IM CN subsystem.\nThis scenario is not further considered due to the assumption that GGSN at home is the most likely scenario.\nA.1.3\tIMS roaming access - IPv6 visited network, IPv4 home network\nThe GGSN and P-CSCF are in the visited IPv6 network; the I-CSCF and the S-CSCF are in the home IPv4 network. The UE in the IPv6 network must support IPv4 in order to interoperate with its Home Network and must support IPv6 in order to interoperate with the visited network. If the UE is IPv6 only (or IPv4 only) then this scenario can not be supported.\nFigure A.1-3: IMS roaming access - IPv6 visited network, IPv4 home network\nIssues described in clause A.1 with respect to routing of bearer path are applicable for this scenario as well.\nThis scenario assumes an IMS dual stack UE, which can access the visited IM CN subsystem with IPv6, but when at home it uses IPv4 to access the home IM CN subsystem.\nThis scenario is not further considered due to the assumption that GGSN at home is the most likely scenario.\nA.1.4\tIMS roaming access - IPv4 visited network, dual stack home network\nGGSN and P-CSCF are in the IPv4 visited network. The I-CSCF and S-CSCF are in the home network which supports dual stack. The UE may be IPv4 only or may be IMS dual stack UE. If the UE is IPv6 only then this scenario can not be supported.\nFigure A.1-4: IMS roaming access - IPv4 visited network, dual stack home network\nIssues described in clause A.1 with respect to routing of bearer path are applicable for this scenario as well.\nThis scenario is not further considered due to the assumption that GGSN at home is the most likely scenario.\nA.2\tEnd to End scenarios\nThis clause describes some end to end scenarios for IP version interworking for IMS cases.\nA.2.1\tNon-roaming - IPv4 IM CN subsystem with IPv6 IM CN subsystem\nIPv4 IM CN subsystem and IPv6 IM CN subsystem are in different networks; each leg of the session is contained solely in an IPv4 or IPv6 network. Either network may originate or terminate sessions. The UE in the IPv4 network may be IPv4 only or may be IMS dual stack UE (if it is IPv6 only then this scenario can not be supported).\nFigure A.2-1: Non-roaming IPv4 IM CN subsystem with IPv6 IM CN subsystem\nIn this scenario:\n-\tclause 5.2.2.1 and 5.2.2.2 apply to the UE accessing the IPv4 network;\n-\tclause 5.2.2.1 may apply to the UE accessing the IPv6 network;\n-\tclause 5.3.1.1 applies to the interconnection between the networks.\nA.2.2\tNon-roaming - IPv4 IM CN subsystem with IPv4 IM CN subsystem\nThe two IPv4 IM CN subsystems are in different networks and hence may use overlapping private IPv4 address spaces. The UE in the IPv4 network may be IPv4 only or may be IMS dual stack UE. If either UE is IPv6 only then this scenario can not be supported.\nFigure A.2-2: Non-roaming IPv4 IM CN subsystem with IPv4 IM CN subsystem\nIn this scenario clause 5.2.2.1 and 5.2.2.2 apply to the UEs accessing the IPv4 networks.\nA.2.3\tNon-roaming IPv4 IM CN subsystem with dual stack IM CN subsystem\nThe two IM CN subsystems are in different networks. One IM CN subsystem is supporting IPv4 only whereas the second IM CN subsystem is supporting both IPv4 and IPv6. Either network may originate or terminate sessions. The dual stack IMS determines that it is in interacting with an IPv4 IMS and thus uses IPv4 at the network interconnection. The UE in the IPv4 network may be IPv4 only or may be IMS dual stack UE (if it is IPv6 only then this scenario can not be supported).\nFigure A.2-3: Non-roaming IPv4 IM CN subsystem with Dual Stack IM CN subsystem\nIn this scenario clause 5.2.2.1 and 5.2.2.2 apply to the UE accessing the IPv4 network.\nClause 5.2.1 is applicable to the interconnection between networks, if IPv6 is used in the dual stack home network.\nEven if the UE in the dual stack network is an IMS dual stack UE, the following needs to be considered:\n-\tIf the UE has registered with IPv4, then NAT may be needed at the network borders if private addressing is used in the IMS networks.\n-\tIf the UE has registered with IPv6, then the dual stack home network will use IPv6 for SIP communication towards the UE, even if it is part of a communication with an IPv4 network.\nA.2.4\tNon-roaming dual stack IM CN subsystem with dual stack IM CN subsystem\nThe two IM CN subsystems are in different networks. Both IM CN subsystems are dual stack. The UEs may be IPv4 only, IPv6 only, or may be IMS dual stack UEs.\nFigure A.2-4: Non-roaming Dual Stack IM CN subsystem with Dual Stack IM CN subsystem\nA.2.5\tNon-roaming IPv6 IM CN subsystem with dual stack IM CN subsystem\nThe two IM CN subsystems are in different networks. One IM CN subsystem is supporting IPv6 only whereas the second IM CN subsystem is supporting both IPv4 and IPv6. Either network may originate or terminate sessions. The dual stack IMS determines that it is in interacting with an IPv6 IMS and thus uses IPv6 at the network interconnection. The UE in the IPv6 network may be IPv6 only or may be IMS dual stack UE (if it is IPv4 only then this scenario can not be supported).\nFigure A.2-5: Non-roaming IPv6 IM CN subsystem with Dual Stack IM CN subsystem\nIf the UE in the dual stack network is an IMS dual stack UE, which has registered with IPv4, then the dual stack home network will use IPv4 for SIP communication towards the UE, even if even if it is part of a communication with an IPv6 network.\nAnnex B:Change history\nChange history\nDate\nMeeting\nTDoc\nCR\nRev\nCat\nSubject/Comment\nNew version\n2004-06\nSP-24\nSP-040337\n-\n-\n-\nRaised to v.6.0.0 after approval at SA#24\n6.0.0\n2004-09\nSP-25\nSP-040530\n0001\n-\n-\nIPv4 access to multimedia services and Mb reference point\n6.1.0\n2004-09\nSP-25\nSP-040530\n0003\n1\n-\nCorrections to scenario – IPv4 visited and IPv6 home\n6.1.0\n2004-12\nSP-26\nSP-040761\n0004\n1\n-\nClarification to the Interworking support in dual stack IM CN subsystem\n6.2.0\n2005-03\nSP-27\nSP-050115\n0005\n1\n-\nP-CSCF discovery\n6.3.0\n2005-09\nSP-29\nSP-050476\n0006\n1\n-\nP-CSCF address format when configured via DM\n6.4.0\n2007-06\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-7 version (MCC)\n7.0.0\n2008-12\nSP-42\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-8 version (MCC)\n8.0.0\n2009-12\nSP-46\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-9 version (MCC)\n9.0.0\n2011-03\nSP-51\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-10 version (MCC)\n10.0.0\n2012-09\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-11 version (MCC)\n11.0.0\n2014-09\nSP-65\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-12 version (MCC)\n12.0.0\n2015-12\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-13 version (MCC)\n13.0.0\n2017-03\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-14 version (MCC)\n14.0.0\n2018-06\nSP-80\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-15 version (MCC)\n15.0.0\n2020-07\nSP-88E\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-16 version (MCC)\n16.0.0\n2022-03\nSP-95E\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-17 version (MCC)\n17.0.0\n2024-03\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-18 version (MCC)\n18.0.0",
