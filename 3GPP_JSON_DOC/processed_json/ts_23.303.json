ProSe features consist of: ProSe discovery (direct or EPC-level) and ProSe Direct Communication.\nProSe discovery identifies that ProSe-enabled UEs are in proximity, using E-UTRAN (with or without E-UTRAN), WLAN technology or EPC. The details of WLAN-based ProSe Direct Discovery are described in clause 5.3.1.3 and Annex C.\nProSe Direct Communication enables establishment of communication paths between two or more ProSe-enabled UEs that are in direct communication range. The ProSe Direct Communication path could use E-UTRAN or WLAN.\nFor Public Safety specific usage:\n-\tProSe-enabled Public Safety UEs can establish the communication path directly between two or more ProSe-enabled Public Safety UEs, regardless of whether the ProSe-enabled Public Safety UE is served by E-UTRAN.\n-\tProSe Direct Communication is also facilitated by the use of a ProSe UE-to-Network Relay, which acts as a relay between E-UTRAN and UEs.\nSecurity aspects of ProSe are defined in TS 33.303 [29].",

In this version of the specification it is assumed that there is only one logical ProSe Function in each PLMN that supports Proximity Services.\nNOTE:\tIf multiple ProSe Functions are deployed within the same PLMN (e.g., for load reasons), then the method to locate the ProSe Function that has allocated a specific ProSe Application Code or ProSe Restricted Code (e.g. through a database lookup, etc.) is not defined in this version of the specification.\nFigure 4.4.1-1: UE to ProSe Function Interfaces for each sub-function\nFigure 4.4.1-2: ProSe Function Interfaces to other network elements and PLMNs\nThe ProSe Function consists of three main sub-functions that perform different roles depending on the ProSe feature:\n-\tDirect Provisioning Function (DPF) is used to provision the UE with necessary parameters in order use ProSe Direct Discovery and Prose Direct Communication. It is used to provision the UEs with PLMN specific parameters that allow the UE to use ProSe in this specific PLMN. For direct communication used for Public Safety DPF is also used to provision the UE with parameters that are needed when the UE is not served by E-UTRAN. For restricted ProSe Direct Discovery, it also generates and maintains the ProSe Discovery UE ID (PDUID).\n-\tDirect Discovery Name Management Function is used for open Prose Direct Discovery to allocate and process the mapping of ProSe Applications IDs and ProSe Application Codes used in ProSe Direct Discovery. It uses ProSe related subscriber data stored in HSS for authorisation for each discovery request. It also provides the UE with the necessary security material in order to protect discovery messages transmitted over the air. In restricted ProSe Direct Discovery, it also interacts with the Application Server via PC2 reference points for the authorization of the discovery requests.\n-\tEPC-level Discovery ProSe Function has a reference point towards the Application Server (PC2), towards other ProSe Functions (PC6), towards the HSS (PC4a) and the UE (PC3). The functionality includes the following:\n-\tStorage of ProSe-related subscriber data and/or retrieval of ProSe-related subscriber data from the HSS;\n-\tAuthorization and configuration of the UE for EPC-level ProSe Discovery and EPC-assisted WLAN direct discovery and communication over PC3;\n-\tStorage of a list of applications that are authorized to use EPC-level ProSe Discovery and EPC-assisted WLAN direct discovery and communication;\n-\tActing as location services client (SLP agent) to enable EPC-level ProSe Discovery;\n-\tProviding the UE with information to assist WLAN direct discovery and communications;\n-\tHandling of EPC ProSe User IDs and Application Layer User IDs;\n-\tExchange of signalling with 3rd party Application Servers over PC2 reference point for application registration and identifier mapping;\n-\tExchange of signalling with ProSe Functions in other PLMNs over PC6 reference points for sending proximity requests, proximity alerts and location reporting;\n-\tOptional support for functionality for requesting UE location via the HSS.\nThe ProSe Function may support \"on demand\" announcing requested by UE based on operator's policy, in case of ProSe restricted discovery model A.\nThe ProSe Function provides the necessary charging and security functionality for usage of ProSe (both ProSe via the EPC and for ProSe Direct Discovery, ProSe Direct Communication and WLAN direct discovery and communication).\nNOTE:\tThe ProSe Function in HPLMN can be always reached if Home Routed configuration is applied for PDN connection (e.g. PDN GW is located in the HPLMN), when such function is supported by the HPLMN. In case of Local Breakout (e.g. PDN GW is located in the VPLMN), a ProSe Proxy Function can be deployed by the VPLMN to support UE to Home ProSe Function communication, if inter-PLMN signalling is required. Whether a PDN connection is provided by Local Breakout or Home Routed is determined by the HSS configuration described in TS 23.401 [5]. UE is not aware of this and as such will not know which APN can be used for communication with ProSe Function unless specific APN information is configured in the UE indicating that this APN provides signalling connectivity between the UE and the Home ProSe Function.",

When WLAN-based ProSe Direct Discovery is used the discovery range is determined by the underlying WLAN technology.\n4.5.1.1.2.3\tProvisioning for ProSe Direct Discovery and ProSe Direct Communication (Public Safety UE)\n4.5.1.1.2.3.1\tGeneral\nThe content of clause 4.5.1.1.2.3 is applicable to ProSe-enabled Public Safety UEs only.\nClause 3 provides the definition of a ProSe-enabled Public Safety UE. To comply with international and national regulations, the HPLMN shall endeavour to ensure that the UE only uses the specific Public Safety capabilities in territories in which the HPLMN is authorised to permit such rights to the UE.\nFor Public Safety usage the operator may pre-configure ProSe-enabled Public Safety UEs with the required provisioning parameters for ProSe Direct Discovery and ProSe Direct Communication, without the need for the ProSe-enabled Public Safety UEs to connect to the ProSe Function to get this initial configuration. The following apply:\n-\tThe provisioning parameters for ProSe Direct Discovery and ProSe Direct Communication may be configured in the UICC, in the ME, or in both the UICC and the ME.\n-\tThe UICC shall indicate whether the UE is authorized to use provisioning parameters.\n-\tProSe Direct Discovery and ProSe Direct Communication shall be accessible only when a USIM authorized for ProSe Direct Discovery and ProSe Direct Communication is selected.\n-\tThe ME provisioning parameters shall not be erased when a USIM is deselected or replaced.\n-\tIf both the USIM and the ME contain the same set of provisioning parameters, the set of parameters from the UICC shall take precedence.\n-\tThe UE shall use radio resources for ProSe Direct Communication as follows:\n-\tWhile a UE has a serving cell and is camped on a cell and the UE intends to use for ProSe the radio resources (i.e. carrier frequency) operated by this cell, then the UE shall use the radio resource description indicated by this cell the UE is camped on and ignore any radio resource description of the same radio resource provisioned in the ME or the UICC. If the cell does not provide radio resources for ProSe, the UE shall not perform ProSe transmission and reception on radio resources operated by this cell.\n-\tIf the UE intends to use radio resources (i.e. carrier frequency) for ProSe that are not operated by the UE's serving cell or if the UE is out of coverage, the UE shall search for a cell in any PLMN that is operating the provisioned radio resources (i.e. carrier frequency) as defined in TS 36.300 [17] and TS 36.304 [32], and:\n-\tIf the UE finds such cell in the registered PLMN or a PLMN equivalent to the registered PLMN, and authorisation for ProSe Direct Communication to this PLMN is confirmed, the UE shall use the radio resource description indicated by that cell. If that cell does not provide radio resources for ProSe, the UE shall not perform ProSe transmission and reception on those radio resources.\n-\tIf the UE finds such cell but not in the registered PLMN or a PLMN equivalent to the registered PLMN, and that cell belongs to a PLMN authorised for ProSe Direct Communication and provides radio resources for ProSe then the UE shall perform PLMN selection triggered by ProSe Direct Communication as defined in TS 23.122 [31].\n-\tIf the UE finds such cell but not in a PLMN authorised for ProSe Direct Communication the UE shall not use ProSe.\n-\tIf the UE does not find any such cell in any PLMN, then the UE shall use radio resources provisioned in the ME or the UICC. If no such provision exists in the ME or the UICC or the provision does not authorise ProSe Direct Communication then the UE is not authorised to transmit.\n-\tThe UE shall use radio resources for ProSe Direct Discovery as follows:\n-\tWhile a UE has a serving cell, the UE shall use the radio resource description obtained via dedicated signalling or broadcasted by this cell (same or different from that of the serving cell), if the corresponding PLMN is permitted by the configured authorization information.\n-\tIf the UE intends to use radio resources (i.e. carrier frequency) not operated by the UE's serving cell for ProSe, which are indicated by the UE's serving cell, and the corresponding PLMN is permitted by the configured authorization information, the UE shall search for a cell with the indicated PLMN operating the indicated radio resources as defined in TS 36.300 [17] and TS 36.304 [32], and obtain the radio resource description for ProSe Direct Discovery from that cell, without performing PLMN selection.\n-\tIf the UE intends to use provisioned radio resources (i.e. carrier frequency) not operated by the UE's serving cell for ProSe Direct Discovery, the UE shall search for a cell with any PLMN operating the indicated radio resources as defined in TS 36.300 [17] and TS 36.304 [32], and\n-\tIf the UE finds such a cell belongs to a PLMN authorised for ProSe Direct Discovery and the cell provides radio resources description for ProSe Direct Discovery, then the UE shall use the indicated radio resources description for Direct Discovery.\n-\tIf the UE finds such a cell but not in a PLMN authorised for ProSe Direct Discovery, the UE shall not use ProSe Direct Discovery in that carrier frequency.\n-\tIf the UE does not find any such cell in any PLMN, then the UE shall use radio resources provisioned in the ME or the UICC.\n-\tThe UE provisioning shall support setting Geographical Areas.\nNOTE 1:\tIt is possible for a UE to use other radio resources for ProSe based on the Geographical Area instead of those operated by the serving E‑UTRAN cell, when provisioned in the UE, even if the UE's serving cell offers normal service and the ProSe SIB indicates that the service (discovery or communication or both) is available. This is to cover the scenario when e.g. the radio resources used for ProSe Direct Communication are not owned by the serving network of the UE.\nNOTE 2:\tThe UE can only use ProSe Direct Discovery and ProSe Direct Communication when it contains a UICC that has been configured for ProSe, i.e. the selected USIM indicates that the UE is authorized to use the provisioning parameters for ProSe.\nNOTE 3:\tThe scenario that a cell is detected and the cell does not provide support for ProSe Direct Communications when the UE attempts to use a carrier frequency configured for ProSe Direct Communication, is considered a configuration error. Therefore the UE does not transmit on that frequency to avoid interference to the network.\n-\tThe ProSe Direct Communication is only specified for E-UTRA.\nNOTE 4:\tIt is out of scope of the present specification to define how the UE can locate itself in a specific Geographical Area. When the UE is in coverage of a 3GPP RAT, it can for example, use information derived from the serving PLMN. When the UE is not in coverage of a 3GPP RAT, it can use other techniques, including user provided location, as determined by local regulations.\nNOTE 5:\tThe provisioning and use of of radio resources for ProSe Direct Discovery described in this clause does not apply to WLAN-based ProSe Direct Discovery.\n4.5.1.1.2.3.2\tAdditional provisioning information for ProSe Direct Discovery\nIn addition to the parameters indicated in clause 4.5.1.1.2.2, the ProSe-enabled Public Safety UE is provisioned with the following information:\n1)\tAuthorisation policy when the UE is \"not served by E-UTRAN\":\n-\tIndicates whether the UE is authorised to perform ProSe Direct Discovery for Model A and Model B when \"not served by E-UTRAN\".\n2)\tRadio parameters for when the UE is \"not served by E-UTRAN\":\n-\tIncludes the radio parameters with Geographical Area(s) that need to be configured in the UE in order to be able perform ProSe Direct Discovery procedures when not \"served by E-UTRAN\".

The UE uses the radio parameters only if the UE can locate itself in the corresponding Geographical Area. Otherwise, the UE is not authorised to transmit.\n3)\tGroup Member Discovery parameters:\n-\tFor each discovery group that the UE belongs to include the following parameters that enable the UE to perform Group Member Discovery when provisioned in ME from DPF or configured in UICC:\n-\tApplication Layer Group ID: Identifies an application layer group that the UE belongs to.\n-\tUser Info ID: For Model A, this corresponds to the Announcer Info parameter when the UE is acting as an announcing UE. For Model B, this corresponds to the Discoverer Info in Solicitation messages and the Discoveree Info in Response messages, when the UE is acting as a discoverer or discoveree UE respectively.\nNOTE 1:\tThe provisioning of radio parameters for ProSe Direct Discovery described in this clause does not apply to WLAN-based ProSe Direct Discovery.\nNOTE 2:\tUser Info ID is expected to be assigned uniquely to a user within the discovery group.\n-\tDiscovery Group ID: identifier of a discovery group that the UE belongs to.\nNOTE 3:\tThe relationship between the Discovery Group ID and the ProSe Layer-2 Group ID described in clause 4.5.1.1.2.3.3 is out of scope of this specification. It is expected that the Discovery Group ID and ProSe Layer-2 Group ID are of equal bit size.\n-\tAlternatively these parameters can be provided from the 3rd party public safety provider application server (e.g. GCS AS as in TS 23.468 [26]). If UE receives a set of data with the same Application Layer Group ID from AS that has been previously provided by DPF then UE uses the data set provided by AS for Group Member Discovery.\n4)\tProSe UE-to-Network Relay Discovery parameters:\n-\tInclude the parameters that enable the UE to perform ProSe UE-to-Network Relay Discovery when provisioned in ME from DPF or configured in UICC:\n-\tUser Info ID: For Model A, this corresponds to the Announcer Info parameter when the UE is acting as an announcing UE. For Model B, this corresponds to the Discoverer Info in Solicitation messages and the Discoveree Info in Response messages, when the UE is acting as a discoverer or discoveree UE respectively.\n-\tRelay Service Code(s): A Relay Service Code identifies a connectivity service the ProSe UE-to-Network Relay provides to Public Safety applications. The Relay Service Codes are configured in the ProSe UE-to-Network Relays that provide connectivity services to Public Safety applications. The Relay Service Codes are configured in the Remote UEs interested in related connectivity services.\n-\tAlternatively these parameters can be provided from the 3rd party public safety provider application server (e.g. GCS AS as in TS 23.468 [26]).

      "content": "ProSe Direct Discovery is defined as the process that detects and identifies another UE in proximity using E-UTRA or WLAN direct radio signals.\nThere are two types of ProSe Direct Discovery: open and restricted. Open is the case where there is no explicit permission that is needed from the UE being discovered, whereas restricted discovery only takes place with explicit permission from the UE that is being discovered.\nProSe Direct Discovery can be a standalone service enabler that could for example use information from the discovered UE for certain applications in the UE that are permitted to use this information e.g. \"find a taxi nearby\", \"find me a coffee shop\". Additionally depending on the information obtained ProSe Direct Discovery can be used for subsequent actions e.g. to initiate ProSe Direct Communication.\nProSe-enabled non-Public Safety UEs which have obtained authorization to participate in ProSe Direct Discovery procedures shall not continue in participating in ProSe Direct Discovery procedures as soon as they detect loss of E-UTRA coverage in the serving PLMN.\nWith E-UTRA-based ProSe Direct Discovery the UE can use inter-PLMN discovery transmission based on the indication from the serving eNodeB or the provisioned radio resource on the UE. How the serving cell authorizes the UE to use inter-PLMN radio resource is specified in TS 36.331 [33].",

When inter-PLMN discovery transmission is supported, the carrier frequency may be operated by a PLMN other than the serving PLMN, as described in TS 36.331 [33].\nBoth open and restricted discovery types are supported by Model A.\nModel B (\"who is there?\" / \"are you there?\")\nThis model when restricted discovery type is used, defines two roles for the ProSe-enabled UEs that are participating in ProSe Direct Discovery.\n-\tDiscoverer UE: The UE transmits a request containing certain information about what it is interested to discover.\n-\tDiscoveree UE: The UE that receives the request message can respond with some information related to the discoverer's request.\nIt is equivalent to \" who is there/are you there\" since the discoverer UE sends information about other UEs that would like to receive responses from, e.g. the information can be about a ProSe Application Identity corresponding to a group and the members of the group can respond.\nWith E-UTRA-based ProSe Direct Discovery when using Model B discovery, the discoverer UE and discoveree UE can announce in the carrier frequency signalled by the serving PLMN. When inter-PLMN discovery transmission is supported, the carrier frequency may be operated by a PLMN other than the serving PLMN, as described in TS 36.331 [33]. The discoverer UE and discoveree UE are allowed to monitor or announce in the serving PLMN and Local PLMNs when authorized.\nOnly restricted discovery type is supported by Model B.\nThe Public Safety discovery is considered restricted. The monitoring UE/discoverer UE needs to have authorization (such as through pre-provisioned parameters) to perform discovery of the appropriate service(s).",

This step is performed using mechanisms that are out of scope of 3GPP.\n1.\tIf the UE is authorised to announce in HPLMN, or if UE intends to make announcement using WLAN-based PC5 and is triggered to announce, it shall establish a secure connection with the ProSe Function and it shall send a Discovery Request (ProSe Application ID, UE Identity, announce command, Application ID, Discovery Entry ID, [Requested Timer], [metadata], [Application Level Container], [PC5_tech]) message for announcing. The ProSe Application ID indicates what the UE is interested to announce. The UE Identity is set to e.g. IMSI. The Application ID represents a unique identifier of the UE application that has triggered the transmission of the Discovery Request message. The Discovery Entry ID indicates whether this is a new request. The Requested Timer is an optional parameter and indicates the length of validity timer associated with the ProSe Application Code that the UE expects to receive from the ProSe Function in step 3. When the Requested Timer is set to zero, procedures in clause 5.3.6A.1.3 shall be followed. PC5_tech is an optional parameter that indicates the PC5 radio technology (e.g. E-UTRA, WLAN) that UE wishes to use for announcements. PC5_tech may include more than one PC5 radio technology. When this parameter is omitted the intended PC5 radio technology is E-UTRA. This request is always sent to the ProSe Function in HPLMN.\nIf application-controlled extension is used, the Discovery Request message also includes the Application Level Container. The Application Level Container contains the request and any relevant information for the ProSe Application Server to assign a (set of) ProSe Application Code Suffix(es).\nIf dynamic metadata is used, the Discovery Request message also includes the metadata to be uploaded to the ProSe Function. Moreover, when the UE updates the metadata for a valid ProSe Application Code, the command is set to \"metadata _update\" in the Discovery Request message.\n2.\tThe ProSe Function checks for the authorization of the application represented by the Application ID. If there is no associated UE context, the ProSe Function shall check with HSS the authorisation for discovery and create a new context for this UE that contains the subscription parameters for this UE. The HSS provides the MSISDN of the UE. When the Discovery Entry ID in the Discovery Request message does not contain a valid value for this UE, the ProSe Function will create a new discovery entry in the UE's context for this request, and will return the corresponding identifier in the Discovery Response message in step 3.\nNOTE 1:\tHome ProSe Function can retain the previously camped PLMN ID and associated ProSe Application Code for an operator configurable time when informed by HSS of a PLMN change. When the configuration timer expires, the previously camped PLMN ID and associated ProSe Application Code can be removed from the UE context.\n2.a\tIf the UE indicated it desired application-controlled extension by the inclusion of the Application Level Container, the ProSe Function sends an Auth Request (ProSe Application ID, Request Type, Application Level Container, Allowed number of suffixes) to the ProSe Application Server. The Request Type is set to \"open discovery with application-controlled extension /announce \". The Allowed Number of Suffixes indicates how many ProSe Application Code Suffixes the ProSe Application Server can assign for the UE. The ProSe Function locates the ProSe Application Server based on the Application ID.\n2.b\tThe ProSe Application Server returns an Auth Response (Response Type, ProSe Application Code Suffix pool) message. The ProSe Application Code Suffix pool contains the Suffix(es) allocated by the ProSe Application based on the inputs in step 2.a. The Response Type is set to \"open discovery with application-controlled extension /announce ack\".\nNOTE 2:\tThe length of the ProSe Application Code Suffix is chosen by the ProSe Application Server from a set of allowable lengths (e.g. 8 bits, 24 bits, 48 bits). This choice is per application, so that all UEs announcing ProSe application Codes assigned for ProSe Application IDs from that Application ID use the same Suffix length (which may be zero if no application-controlled extension is allowed for this Application).\nNOTE 3:\tThe ProSe Application Code Suffix pool needs to support the indication of a large number of or a range of ProSe Application Code Suffixes.\n3.\tIf the Discovery Request is authorised, then the ProSe Function shall check whether the UE is authorized to use the ProSe Application ID contained in the Discovery Request. If the UE is authorised to use that ProSe Application ID, then the ProSe Function shall respond with a Discovery Response (ProSe Application Code, validity timer, Discovery Entry ID, [PC5_tech]) message. The ProSe Application Code is provided by the ProSe Function and corresponds to the ProSe Application ID that was contained in the Discovery Request. The validity timer indicates for how long this ProSe Application Code is going to be valid; the ProSe Function takes into account the Requested Timer parameter, if provided by the UE, when allocating the validity timer. The UE will be authorised to announce this ProSe Application Code for the duration of validity timer and if it remains in the HPLMN. When the validity timer expires or the UE changes its registered PLMN the UE needs to request a new ProSe Application Code. The optional PC5_tech parameter indicates the PC5 radio technology(ies) that is/are authorized to be used for the assigned ProSe Application Code. When this parameter is omitted, the authorized PC5 radio technology is E-UTRA.\nIf dynamic metadata is used\t, the ProSe Function stores the metadata with the associated ProSe Application ID in the UE context, and allocates a corresponding Metadata Index to be included into the ProSe Application Code. Moreover, if the command is set to \"metadata_update\" in step 1, the ProSe Function only updates the Metadata Index portion of the ProSe Application Code, and keeps the rest unchanged.\nIf application-controlled extension is used, the ProSe Application Code is replaced by the ProSe Application Code Prefix, and the Discovery Response message also contains the ProSe Application Code Suffix pool.\nNOTE 4:\tTo avoid interrupting the discovery procedure, if the UE changes its registered PLMN but the validity timer of the Prose Application Code has not yet expired then the ProSe Function may allocate the same ProSe Application Code to the UE, with a validity timer set to the residual validity time of the validity timer not yet expired.\nNOTE 5:\tThe UE appends a ProSe Application Code Suffix from the ProSe Application Code Suffix pool to the ProSe Application Code Prefix to form a ProSe Application Code. When the ProSe Application Code Suffix pool contains multiple suffixes, the UE may use different suffixes from the ProSe Application Code Suffix pool to form different ProSe Application Codes to announce, without having to contact the ProSe Function as long as the ProSe Application Code Prefix is valid.\n4.\tThe UE may start announcing the provided ProSe Application Code in HPLMN, using the radio resources authorised and configured by E-UTRAN to be used for ProSe as defined in RAN specifications or using WLAN, or both.\nIf the validity timer associated with a ProSe Application Code expires (because the UE has not refreshed the corresponding Discovery Request within the duration of the validity timer), then the ProSe Function removes the entry related to that ProSe Application Code from the UE context.\n5.3.3.2A\tAnnounce Request (non-roaming) - restricted discovery\nFigure 5.3.3.2A-1: Announce Request procedure for restricted discovery (non-roaming)\n0.\tThe user sets the permission for the restricted discovery using application layer mechanisms. In addition, the application client in the UE retrieves the PDUID and provides it to the ProSe Application Server. The ProSe Application Server allocates a RPAUID for that PDUID stores the binding between the PDUID and the RPAUID and returns the RPAUID to the application client in the UE. The UE may optionally provide metadata to be associated with the RPAUID, and the ProSe Application Server stores the metadata. The application client in the UE stores the binding between the PDUID and its own RPAUID. If the application client in the UE intends to use the ProSe service, it triggers the UE to perform the announce procedure, providing its own RPAUID obtained by the ProSe Application Server.\nNOTE 1:\tThe procedures in step 0 are out of scope of 3GPP. However, it is expected that the application client in the UE will be able to retrieve the PDUID from the underlying ProSe Protocol layer.\n1.\tIf the UE is authorized to announce in the serving PLMN, or if UE intends to make announcement using WLAN-based PC5 and is triggered by the application client to announce, it shall establish a secure connection with the ProSe Function in HPLMN and send a Discovery Request message (RPAUID, UE Identity, command=announce, Discovery Type, Application ID, Discovery Entry ID, Requested Discovery Timer, Application Level Container, Announcing Type, [PC5_tech]) for announcing. The RPAUID indicating what the UE is interested to announce was obtained in step 0. The UE Identity is set to IMSI. The Application ID represents a unique identifier of the UE application that has triggered the transmission of the Discovery Request message. The Discovery Type is set to \"restricted discovery\". The Discovery Entry ID indicates whether this is a new request. The Requested Discovery Timer is an optional parameter and indicates the length of validity timer associated with the ProSe Restricted Code that the UE expects to receive from the ProSe Function in step 4. When the Requested Discovery Timer is set to zero, the ProSe Function shall remove the discovery entry indicated by the Discovery Entry ID, and release the associated resources. PC5_tech is an optional parameter that indicates the PC5 radio technology (e.g. E-UTRA, WLAN) that UE wishes to use for announcements. PC5_tech may include more than one PC5 radio technology. When this parameter is omitted the intended PC5 radio technology is E-UTRA.\nIf restricted Direct Discovery with application-controlled extension is used, the Discovery Request message also includes the Application Level Container. The Application Level Container contains the request and any relevant information (e.g. intent to use metadata indication in the suffix) for the ProSe Application Server to assign a (set of) ProSe Restricted Code Suffix(es). The Discovery Type is set to \"restricted discovery with application-controlled extension\".\nAnnouncing type can be set to \"on demand\" to indicate the \"on demand\" announcing is requested by UE for the indicated application.\nIf the Requested Discovery Timer is included in step 1 and the value is set to zero, step 2 to step 3 are skipped.\n2.\tThe ProSe Function checks for the authorization of the application represented by the Application ID. If there is no associated UE context, the ProSe Function shall check with HSS the authorisation for discovery and, if necessary, create a new context for this UE that contains the subscription parameters for this UE. The HSS provides the MSISDN of the UE. The HSS also provides the serving PLMN ID of where the UE is registered. When the Discovery Entry ID in the Discovery Request message does not contain a valid value for this UE, the ProSe Function creates a new discovery entry in the UE's context for this request, and returns the corresponding identifier in the Discovery Response message in step 4.\n2.a\tOptionally, the ProSe Function sends an Auth Request (RPAUID, Request Type) to the ProSe Application Server. The ProSe Function locates the ProSe Application Server based on the Application ID. The Request Type is set to \"restricted discovery/announce\".\nIf restricted Direct Discovery with application-controlled extension is used, the Auth Request message also includes the Allowed Number of Suffixes. The Allowed Number of Suffixes indicates how many ProSe Restricted Code Suffixes the ProSe Application Server can assign for the UE. The Request Type is set to \"restricted discovery with application-controlled extension /announce\".\n2.b\tThe ProSe Application Server returns an Auth Response (PDUID(s), Response Type) message. The PDUID(s) corresponds to the RPAUID stored in the ProSe Application Server. The Response Type is set to \"restricted discovery/announce ack\".\nIf restricted Direct Discovery with application-controlled extension is used, the Auth Response message also includes the ProSe Restricted Code Suffix pool. The ProSe Restricted Code Suffix pool contains the Suffix(es) allocated by the ProSe Application based on the inputs in step 2.a. The Request Type is set to \"restricted discovery with application-controlled extension /announce ack\".\nThe ProSe Function verifies that at least one of the received PDUID(s) belongs to the requesting UE.\nNOTE 2:\tWhether steps 2.a and 2.b are executed depends on ProSe Function configuration, or policy regarding the specific Application Server. For example, if the ProSe Function can already verify the ownership locally, it does not have to perform the two steps.\nNOTE 3:\tThe length of the ProSe Restricted Code Suffix is chosen by the ProSe Application Server from a set of allowable lengths (e.g. 8 bits, 24 bits, 48 bits). This choice is per application, so that all UEs announcing ProSe Restricted Codes assigned for Restricted ProSe Application User IDs from that Application ID use the same Suffix length (which may be zero if no application-controlled extension is allowed for this Application).\nNOTE 4:\tThe ProSe Restricted Code Suffix pool needs to support the indication of a large number of or a range of ProSe Restricted Code Suffixes.\n3.\tThe ProSe Function in HPLMN allocates a ProSe Restricted Code and the associated validity timer. The ProSe Restricted Code corresponds to the RPAUID that was contained in the Discovery Request from the UE. The validity timer shall indicate for how long this ProSe Restricted Code is going to be valid. The UE will be authorised to announce this ProSe Restricted Code for the duration of validity timer and if it remains in the same PLMN. The ProSe Function stores the RPAUID, the ProSe Restricted Code and the associated validity timer in the user context.\nIf restricted Direct Discovery with application-controlled extension is used, the ProSe Function in the HPLMN allocates a ProSe Restricted Code Prefix (rather than a ProSe Restricted Code) based on the Application ID and/or the Restricted ProSe App User ID.\nIf restricted ProSe Direct Discovery with \"on demand\" announcing has been requested, the ProSe Function determines if \"on demand\" announcing is authorized and enabled based on the Application ID and operator's policy. If \"on demand\" announcing is authorized and enabled, the ProSe Function stores the RPAUID, the ProSe Restricted Code with the associated validity timer and the Announcing Enabled indicator in the user context.\nNOTE 5:\tIt is up to the policy in the ProSe Function whether to allocate the same ProSe Restricted Code for a set of several RPAUIDs or different ProSe Restricted Codes for the different RPAUIDs.\n4.\tThe ProSe Function in HPLMN responds to the UE with a Discovery Response (ProSe Restricted Code, validity timer, Discovery Entry ID, [PC5_tech]) message.\nIf restricted Direct Discovery with application-controlled extension is used, the ProSe Restricted Code is replaced by the ProSe Restricted Code Prefix, and the Discovery Response message also contains the ProSe Restricted Code Suffix pool.\nIf the \"on demand\" announcing is authorized and enabled in step 3 and there is no ongoing monitoring request, the ProSe Function in HPLMN does not provide a ProSe Restricted Code to the UE and responds to the UE with a Discovery Response (validity timer, Announcing Enabled indicator, Discovery Entry ID) message.\nIf the Requested Discovery Timer is included in step 1 and the value is set to zero, the validity timer in the Discovery Response message is set to zero.\nThe optional PC5_tech parameter indicates the PC5 radio technology(ies) that is/are authorized to be used for the assigned ProSe Application Code. When this parameter is omitted, the authorized PC5 radio technology is E-UTRA.\nNOTE 6:\tThe announcing UE may receive the same ProSe Restricted Code as a result of different Announce Request procedures.\nNOTE 7:\tThe UE appends a ProSe Restricted Code Suffix from the ProSe Restricted Code Suffix pool to the ProSe Restricted Code Prefix to form a ProSe Restricted Code. When the ProSe Restricted Code Suffix pool contains multiple suffixes, the UE may use different suffixes from the ProSe Restricted Code Suffix pool to form different ProSe Restricted Codes to announce, without having to contact the ProSe Function as long as the ProSe Restricted Code Prefix is valid.\n5.\tThe UE may start announcing the provided ProSe Restricted Code in the serving PLMN, using the radio resources authorised and configured by E-UTRAN to be used for ProSe as defined in RAN specifications or using WLAN, or both.\nIf the \"on demand\" announcing is used and ProSe Function does not provide a ProSe Restricted Code to the UE in step 4, the UE waits for an Announcing Alert Request message from the ProSe Function in HPLMN before starting to announce over the air (see clause 5.3.5.1).\nNOTE  8:\tThe ProSe Protocol layer in the UE may inform the application client that it has started announcing. This is out of scope of 3GPP.\nIf the validity timer associated with a ProSe Restricted Code expires (because the UE has not refreshed the corresponding Discovery Request within the duration of the validity timer), then the ProSe Function removes the entry related to that ProSe Restricted Code from the UE context.",

The Application Level Container contains the request and any relevant information for the ProSe Application Server to assign a (set of) ProSe Application Code Suffix(es).\n2.\tThe ProSe Function checks for the authorization of the application represented by the Application ID. If there is no associated UE context, the ProSe Function shall check with HSS the authorisation for discovery and, if necessary, create a new context for this UE that contains the subscription parameters for this UE. The HSS provides the MSISDN of the UE. The HSS also provides the VPLMN ID of where the UE is registered. When the Discovery Entry ID in the Discovery Request message does not contain a valid value for this UE, the ProSe Function will create a new discovery entry in the UE's context for this request, and will return the corresponding identifier in the Discovery Response message in step 5.\nNOTE 1:\tHome ProSe Function can retain the previously camped PLMN ID and associated ProSe Application Code for an operator configurable time when informed by HSS of a PLMN change. When the configuration timer expires, the previously camped PLMN ID and associated ProSe Application Code can be removed from the UE context.\n2.a\tIf the UE indicated it desired application-controlled extension by the inclusion of the Application Level Container, the ProSe Function sends an Auth Request (ProSe Application ID, Request Type, Application Level Container, Allowed number of suffixes) to the ProSe Application Server. The Request Type is set to \"open discovery with application-controlled extension /announce \". The Allowed Number of Suffixes indicates how many ProSe Application Code Suffixes the ProSe Application Server can assign for the UE. The ProSe Function locates the ProSe Application Server based on the Application ID.\n2.b\tThe ProSe Application Server returns an Auth Response (Response Type, ProSe Application Code Suffix pool) message. The ProSe Application Code Suffix pool contains the Suffix(es) allocated by the ProSe Application based on the inputs in step 2.a. The Response Type is set to \"open discovery with application-controlled extension /announce ack\".\nNOTE 2:\tThe length of the ProSe Application Code Suffix is chosen by the ProSe Application Server from a set of allowable lengths (e.g. 8 bits, 24 bits, 48 bits). This choice is per application, so that all UEs announcing ProSe application Codes assigned for ProSe Application IDs from that Application ID use the same Suffix length (which may be zero if no application-controlled extension is allowed for this Application).\nNOTE 3:\tThe ProSe Application Code Suffix pool needs to support the indication of a large number of or a range of ProSe Application Code Suffixes.\n3.\tIf the Discovery Request is authorised, then the HPLMN ProSe Function shall check whether the UE is authorized to use the ProSe Application ID contained in the Discovery Request. If the UE is authorised to use that ProSe Application ID, then the HPLMN ProSe Function shall inform the ProSe Function in VPLMN or Local PLMN if Announcing PLMN ID is included in step 1 with the Announce Authorisation (ProSe Application ID, ProSe Application Code, UE Identity, validity timer, Discovery Entry ID, [metadata], [PC5_tech]) message. The ProSe Application ID corresponds to the request from the UE, whereas the ProSe Application Code indicates the assigned code for this request. The request also includes the UE identity information e.g. IMSI or MSISDN and validity timer in order to allow the ProSe Function in VPLMN or Local PLMN to perform charging. The validity timer indicates for how long this ProSe Application Code is going to be valid; the ProSe Function in the HPLMN takes into account the Requested Timer parameter, if provided by the UE, when allocating the validity timer. If the ProSe Function in VPLMN or Local PLMN receives the same Discovery Entry ID in a subsequent Announce Authorization message, it updates the announcing UE's corresponding discovery entry replacing the existing ProSe Application Code and validity timer with the last received ones. The request may also include the PC5_tech parameter if it was provided by the UE in step 1. When this parameter is omitted the intended PC5 radio technology is E-UTRA.\nNOTE 4:\tThe information provided in step 3 that is related to charging is used only when the requested PC5 radio technology includes E-UTRA.\nIf dynamic metadata is used\t, the ProSe Function stores the metadata with the associated ProSe Application ID in the UE context, and allocates a corresponding Metadata Index to be included into the ProSe Application Code. Moreover, if the command is set to \"metadata_update\" in step 1, the ProSe Function only updates the Metadata Index portion of the ProSe Application Code, and keeps the rest unchanged. The metadata is also included in the Announce Authorisation message.\nIf application-controlled extension is used, the ProSe Function in the HPLMN allocates a ProSe Application Code Prefix (rather than a ProSe Application Code) based on the Application ID.\n4.\tThe ProSe Function in VPLMN or Local PLMN authorizes the UE to perform ProSe Direct Discovery announcing.\n5.\tThe ProSe Function in HPLMN shall respond to the UE with a Discovery Response (ProSe Application Code, validity timer, Discovery Entry ID, [PC5_tech]) message. ProSe Application Code is provided by the ProSe Function in HPLMN and corresponds to the ProSe Application ID that was contained in the Discovery Request from the UE. The validity timer shall indicate for how long this ProSe Application Code is going to be valid. The UE will be authorised to announce this ProSe Application Code for the duration of validity timer and if it remains in the same PLMN. The optional PC5_tech parameter indicates the PC5 radio technology(ies) that is/are authorized to be used for the assigned ProSe Application Code. When this parameter is omitted, the authorized PC5 radio technology is E-UTRA.\nIf application-controlled extension is used, the ProSe Application Code is replaced by the ProSe Application Code Prefix, and the Discovery Response message also contains the ProSe Application Code Suffix pool.\nNOTE 5:\tTo avoid interrupting the discovery procedure, if the UE changes PLMN but the validity timer of the Prose Application Code has not yet expired then the ProSe Function may allocate the same ProSe Application Code to the UE, with a validity timer set to the residual validity time of the validity timer not yet expired.\nNOTE 6:\tThe UE appends a ProSe Application Code Suffix from the ProSe Application Code Suffix pool to the ProSe Application Code Prefix to form a ProSe Application Code. When the ProSe Application Code Suffix pool contains multiple suffixes, the UE may use different suffixes from the ProSe Application Code Suffix pool to form different ProSe Application Codes to announce, without having to contact the ProSe Function as long as the ProSe Application Code Prefix is valid.\n6.\tThe UE may start announcing the provided ProSe Application Code in the VPLMN or Local PLMN, using the radio resources authorised and configured by E-UTRAN to be used for ProSe as defined in RAN specifications or using WLAN, or both.\nIf the validity timer associated with a ProSe Application Code expires (because the UE has not refreshed the corresponding Discovery Request within the duration of the validity timer), then the ProSe Function removes the entry related to that ProSe Application Code from the UE context.\n5.3.3.3A\tAnnounce Request (roaming/inter-PLMN transmission) - restricted discovery\nFigure 5.3.3.3A-1: Announce Request procedure for restricted discovery (roaming)\nThe UE is only allowed to announce in the carrier frequency signalled from serving PLMN. When inter-PLMN discovery transmission is supported, the carrier frequency may be operated by Local PLMN.\n0.\tThe user sets the permission for the restricted discovery using application layer mechanisms. In addition, the application client in the UE retrieves the PDUID and provides it to the ProSe Application Server. The ProSe Application Server allocates a RPAUID for that PDUID, stores the binding between the PDUID and the RPAUID and returns the RPAUID to the application client in the UE. The UE may optionally provide metadata to be associated with the RPAUID, and the ProSe Application Server stores the metadata. The application client in the UE stores the binding between the PDUID and its own RPAUID. If the application client in the UE intends to use the ProSe service, it triggers the UE to perform the announce procedure, providing its own RPAUID obtained by the ProSe Application Server.\nNOTE 1:\tThe procedures in step 0 are out of scope of 3GPP. However, it is expected that the application client in the UE will be able to retrieve the PDUID from the underlying ProSe Protocol layer.\n1.\tIf the UE is authorized to announce in the PLMN operating the carrier frequency signalled by the serving PLMN, or if UE intends to make announcement using WLAN-based PC5 and is triggered by the application client to announce, it shall establish a secure connection with the ProSe Function in HPLMN and send a Discovery Request message (RPAUID, UE Identity, command=announce, Discovery Type, Application ID, Discovery Entry ID, Requested Discovery Timer, Application Level Container, Announcing Type, [Announcing PLMN ID], [PC5_tech]) for announcing. The RPAUID indicating what the UE is interested to announce was obtained in step 0. The UE Identity is set to IMSI. The Application ID represents a unique identifier of the UE application that has triggered the transmission of the Discovery Request message. The Discovery Type is set to \"restricted discovery\". The Discovery Entry ID indicates whether this is a new request. The Requested Discovery Timer is an optional parameter and indicates the length of validity timer associated with the ProSe Restricted Code that the UE expects to receive from the ProSe Function in step 6. When the Requested Discovery Timer is set to zero, the ProSe Function shall remove the discovery entry indicated by the Discovery Entry ID, and release the associated resources. PC5_tech is an optional parameter that indicates the PC5 radio technology (e.g. E-UTRA, WLAN) that UE wishes to use for announcements. PC5_tech may include more than one PC5 radio technology. When this parameter is omitted the intended PC5 radio technology is E-UTRA.\nIf the Requested Discovery Timer is included in step 1 and the value is set to zero, step 2 to step 3 are skipped.\nIf restricted Direct Discovery with application-controlled extension is used, the Discovery Request message also includes the Application Level Container. The Application Level Container contains the request and any relevant information (e.g. intent to use metadata indication in the suffix) for the ProSe Application Server to assign a (set of) ProSe Restricted Code Suffix(es). The Discovery Type is set to \"restricted discovery with application-controlled extension\".\nAnnouncing type can be set to \"on demand\" to indicate the \"on demand\" announcing is requested by UE for the indicated application.\nIf inter-PLMN ProSe discovery transmission is supported, and the serving PLMN signalled carrier frequency is not operated by HPLMN or VPLMN, the UE shall include the PLMN ID of that carrier frequency in the Announcing PLMN ID.\n2.\tThe ProSe Function checks for the authorization of the application represented by the Application ID. If there is no associated UE context, the ProSe Function shall check with HSS the authorisation for discovery and, if necessary, create a new context for this UE that contains the subscription parameters for this UE. The HSS provides the MSISDN of the UE. The HSS also provides the serving PLMN ID of where the UE is registered. When the Discovery Entry ID in the Discovery Request message does not contain a valid value for this UE, the ProSe Function creates a new discovery entry in the UE's context for this request, and returns the corresponding identifier in the Discovery Response message in step 6.\n2.a\tOptionally, the ProSe Function sends an Auth Request (RPAUID, Request Type) to the ProSe Application Server. The ProSe Function locates the ProSe Application Server based on the Application ID. The Request Type is set to \"restricted discovery/announce\".\nIf restricted Direct Discovery with application-controlled extension is used, the Auth Request message also includes the Allowed Number of Suffixes. The Allowed Number of Suffixes indicates how many suffixes the ProSe Application Server can provide to the UE. The Request Type is set to \"restricted discovery with application-controlled extension /announce\".\n2.b\tThe ProSe Application Server returns an Auth Response (PDUID(s), Response Type) message. The PDUID(s) corresponds to the RPAUID stored in the ProSe Application Server. The Response Type is set to \"restricted discovery/announce ack\".\nIf restricted Direct Discovery with application-controlled extension is used, the Auth Response message also includes the ProSe Restricted Code Suffix pool. The ProSe Restricted Code Suffix pool contains the Suffix(es) allocated by the ProSe Application based on the inputs in step 2.a. The Response Type is set to \"restricted discovery with application-controlled extension /announce ack\".\nThe ProSe Function verifies that at least one of the received PDUID(s) belongs to the requesting UE.\nNOTE 2:\tWhether steps 2.a and 2.b are executed depends on ProSe Function configuration, or policy regarding the specific Application Server. For example, if the ProSe Function can already verify the ownership locally, it does not have to perform the two steps.\nNOTE 3:\tThe length of the ProSe Restricted Code Suffix is chosen by the ProSe Application Server from a set of allowable lengths (e.g. 8 bits, 24 bits, 48 bits). This choice is per application, so that all UEs announcing ProSe Restricted Codes assigned for Restricted ProSe Application User IDs from that Application ID use the same Suffix length (which may be zero if no application-controlled extension is allowed for this Application).\nNOTE 4:\tThe ProSe Restricted Code Suffix pool needs to support the indication of a large number of or a range of ProSe Restricted Code Suffixes.\n3.\tThe ProSe Function in HPLMN allocates a ProSe Restricted Code and the associated validity timer. The ProSe Restricted Code corresponds to the RPAUID that was contained in the Discovery Request from the UE. The validity timer shall indicate for how long this ProSe Restricted Code is going to be valid. The UE will be authorised to announce this ProSe Restricted Code for the duration of validity timer and if it remains in the same PLMN. The ProSe Function stores the RPAUID, the ProSe Restricted Code and the associated validity timer in the user context.\nIf restricted Direct Discovery with application-controlled extension is used, the ProSe Function in the HPLMN allocates a ProSe Restricted Code Prefix (rather than a ProSe Restricted Code) based on the Application ID and/or the Restricted ProSe App User ID.\nIf restricted ProSe Direct Discovery with \"on demand\" announcing has been requested, the ProSe Function determines if \"on demand\" announcing is authorized and enabled based on the Application ID and operator's policy. If \"on demand\" announcing is authorized and enabled, the ProSe Function stores the RPAUID, the ProSe Restricted Code with the associated validity timer and the Announcing Enabled indicator in the user context.\nNOTE 5:\tIt is up to the policy in the ProSe Function whether to allocate the same ProSe Restricted Code for a set of several RPAUIDs or different ProSe Restricted Codes for the different RPAUIDs.\nNOTE 6:\tIf \"on demand\" announcing is authorized and enabled in step 3 and there is no ongoing monitoring request, steps 4 and 5 are not executed.\n4.\tIf the Discovery Request is authorized and verified, the HPLMN ProSe Function shall inform the ProSe Function in VPLMN or Local PLMN if Announcing PLMN ID is included in step 1 with the Announce Authorization (RPAUID, Application ID, validity timer, ProSe Restricted Code, UE Identity, Discovery Entry ID, [PC5_tech]) message. The RPAUID and Application ID correspond to the request from the UE, whereas the ProSe Restricted Code indicates the assigned code for this request. The request shall include the UE identity information e.g. IMSI or MSISDN and validity timer in order to allow the ProSe Function in VPLMN or Local PLMN to perform charging. The validity timer indicates for how long this ProSe Restricted Code is going to be valid. If the ProSe Function in VPLMN or Local PLMN receives the same Discovery Entry ID in a subsequent Announce Authorization message, it updates the announcing UE's corresponding discovery entry replacing the existing ProSe Restricted Code and validity timer with the last received ones. The request may also include the PC5_tech parameter if it was provided by the UE in step 1. When this parameter is omitted the intended PC5 radio technology is E-UTRA.\nNOTE 7:\tThe information provided in step 4 that is related to charging is used only when the requested PC5 radio technology includes E-UTRA.\nIf restricted Direct Discovery with application-controlled extension is used, the ProSe Restricted Code is replaced by the ProSe Restricted Code Prefix, and the Announce Authorization message also contains the ProSe Restricted Code Suffix pool.\nIf the Requested Discovery Timer is included in step 1 and the value is set to zero, the ProSe Function in HPLMN shall inform the ProSe Function in VPLMN or Local PLMN with the validity timer set to zero. The ProSe Function removes the discovery entry indicated by the Discovery Entry ID, and releases the associated resources.\n5.\tThe ProSe Function in VPLMN or Local PLMN authorizes the UE to perform Restricted ProSe Discovery announcing.\n6.\tThe ProSe Function in HPLMN responds to the UE with a Discovery Response (ProSe Restricted Code, validity timer, Discovery Entry ID, [PC5_tech]) message.\nIf restricted Direct Discovery with application-controlled extension is used, the ProSe Restricted Code is replaced by the ProSe Restricted Code Prefix, and the Discovery Response message also contains the ProSe Restricted Code Suffix pool.\nIf the \"on demand\" announcing is authorized and enabled in step 3 and there is no ongoing monitoring request, the ProSe Function in HPLMN does not provide a ProSe Restricted Code to the UE and responds to the UE with a Discovery Response (validity timer, Announcing Enabled indicator, Discovery Entry ID) message.\nIf the Requested Discovery Timer is included in step 1 and the value is set to zero, the validity timer in the Discovery Response message is set to zero.\nThe optional PC5_tech parameter indicates the PC5 radio technology(ies) that is/are authorized to be used for the assigned ProSe Restricted Code. When this parameter is omitted, the authorized PC5 radio technology is E-UTRA.\nNOTE 8:\tThe announcing UE may receive the same ProSe Restricted Code as a result of different Announce Request procedures.\nNOTE 9:\tThe UE appends a ProSe Restricted Code Suffix from the ProSe Restricted Code Suffix pool to the ProSe Restricted Code Prefix to form a ProSe Restricted Code. When the ProSe Restricted Code Suffix pool contains multiple suffixes, the UE may use different suffixes from the ProSe Restricted Code Suffix pool to form different ProSe Restricted Codes to announce, without having to contact the ProSe Function as long as the ProSe Restricted Code Prefix is valid.\n7.\tThe UE may start announcing the provided ProSe Restricted Code in the VPLMN or Local PLMN, using the radio resources authorised and configured by E-UTRAN to be used for ProSe as defined in RAN specifications or using WLAN, or both.\nIf the \"on demand\" announcing is used and ProSe Function does not provide a ProSe Restricted Code to the UE in step 6, the UE waits for an Announcing Alert Request message from the ProSe Function in HPLMN before starting to announce over the air (see clause 5.3.5.2).\nNOTE 10:\tThe ProSe Protocol layer in the UE may inform the application client that it has started announcing. This is out of scope of 3GPP.\nIf the validity timer associated with a ProSe Restricted Code expires (because the UE has not refreshed the corresponding Discovery Request within the duration of the validity timer), then the ProSe Function removes the entry related to that ProSe Restricted Code from the UE context.",

This step is performed using mechanisms that are out of scope of 3GPP.\n1.\tIf the UE is authorised to monitor in at least one PLMN, or if UE intends to use WLAN-based PC5 for monitoring and is interested to monitor certain ProSe Application ID(s), it shall establish a secure connection with ProSe Function in the HPLMN to which it shall then send a Discovery Request (ProSe Application ID(s), UE Identity, monitor command, Application ID, Discovery Entry ID, [Requested Timer], [PC5_tech]) message for monitoring. The ProSe Application ID(s) indicate what the UE is interested to monitor and they consist a subset of the data structure of the PLMN. The UE Identity is set to e.g. IMSI. The Application ID represents a unique identifier of the application that has triggered the transmission of the Discovery Request message. The Discovery Entry ID indicates whether this is a new request. The Requested Timer is an optional parameter. When the Requested Timer is set to zero, procedures in clause 5.3.6A.1.3 shall be followed. PC5_tech is an optional parameter that indicates the PC5 radio technology (e.g. E-UTRA, WLAN) that UE wishes to use for monitoring. PC5_tech may include more than one PC5 radio technology. When this parameter is omitted the intended PC5 radio technology is E-UTRA. This request is always sent to the ProSe Function in HPLMN.\nIf application-controlled extension is used, the Application Level Container is included; it contains information corresponding to the ProSe Application Code Suffix.\n2.\tThe ProSe Function checks for the authorization of the application represented by the Application ID. If there is no associated UE context, the ProSe Function shall check with HSS the authorisation for discovery and create a new context for this UE that contains the subscription parameters for this UE. The HSS provides the MSISDN of the UE. The authorisation information also contains the PLMNs that this UE is allowed to perform discovery. When the Discovery Entry ID in the Discovery Request message does not contain a valid value for this UE, the ProSe Function will create a new discovery entry in the UE's context for this request, and will return the corresponding identifier in the Discovery Response message in step 5.\n2a.\tIf the UE indicated that it desires application-controlled extension by the inclusion of the Application Level Container, the ProSe Function sends an Auth Request (ProSe Application ID, Request Type, Application Level Container) to the Application Server indicated by the Application ID. The Request Type is set to \"open discovery with application controlled extension/monitor\".\n2b.\tThe ProSe Application Server returns an Auth Response (Response Type, mask(s) for the ProSe Application Code Suffix(es) corresponding to ProSe Application ID). The Response Type is set to \"open discovery with application-controlled extension /monitor ack\".\nIf the Discovery Request is authorised, and the ProSe Application ID sent by the UE in step 1 indicates another Local PLMN then steps 3-6 are executed, otherwise (i.e. the ProSe Application ID indicates HPLMN) only steps 5-6 are executed:\n3.\tWhen the ProSe Application ID has PLMN-specific scope then the ProSe Function in HPLMN shall contact if needed) other PLMNs that are indicated by the ProSe Application ID(s) sent by the UE, in order to resolve the corresponding ProSe Application ID Name(s) to ProSe Application Code(s) and/or a ProSe Application Mask. The request shall also include the UE identity information e.g. IMSI or MSISDN in order to allow the ProSe Function in Local PLMN to perform charging and the Discovery Entry ID. If the ProSe Function in other PLMN receives the same Discovery Entry ID in a subsequent Monitor Request message, it updates the monitoring UE's corresponding discovery entry with the received corresponding parameters. The request may also include the PC5_tech parameter if it was provided by the UE in step 1. When this parameter is omitted the intended PC5 radio technology is E-UTRA.\nNOTE 1:\tThe information provided in step 3 that is related to charging is used only when the requested PC5 radio technology includes E-UTRA.\n4.\tIf the ProSe Function of the Local PLMN stores valid ProSe Application Code(s) corresponding to the requested ProSe Application ID Name(s) and the requested PC5 radio technology (as indicated in step 3), then the ProSe Function of the Local PLMN returns the related ProSe Application Code(s) and/or ProSe Application Mask(s) and the corresponding TTL for each.\nThe optional PC5_tech parameter indicates the PC5 radio technology that may be used for monitoring. When the parameter is omitted the intended PC5 radio technology is E-UTRA.\nIf application-controlled extension is used, the ProSe Application Code is replaced by the ProSe Application Code Prefix.\n5.\tThe ProSe Function in the HPLMN shall respond with a Discovery Response (Discovery Filter(s), Discovery Entry ID, [PC5_tech]) message. The TTL(s) in the Discovery Filter(s) indicates for how long the Discovery Filter(s) is going to be valid.\nIf application-controlled extension is used, the ProSe Application Code in the Discovery Filter is replaced by the ProSe Application Code Prefix. Besides the ProSe Application Code(s), the Discovery Filter may also contain the mask(s) for the ProSe Application Code Suffix, which is/are obtained in from ProSe Application Server in step 2b. The UE may add additional mask(s) and values for the Suffix part.\nThe optional PC5_tech parameter indicates the PC5 radio technology that may be used for the Discovery Filter(s). When the parameter is omitted the intended PC5 radio technology is E-UTRA.\nNOTE 2:\tThe UE can randomize the request for assignment of new Discovery Filter in order to guard against a peak of Discovery Requests when the TTL expires.\nNOTE 3:\tTo allow a change of the announced ProSe Application Code without interrupting the discovery procedure, two Discovery Filters for the same ProSe Application ID can be provided to the UE (as the monitoring UE would have Discovery Filters for both the ProSe Application Code which is currently in use by the announcing UE as well as the ProSe Application Code which will replace the current one). Alternatively a ProSe Application Mask, which is able to match both ProSe Application Codes, can be provided.\nNOTE 4:\tIt is up to Stage 3 to specify the behaviour of ProSe Functions in HPLMN and/or Local PLMN when a valid ProSe Application Code is not available for the requested ProSe Application ID.\n6.\tThe UE may start monitoring using the Discovery Filter(s) in the radio resources that are authorized and configured by the PLMN(s) to be used for ProSe as defined in RAN specifications or using WLAN, or both.\nIf the TTL corresponding to a Discovery Filter expires (because the UE has not refreshed the corresponding Discovery Request within the duration of the TTL), then the ProSe Function removes the entry related to that Discovery Filter from the UE context.\n5.3.3.4A\tMonitor Request (non-roaming) - restricted discovery\nFigure 5.3.3.4A-1: Monitor Request procedure for restricted discovery (non-roaming)\n0.\tIn this step, the application client in the UE retrieves its own PDUID and provides it to the ProSe Application Server. The ProSe Application Server allocates a Restricted ProSe Application User ID (RPAUID) for that PDUID, stores the binding between the PDUID and the RPAUID and returns the RPAUID to the application client in the UE. The application client in the UE stores the binding between the PDUID and its own RPAUID.\nWhen the application client in the UE intends to discover the announcing UE of other users (e.g. friends in the application), it obtains the RPAUID of those users (Target RPAUID(s)) from the ProSe App Server and triggers the UE to perform the monitor procedure, providing its own RPAUID and the Target RPAUIDs. The Target RPAUIDs of the UEs to be monitored are passed in an Application Level Container.\nNOTE 1:\tThe procedures in step 0 are out of scope of 3GPP. However, it is expected that the application client in the UE will be able to retrieve the PDUID from the underlying ProSe Protocol layer.\n1.\tIf the UE is authorised to monitor in at least one PLMN, or if UE intends to use WLAN-based PC5 for monitoring and is triggered by the application client to monitor, it shall establish a secure connection with the ProSe Function in HPLMN and it shall send a Discovery Request message to get the Discovery Filter for monitoring (RPAUID, UE Identity, command=monitor, Discovery Type, Application ID, Application Level Container, Discovery Entry ID, Requested Discovery Timer, [PC5_tech]). The Application Level Container contains the Target RPAUIDs indicating what the UE is interested to monitor. The RPAUID indicates the identity the UE uses to obtain the permission to monitor. The UE Identity is set to IMSI. The Application ID represents a unique identifier of the application that has triggered the transmission of the Discovery Request message. Discovery Type is set to \"restricted discovery\". The Discovery Entry ID indicates whether this is a new request. The Requested Discovery Timer is an optional parameter. When the Requested Discovery Timer is set to zero, the ProSe Function shall delete the Discovery Filter(s) indicated by the Discovery Entry ID, and release the associated resources.\nIf restricted Direct Discovery with application-controlled extension is used, the Application Level Container may also include some information corresponding to the ProSe Restricted Code Suffix, e.g. group or user-specific information. The Discovery Type is set to \"restricted discovery with application-controlled extension\".\nPC5_tech is an optional parameter that indicates the PC5 radio technology (e.g. E-UTRA, WLAN) that UE wishes to use for monitoring. PC5_tech may include more than one PC5 radio technology. When this parameter is omitted the intended PC5 radio technology is E-UTRA.\nIf the Requested Discovery Timer is included in step 1 and the value is set to zero, step 2 to step 9 are skipped.\n2.\tThe ProSe Function checks for the authorization of the application represented by the Application ID. If there is no associated UE context, the ProSe Function shall check with HSS the authorisation for discovery and, if necessary, create a new context for this UE that contains the subscription parameters for this UE. The HSS provides also the PLMN ID where the UE is registered. The HSS provides the MSISDN of the UE. When the Discovery Entry ID in the Discovery Request message does not contain a valid value for this UE, the ProSe Function creates a new discovery entry in the UE's context for this request, and returns the corresponding identifier in the Discovery Response message in step 10.\n3.\tThe ProSe Function sends an Auth Request (RPAUID, Request Type, Application Level Container) to the Application Server indicated by the Application ID. The Request Type is set to \"restricted discovery/monitor\".\nIf restricted Direct Discovery with application-controlled extension is used, the Request Type is set to \"restricted discovery with application-controlled extension\".\n4.\tIf, based on the permission setting, the RPAUID is allowed to discover at least one of the Target RPAUID(s) contained in the Application Level Container, the ProSe Application Server returns an Auth Response (PDUID, Response Type, N sets of Target PDUID - Target RPAUID - Metadata Indicator, Application Level Container). The Response Type is set to \"restricted discovery/monitor ack\". Each Target PDUID is returned with the corresponding Target RPAUID(s) that the RPAUID is allowed to discover. The ProSe Function verifies that the returned PDUID belongs to the requesting UE. The Application Level Container includes the successful authenticated Target RPAUID(s).\nThe Metadata Indicator is optional and signals whether there is metadata associated with the RPAUID, and if so, whether update to the metadata is allowed.\nNOTE 2:\tIf metadata update is allowed, the ProSe Function needs to contact the ProSe Application Server in every Match Report procedure if the UE desires the latest metadata.\nIf restricted Direct Discovery with application-controlled extension is used, the Response Type is set to \"Restricted discovery with application-controlled extension /monitor ack\". The Auth Response may also include the mask(s) for the ProSe Restricted Code Suffix(es) corresponding to each of the Target Restricted ProSe App User ID(s).\nStep 5 is executed only when the PLMN ID in the Target ProSe Disc UE ID indicates the HPLMN.\n5.\tIf the PLMN ID in the Target PDUID indicates the HPLMN and at least one of received pair of Target PDUID - Target RPAUID corresponds to a valid ProSe Restricted Code including a valid PC5 radio technology match as indicated via the PC5_tech parameter in step 1, the ProSe Function in the HPLMN retrieves the ProSe Restricted Code corresponding to that Target PDUID, Application ID and Target RPAUID.

The request shall include the UE identity information e.g. IMSI or MSISDN in order to allow the ProSe Function in that PLMN to perform charging. If the ProSe Function in other PLMN receives the same Discovery Entry ID in a subsequent Monitor Request message, it updates the monitoring UE's corresponding discovery entry with the received corresponding parameters. The request may also include the PC5_tech parameter if it was provided by the UE in step 1. When this parameter is omitted the intended PC5 radio technology is E-UTRA.\nNOTE 3:\tThe information provided in step 6 that is related to charging is used only when the requested PC5 radio technology includes E-UTRA.\n7.\tIf the pair of Target PDUID - Target RPAUID received from the HPLMN ProSe Function corresponds to a valid ProSe Restricted Code including a valid PC5 radio technology match as indicated via the PC5_tech parameter in step 6, the ProSe Function in the other PLMN retrieves the ProSe Restricted Code corresponding to that Target PDUID, Application ID and Target RPAUID.\nIf restricted Direct Discovery with application-controlled extension is used, the ProSe Restricted Code is replaced by the ProSe Restricted Code Prefix.\nIf the Announcing Enabled indicator is stored in the UE context at the ProSe Function in the other PLMN (announcing UE's HPLMN), then the ProSe Function in the other PLMN shall trigger the Announcing Alert procedure (see clause 5.3.5) to notify the announcing UE to perform announcing.\n8.a\tOptionally, the ProSe Function in the other PLMN sends an Auth Request (RPAUID , Request Type, Target RPAUID) to the Application Server indicated by the Application ID. The Request Type is set to \"restricted discovery/permission\".\n8.b\tIf, based on the permission setting, the RPAUID is allowed to discover the Target RPAUID, the ProSe Application Server acknowledges the Auth Request with an Auth Response (Target PDUID, Response Type). The Response Type is set to \"restricted discovery/permission ack\". The ProSe Function in the other PLMN verifies that the returned Target PDUID corresponds to the UE to be monitored.\nNOTE 4:\tWhether steps 8.a and 8.b are executed depends on ProSe Function configuration, or policy regarding the specific Application Server. For example, if the ProSe Function can verify the permission locally, or the HPLMN is trusted by the other PLMNs for permission control, these steps are not needed.\nIf restricted Direct Discovery with application-controlled extension is used, the ProSe Restricted Code is replaced by the ProSe Restricted Code Prefix.\n9.\tThe ProSe Function in the other PLMN returns to the ProSe Function in the HPLMN the ProSe Restricted Code and the corresponding residual validity timer with a Monitor Response (ProSe Restricted Code, validity timer, [PC5_tech]) message. The Prose Function in the other PLMN also stores, in the context of the announcing UE, the PDUID of the monitoring UE.\nThe optional PC5_tech parameter indicates the PC5 radio technology that may be used for monitoring. When the parameter is omitted the intended PC5 radio technology is E-UTRA.\n10.\tFor each pair of Target PDUID - Target RPAUID returned by the application server in step 4, if the ProSe Function in the HPLMN has retrieved a valid ProSe Restricted Code, it builds the binding between ProSe Restricted Code with validity timer, Application ID, Target RPAUID, Metadata Indicator and Target PDUID and stores it into the discovery entry in the user context of the monitoring UE. Based on the ProSe Restricted Code and the associated validity timer the ProSe Function in the HPLMN allocates a Discovery Filter with the corresponding TTL.\nThe ProSe Function in the HPLMN returns a Discovery Response (Discovery Filter(s), Metadata Indicator, Discovery Entry ID, Application Level Container, [PC5_tech]) message to the UE. The Discovery Filter includes the ProSe Restricted Code to be monitored and the TTL that indicates for how long the related ProSe Restricted Code in the Discovery Filter is valid after it is received. If configured by the operator, the Target RPAUID(s) and metadata corresponding to the ProSe Restricted Code(s) may be included in the Discovery Response message. The ProSe Function stores in the user context all the parameters passed to the UE.\nIf restricted Direct Discovery with application-controlled extension is used, the ProSe Restricted Code is replaced by the ProSe Restricted Code Prefix. Besides the ProSe Restricted Code(s), the Discovery Filter may also contain the mask(s) for the ProSe Restricted Code Suffix, which is/are obtained in from ProSe Application Server in step 4. The UE may add additional mask(s) and values for the Suffix part.\nIf the Requested Discovery Timer is included in step 1 and the value is set to zero, the TTL in the Discovery Response message is set to zero.\nThe optional PC5_tech parameter indicates the PC5 radio technology that may be used for the Discovery Filter(s). When the parameter is omitted the intended PC5 radio technology is E-UTRA.\nNOTE 5:\tWhen the Target RPAUID, corresponding to the ProSe Restricted Code in the Discovery Filter, is included in the Discovery Response message, then the Match Report procedure may be skipped.\nNOTE 6:\tThe ProSe Restricted Code in different Discovery Filters may be the same, for example, when the monitoring user is a friend of the announcing user in more than one application, for which the announcing user was allocated the same ProSe Restricted Code.\n11.\tThe UE obtains the corresponding radio resources that are authorized and configured by the PLMN(s) to be used for ProSe as defined in RAN specifications or uses WLAN, or both and starts to monitor using the Discovery Filter.

This step is performed using mechanisms out of scope of 3GPP.\n1.\tIf the UE is authorised to monitor in at least one PLMN, or if UE intends to use WLAN-based PC5 for monitoring and is interested to monitor certain ProSe Application ID(s), it shall establish a secure connection with the ProSe Function in HPLMN and it shall send a Discovery Request (ProSe Application ID(s), UE Identity, monitor command, Application ID, Discovery Entry ID, [Requested Timer], [PC5_tech]) message for monitoring. The ProSe Application ID(s) indicate what the UE is interested to monitor and they consist of a subset of the data structure of the PLMN. The UE Identity is set to e.g. IMSI. The Application ID represents a unique identifier of the application that has triggered the transmission of the Discovery Request message. The Discovery Entry ID indicates whether this is a new request. The Requested Timer is an optional parameter. When the Requested Timer is set to zero, procedures in clause 5.3.6A.1.3 shall be followed. PC5_tech is an optional parameter that indicates the PC5 radio technology (e.g. E-UTRA, WLAN) that UE wishes to use for monitoring. PC5_tech may include more than one PC5 radio technology. When this parameter is omitted the intended PC5 radio technology is E-UTRA. This request is always sent to the ProSe Function in HPLMN.\nIf application-controlled extension is used, the Application Level Container is included; it contains information corresponding to the ProSe Application Code Suffix.\n2.\tThe ProSe Function checks for the authorization of the application represented by the Application ID. If there is no associated UE context, the ProSe Function shall check with HSS the authorisation for discovery and, if necessary, create a new context for this UE that contains the subscription parameters for this UE. The authorisation information also contains the PLMNs that this UE is allowed to perform discovery. The HSS provides also the VPLMN ID where the UE is registered. The HSS provides the MSISDN of the UE. When the Discovery Entry ID in the Discovery Request message does not contain a valid value for this UE, the ProSe Function will create a new discovery entry in the UE's context for this request, and will return the corresponding identifier in the Discovery Response message in step 5.\n2a.\tIf the UE indicated that it desires application-controlled extension by the inclusion of the Application Level Container, the ProSe Function sends an Auth Request (ProSe Application ID, Request Type, Application Level Container) to the Application Server indicated by the Application ID. The Request Type is set to \"open discovery with application controlled extension/monitor\".\n2b.\tThe ProSe Application Server returns an Auth Response (Response Type, mask(s) for the ProSe Application Code Suffix(es) corresponding to ProSe Application ID). The Response Type is set to \"open discovery with application-controlled extension /monitor ack\".\nIf the Discovery Request is authorised, and the ProSe Application ID sent by the UE in step 1 indicates another PLMN and not the HPLMN, then steps 3-6 are executed, otherwise (i.e. the ProSe Application ID indicates HPLMN) only steps 5-6 are executed:\n3.\tWhen the ProSe Application ID has PLMN-specific scope then the ProSe Function in HPLMN shall contact (if needed) other PLMNs that are indicated by the ProSe Application ID(s) sent by the UE, in order to resolve the corresponding ProSe Application ID Name(s) to ProSe Application Code(s) and/or a ProSe Application Mask. The request shall also include the UE identity information e.g. IMSI or MSISDN, in order to allow the ProSe Function in Local/Visited PLMN to perform charging and the Discovery Entry ID. If the ProSe Function in other PLMN receives the same Discovery Entry ID in a subsequent Monitor Request message, it updates the monitoring UE's corresponding discovery entry with the received corresponding parameters. The request may also include the PC5_tech parameter if it was provided by the UE in step 1. When this parameter is omitted the intended PC5 radio technology is E-UTRA.\nNOTE 1:\tThe information provided in step 3 that is related to charging is used only when the requested PC5 radio technology includes E-UTRA.\n4.\tIf the ProSe Function of the other PLMN stores valid ProSe Application Code(s) corresponding to the requested ProSe Application ID Name(s) and the requested PC5 radio technology (as indicated in step 3), then the ProSe Function of the VPLMN/Local PLMN returns the related ProSe Application Code(s) and/or ProSe Application Mask(s) and the corresponding TTL for each. Based on the UE context in the ProSe Function of the VPLMN/Local PLMN, it also includes the PLMN ID of the PLMN that the \"announcing UE\" is registered (if roaming) for the ProSe Function in HPLMN of the monitoring UE to store in the associated UE context.\nThe optional PC5_tech parameter indicates the PC5 radio technology that may be used for monitoring. When the parameter is omitted the intended PC5 radio technology is E-UTRA.\nIf application-controlled extension is used, the ProSe Application Code is replaced by the ProSe Application Code Prefix.\n5.\tThe ProSe Function in the HPLMN responds with a Discovery Response (Discovery Filter(s), Discovery Entry ID, [PC5_tech]) message. The TTL(s) in the Discovery Filter(s) indicate for how long the Discovery Filter(s) are going to be valid.\nThe optional PC5_tech parameter indicates the PC5 radio technology that may be used for the Discovery Filter(s). When the parameter is omitted the intended PC5 radio technology is E-UTRA.\nIf application-controlled extension is used, the ProSe Application Code in the Discovery Filter is replaced by the ProSe Application Code Prefix. Besides the ProSe Application Code(s), the Discovery Filter may also contain the mask(s) for the ProSe Application Code Suffix, which is/are obtained in from ProSe Application Server in step 2b. The UE may add additional mask(s) and values for the Suffix part.\nNOTE 2:\tThe UE can randomize the request for assignment of new Discovery Filter in order to guard against a peak of Discovery Requests when the TTL expires.\nNOTE 3:\tTo allow a change of the announced ProSe Application Code without interrupting the discovery procedure, two Discovery Filters for the same ProSe Application ID can be provided to the UE (as the monitoring UE would have Discovery Filters for both the ProSe Application Code which is currently in use by the announcing UE as well as the ProSe Application Code which will replace the current one). Alternatively a ProSe Application Mask, which is able to match both ProSe Application Codes, can be provided.\nNOTE 4:\tIt is up to Stage 3 to specify the behaviour of ProSe Functions in HPLMN and/or Local PLMN when a valid ProSe Application Code is not available for the requested ProSe Application ID.\n6.\tThe UE may start monitoring using the Discovery Filter(s) in the radio resources that are authorized and configured by the PLMN(s) to be used for ProSe as defined in RAN specifications or using WLAN, or both.\nIf the TTL corresponding to a Discovery Filter expires (because the UE has not refreshed the corresponding Discovery Request within the duration of the TTL), then the ProSe Function removes the entry related to that Discovery Filter from the UE context.\n5.3.3.5A\tMonitor Request (roaming) - restricted discovery\nFigure 5.3.3.5A-1: Monitor Request procedure for restricted discovery (roaming)\n0.\tIn this step, the application client in the UE retrieves its own PDUID and provides it to the ProSe Application Server. The ProSe Application Server allocates a Restricted ProSe Application User ID (RPAUID) for that PDUID, stores the binding between the PDUID and the RPAUID and returns the RPAUID to the application client in the UE. The application client in the UE stores the binding between the PDUID and its own RPAUID.\nWhen the application client in the UE intends to discover the announcing UE of other users (e.g. friends in the application), it obtains the RPAUID of those users (Target RPAUIDs) from the ProSe App Server and triggers the UE to perform the monitor procedure, providing its own RPAUID and the Target RPAUIDs. The Target RPAUIDs of the UEs to be monitored are passed in an Application Level Container.\nNOTE 1:\tThe procedures in step 0 are out of scope of 3GPP. However, it is expected that the application client in the UE will be able to retrieve the PDUID from the underlying ProSe Protocol layer.\n1.\tIf the UE is authorised to monitor in at least one PLMN, or if UE intends to use WLAN-based PC5 for monitoring and is triggered by the application client to monitor, it shall establish a secure connection with the ProSe Function in HPLMN and it shall send a Discovery Request message to get the Discovery Filter for monitoring (RPAUID, UE Identity, command=monitor, Discovery Type, Application ID, Application Level Container, Discovery Entry ID, Requested Discovery Timer, [PC5_tech]). The Application Level Container contains the Target RPAUIDs indicating what the UE is interested to monitor. The RPAUID indicates the identity the UE uses to obtain the permission to monitor. The UE Identity is set to IMSI. The Application ID represents a unique identifier of the application that has triggered the transmission of the Discovery Request message. Discovery Type is set to \"restricted discovery\". The Discovery Entry ID indicates whether this is a new request. The Requested Discovery Timer is an optional parameter. When the Requested Discovery Timer is set to zero, the ProSe Function shall delete the Discovery Filter(s) indicated by the Discovery Entry ID, and release the associated resources.\nIf restricted Direct Discovery with application-controlled extension is used, the Application Level Container may also include some information corresponding to the ProSe Restricted Code Suffix, e.g. group or user-specific information. The Discovery Type is set to \"restricted discovery with application-controlled extension\".\nPC5_tech is an optional parameter that indicates the PC5 radio technology (e.g. E-UTRA, WLAN) that UE wishes to use for monitoring. PC5_tech may include more than one PC5 radio technology. When this parameter is omitted the intended PC5 radio technology is E-UTRA.\nIf the Requested Discovery Timer is included in step 1 and the value is set to zero, step 2 to step 9 are skipped.\n2.\tThe ProSe Function checks for the authorization of the application represented by the Application ID. If there is no associated UE context, the ProSe Function shall check with HSS the authorisation for discovery and, if necessary, create a new context for this UE that contains the subscription parameters for this UE. The HSS provides also the PLMN ID where the UE is registered. The HSS provides the MSISDN of the UE. When the Discovery Entry ID in the Discovery Request message does not contain a valid value for this UE, the ProSe Function creates a new discovery entry in the UE's context for this request, and returns the corresponding identifier in the Discovery Response message in step 10.\n3.\tThe ProSe Function sends an Auth Request (RPAUID, Request Type, Application Level Container) to the Application Server indicated by the Application ID. The Request Type is set to \"restricted discovery/monitor\".\nIf restricted Direct Discovery with application-controlled extension is used, the Request Type is set to \"restricted discovery with application-controlled extension\".\n4.\tIf, based on the permission setting, the RPAUID is allowed to discover at least one of the Target RPAUID(s) contained in the Application Level Container, the ProSe Application Server returns an Auth Response (PDUID, Response Type, N sets of Target PDUID - Target RPAUID - Metadata Indicator, Application Level Container). The Response Type is set to \"restricted discovery/monitor ack\". Each Target PDUID is returned with the corresponding Target RPAUID(s) that the RPAUID is allowed to discover. The ProSe Function verifies that the returned PDUID belongs to the requesting UE. The Application Level Container includes the successful authenticated Target RPAUID(s).\nThe Metadata Indicator is optional and signals whether there is metadata associated with the RPAUID, and if so, whether update to the metadata is allowed.\nNOTE 2:\tIf metadata update is allowed, the ProSe Function needs to contact the ProSe Application Server in every Match Report procedure if the UE desires the latest metadata.\nIf restricted Direct Discovery with application-controlled extension is used, the Response Type is set to \"Restricted discovery with application-controlled extension /monitor ack\". The Auth Response may also include the mask(s) for the ProSe Restricted Code Suffix(es) corresponding to each of the Target Restricted ProSe App User ID(s).\nStep 5 is executed only when the PLMN ID in the Target ProSe Disc UE ID indicates the HPLMN.\n5.\tIf the PLMN ID in the Target PDUID indicates the HPLMN and at least one of received pair of Target PDUID - Target RPAUID corresponds to a valid ProSe Restricted Code including a valid PC5 radio technology match as indicated via the PC5_tech parameter in step 1, the ProSe Function in the HPLMN retrieves the ProSe Restricted Code corresponding to that Target PDUID, Application ID and Target RPAUID. The Prose Function in the HPLMN stores, in the context of the announcing UE, the PDUID of the monitoring UE and the allocated validity timer.\nIf restricted Direct Discovery with application-controlled extension is used, the ProSe Restricted Code is replaced by the ProSe Restricted Code Prefix.\nIf the Announcing Enabled indicator is stored in the UE context, the ProSe Function of HPLMN shall trigger the Announcing Alert procedure (see clause 5.3.5) to notify the announcing UE to perform announcing.\nSteps 6-9 are executed only when the PLMN ID in the Target ProSe Disc UE ID indicates a different PLMN.\n6.\tIf the PLMN ID in the Target ProSe Disc UE ID indicates a PLMN different from the HPLMN, the ProSe Function in the HPLMN contacts the ProSe Function in that PLMN to retrieve the corresponding ProSe Restricted Code with a Monitor Request (RPAUID, UE Identity, Target PDUID, Application ID, Target RPAUID, Discovery Entry ID, [PC5_tech]) message. The request shall include the UE identity information e.g. IMSI or MSISDN in order to allow the ProSe Function in that PLMN to perform charging. If the ProSe Function in other PLMN receives the same Discovery Entry ID in a subsequent Monitor Request message, it updates the monitoring UE's corresponding discovery entry with the received corresponding parameters. The request may also include the PC5_tech parameter if it was provided by the UE in step 1. When this parameter is omitted the intended PC5 radio technology is E-UTRA.\nNOTE 3:\tThe information provided in step 3 that is related to charging is used only when the requested PC5 radio technology includes E-UTRA.\n7.\tIf the pair of Target PDUID - Target RPAUID received from the HPLMN ProSe Function corresponds to a valid ProSe Restricted Code including a valid PC5 radio technology match as indicated via the PC5_tech parameter in step 6, the ProSe Function in the other PLMN retrieves the ProSe Restricted Code corresponding to that Target PDUID, Application ID and Target RPAUID.\nIf restricted Direct Discovery with application-controlled extension is used, the ProSe Restricted Code is replaced by the ProSe Restricted Code Prefix.\nIf the Announcing Enabled indicator is stored in the UE context, the ProSe Function of HPLMN shall trigger the Announcing Alert procedure (see clause 5.3.5) to notify the announcing UE to perform announcing.\n8.a\tOptionally, the ProSe Function in the other PLMN sends an Auth Request (RPAUID , Request Type, Target RPAUID) to the Application Server indicated by the Application ID. The Request Type is set to \"restricted discovery/permission\".\n8.b\tIf, based on the permission setting, the RPAUID is allowed to discover the Target RPAUID, the ProSe Application Server acknowledges the Auth Request with an Auth Response (Target PDUID, Response Type). The Response Type is set to \"restricted discovery/permission ack\". The ProSe Function in the other PLMN verifies that the returned Target PDUID corresponds to the UE to be monitored.\nIf the Requested Discovery Timer is included in step 1 and the value is set to zero, the TTL in the Discovery Response message is set to zero.\nNOTE 4:\tWhether steps 8.a and 8.b are executed depends on ProSe Function configuration, or policy regarding the specific Application Server. For example, if the ProSe Function can verify the permission locally, or the HPLMN is trusted by the other PLMNs for permission control, these steps are not needed.\n9.\tThe ProSe Function in the other PLMN returns to the ProSe Function in the HPLMN the ProSe Restricted Code and the corresponding residual validity timer with a Monitor Response (ProSe Restricted Code, validity timer) message. The Prose Function in the other PLMN also stores, in the context of the announcing UE, the PDUID of the monitoring UE and the allocated validity timer. The response may also include the PC5_tech parameter if it was provided by the HPLMN ProSe Function in step 7. When this parameter is omitted the intended PC5 radio technology is E-UTRA.\n10.\tFor each pair of Target PDUID - Target RPAUID returned by the application server in step 4, if the ProSe Function in the HPLMN has retrieved a valid ProSe Restricted Code, it builds the binding between ProSe Restricted Code with validity timer, Application ID, Target RPAUID, Metadata Indicator and Target PDUID and stores it into the discovery entry in the user context of the monitoring UE. Based on the ProSe Restricted Code and the associated validity timer the ProSe Function in the HPLMN allocates a Discovery Filter with the corresponding TTL.\nThe ProSe Function in the HPLMN returns a Discovery Response (Discovery Filter(s), Metadata Indicator, Discovery Entry ID, Application Level Container, [PC5_tech]) message to the UE. The Discovery Filter includes the ProSe Restricted Code to be monitored and the TTL that indicates for how long the related ProSe Restricted Code in the Discovery Filter is valid after it is received. If configured by the operator, the Target RPAUID(s) and metadata corresponding to the ProSe Restricted Code(s) may be included in the Discovery Response message. The ProSe Function stores in the user context all the parameters passed to the UE.\nIf restricted Direct Discovery with application-controlled extension is used, the ProSe Restricted Code is replaced by the ProSe Restricted Code Prefix. Besides the ProSe Restricted Code(s), the Discovery Filter may also contain the mask(s) for the ProSe Restricted Code Suffix, which is/are obtained in from ProSe Application Server in step 4. The UE may add additional mask(s) and values for the Suffix part.\nThe optional PC5_tech parameter indicates the PC5 radio technology that may be used for the Discovery Filter(s). When the parameter is omitted the intended PC5 radio technology is E-UTRA.\nNOTE 5:\tWhen the Target RPAUID, corresponding to the ProSe Restricted Code in the Discovery Filter, is included in the Discovery Response message, then the Match Report procedure may be skipped.\nNOTE 6:\tThe ProSe Restricted Code in different Discovery Filters may be the same, for example, when the monitoring user is a friend of the announcing user in more than one application, for which the announcing user was allocated the same ProSe Restricted Code.\n11.\tThe UE obtains the corresponding radio resources that are authorized and configured by the PLMN(s) to be used for ProSe as defined in RAN specifications or uses WLAN, or both and starts to monitor using the Discovery Filter. The UE provides the Application Level Container, which contains the successful authenticated Target RPAUID(s), to the application client.\nNOTE 7:\tThe ProSe Protocol layer in the UE may inform the application client that it has started monitoring.\nIf the TTL corresponding to a Discovery Filter expires (because the UE has not refreshed the corresponding Discovery Request within the duration of the TTL), then the ProSe Function removes the entry related to that Discovery Filter from the UE context.\n5.3.3A\tDiscovery Request - Model B procedures\n5.3.3A.1\tGeneral\nThe Discovery Request is sent by the Discoveree UE or the Discoverer UE in order to be authorised to access the discovery resources and perform restricted ProSe Direct Discovery, Model B.\n5.3.3A.2\tDiscoveree Request (non-roaming) - restricted discovery\nFigure 5.3.3A.2A-1: Discoveree UE procedures for Model B restricted discovery (non-roaming)\n0.\tThe user sets the permission for the restricted discovery using application layer mechanisms. In addition, the application client in the UE retrieves its own PDUID and provides it to the ProSe Application Server. The ProSe Application Server allocates a Restricted ProSe Application User ID (RPAUID) for that PDUID, stores the binding between the PDUID and the RPAUID and returns the RPAUID to the application client in the UE. The UE may optionally provide metadata to be associated with the RPAUID, and the ProSe Application Server stores the metadata. The application client in the UE stores the binding between the PDUID and its own RPAUID. When the application client in the UE intends to use the ProSe service, it triggers the UE to perform a Discoveree request procedure providing its own RPAUID obtained from the ProSe Application Server.\nNOTE 1:\tThe procedures in step 0 are out of scope of 3GPP. However, it is expected that the application client in the UE will be able to retrieve the PDUID from the underlying ProSe Protocol layer.\n1.\tIf the Discoveree UE is authorised to use Model B discovery in the serving PLMN, or if UE intends to use Model B discovery using WLAN-based PC5 and is triggered by the application client to perform a Discoveree Request procedure, the UE shall establish a secure connection to the ProSe Function in the HPLMN and send a Discovery Request (RPAUID, UE Identity, command, Discovery Type, Discovery Model, Application ID, Discovery Entry ID, [PC5_tech]) message. The RPAUID indicates what the UE is interested to announce. The UE Identity is set to IMSI. The command indicates that this is for ProSe Response operation, i.e. for a Discoveree UE. The Discovery Type is set to \"restricted discovery\" and the Discovery Model indicates \"Model B\". The Application ID represents a unique identifier of the UE application that has triggered the transmission of the Discovery Request message. The Discovery Entry ID indicates whether this is a new request. PC5_tech is an optional parameter that indicates the PC5 radio technology (e.g. E-UTRA, WLAN) that UE wishes to use for Model B discovery. PC5_tech may include more than one PC5 radio technology. When this parameter is omitted the intended PC5 radio technology is E-UTRA. This request is always sent to the ProSe Function in HPLMN.\n2.\tThe ProSe Function checks for the authorization of the application represented by the Application ID. If there is no associated UE context, the ProSe Function shall check with HSS the authorisation for discovery and, if necessary, create a new context for this UE that contains the subscription parameters for this UE. The HSS provides the MSISDN of the UE. The HSS also provides the serving PLMN ID of where the UE is registered. When the Discovery Entry ID in the Discovery Request message does not contain a valid value for this UE, the ProSe Function creates a new discovery entry in the UE's context for this request, and returns the corresponding identifier in the Discovery Response message in step 5.\n3.a\tOptionally, the ProSe Function sends an Auth Request (RPAUID, Request Type) to the ProSe Application Server. The ProSe Function locates the ProSe Application Server based on the Application ID. The Request Type is set to \"restricted discovery/response\".\n3.b\tThe ProSe Application Server returns an Auth Response (PDUID(s), Response Type) message. The PDUID(s) corresponds to the RPAUID stored in the ProSe Application Server. The Response Type is set to \"restricted discovery/response ack\". The ProSe Function verifies that at least one of the received PDUID(s) belongs to the requesting UE.\nNOTE 2:\tWhether steps 3.a and 3.b are executed depends on ProSe Function configuration, or policy regarding the specific Application Server. For example, if the ProSe Function can already verify the ownership locally, it does not have to perform the two steps.\n4.\tThe ProSe Function in the HPLMN allocates a ProSe Response Code, a ProSe Query Code, and an associated Discovery Query Filter(s). The ProSe Function also allocates a validity timer that is associated to the ProSe Response Code. The ProSe Response Code corresponds to the RPAUID that was contained in the Discovery Request from the UE. The validity timer shall indicate for how long this ProSe Response Code is going to be valid. The UE will be authorised to respond with this ProSe Response Code for the duration of validity timer and if it remains in the same PLMN. The ProSe Function stores the RPAUID, the ProSe Response Code, the ProSe Query Code and Discovery Query Filter(s), and the associated validity timer in the user context.\n5.\tThe ProSe Function in HPLMN shall respond with a Discovery Response (Discovery Model, ProSe Response Code, Discovery Query Filter(s), validity timer, Discovery Entry ID, [PC5_tech]) message. The Discovery Model indicates that Model B is used. Multiple Discovery Query Filters may be returned. The Discovery Query Filter provides means for the Discoveree UE to determine if a received ProSe Query Code should trigger an announcement of the assigned ProSe Response Code. The ProSe Response Code is provided by the ProSe Function and corresponds to the RPAUID that was contained in the Discovery Request. The validity timer indicates for how long this ProSe Response Code and associated Discovery Query Filter(s) is going to be valid. When the validity timer expires or the UE changes its registered PLMN, the UE needs to initiate a new Discoveree Request procedure. The optional PC5_tech parameter indicates the PC5 radio technology(ies) that is/are authorized to be used for the assigned ProSe Response Code. When this parameter is omitted, the authorized PC5 radio technology is E-UTRA.\n6.\tThe UE may then obtain the radio resources to monitor using the Discovery Query Filter(s), as authorised and configured by E-UTRAN for ProSe as defined in RAN specifications, or uses WLAN or both.\nNOTE 3:\tWhen allowed by authorization configuration, the UE may perform monitoring in Local PLMNs other than the registered PLMN.\nNOTE 4:\tThe ProSe Protocol layer in the UE may inform the application client that it has started monitoring.\nIf the validity timer associated with a ProSe Response Code expires (because the UE has not refreshed the corresponding Discovery Request within the duration of the validity timer), then the ProSe Function removes the entry related to that ProSe Response Code from the UE context.\n5.3.3A.3\tDiscoveree Request (roaming/inter-PLMN transmission) - restricted discovery\nFigure 5.3.3A.3A-1: Discoveree UE procedures for Model B restricted discovery (roaming)\nThe UE is only allowed to announce in the carrier frequency signalled from serving PLMN. When inter-PLMN discovery transmission is supported, the carrier frequency may be operated by Local PLMN.\n0.\tThe user sets the permission for the restricted discovery using application layer mechanisms. In addition, the application client in the UE retrieves its own PDUID and provides it to the ProSe Application Server. The ProSe Application Server allocates a Restricted ProSe Application User ID (RPAUID) for that PDUID, stores the binding between the PDUID and the RPAUID and returns the RPAUID to the application client in the UE. The UE may optionally provide metadata to be associated with the RPAUID, and the ProSe Application Server stores the metadata. The application client in the UE stores the binding between the PDUID and its own RPAUID. When the application client in the UE intends to use the ProSe service, it triggers the UE to perform a Discoveree request procedure providing its own RPAUID obtained from the ProSe Application Server.\nNOTE 1:\tThe procedures in step 0 are out of scope of 3GPP. However, it is expected that the application client in the UE will be able to retrieve the PDUID from the underlying ProSe Protocol layer.\n1.\tIf the Discoveree UE is authorised to use Model B discovery in the PLMN operating the carrier frequency signalled from the serving PLMN (VPLMN or Local PLMN), or if UE intends to use Model B discovery using WLAN-based PC5 and is triggered by the application client to perform a Discoveree Request procedure, the UE shall establish a secure connection to the ProSe Function in the HPLMN and send a Discovery Request (RPAUID, UE Identity, command, Discovery Type, Discovery Model, Application ID, Discovery Entry ID, [Announcing PLMN ID], [PC5_tech]) message. The RPAUID indicates what the UE is interested to announce. The UE Identity is set to IMSI. The command indicates that this is for ProSe Response operation, i.e. for a Discoveree UE. The Discovery Type is set to \"restricted discovery\" and the Discovery Model indicates \"Model B\". The Application ID represents a unique identifier of the UE application that has triggered the transmission of the Discovery Request message. The Discovery Entry ID indicates whether this is a new request. If inter-PLMN ProSe discovery transmission is supported, and the serving PLMN signalled carrier frequency is not operated by HPLMN or VPLMN, the UE shall include the PLMN ID of that carrier frequency in the Announcing PLMN ID. PC5_tech is an optional parameter that indicates the PC5 radio technology (e.g. E-UTRA, WLAN) that UE wishes to use for Model B discovery. PC5_tech may include more than one PC5 radio technology. When this parameter is omitted the intended PC5 radio technology is E-UTRA. This request is always sent to the ProSe Function in HPLMN.\n2.\tThe ProSe Function checks for the authorization of the application represented by the Application ID. If there is no associated UE context, the ProSe Function shall check with HSS the authorisation for discovery and, if necessary, create a new context for this UE that contains the subscription parameters for this UE. The HSS provides the MSISDN of the UE. The HSS also provides the serving PLMN ID of where the UE is registered. When the Discovery Entry ID in the Discovery Request message does not contain a valid value for this UE, the ProSe Function creates a new discovery entry in the UE's context for this request, and returns the corresponding identifier in the Discovery Response message in step 7.\n3.a\tOptionally, the ProSe Function sends an Auth Request (RPAUID, Request Type) to the ProSe Application Server. The ProSe Function locates the ProSe Application Server based on the Application ID. The Request Type is set to \"restricted discovery/response\".\n3.b\tThe ProSe Application Server returns an Auth Response (PDUID(s), Response Type) message. The PDUID(s) corresponds to the RPAUID stored in the ProSe Application Server. The Response Type is set to \"restricted discovery/response ack\". The ProSe Function verifies that at least one of the received PDUID(s) belongs to the requesting UE.\nNOTE 2:\tWhether steps 3.a and 3.b are executed depends on ProSe Function configuration, or policy regarding the specific Application Server. For example, if the ProSe Function can already verify the ownership locally, it does not have to perform the two steps.\n4.\tThe ProSe Function in the HPLMN allocates a ProSe Response Code, a ProSe Query Code, and an associated Discovery Query Filter(s). The ProSe Function also allocates a validity timer that is associated to the ProSe Response Code. The ProSe Response Code corresponds to the RPAUID that was contained in the Discovery Request from the UE. The validity timer shall indicate for how long this ProSe Response Code is going to be valid. The UE will be authorised to respond with this ProSe Response Code for the duration of validity timer and if it remains in the same PLMN. The ProSe Function stores the RPAUID, the ProSe Response Code, the ProSe Query Code, and Discovery Query Filter(s), and the associated validity timer in the user context.\n5.\tIf the Discovery Request is authorised then the ProSe Function in the HPLMN shall inform the ProSe Function in VPLMN or Local PLMN with the Announce Authorisation (Restricted ProSe Application User ID, Application ID, ProSe Response Code, validity timer, UE Identity, Discovery Entry ID, [PC5_tech]) message. The Restricted ProSe Application User ID corresponds to the request from the UE, whereas the ProSe Response Code indicates the assigned code for this request. The request also includes the UE identity information e.g. IMSI or MSISDN in order to allow the ProSe Function in VPLMN or Local PLMN to perform charging. The validity timer indicates for how long this ProSe Response Code is going to be valid. If the ProSe Function in VPLMN or Local PLMN receives the same Discovery Entry ID in a subsequent Announce Authorization message, it updates the discoveree UE's corresponding discovery entry replacing the existing ProSe Response Code and validity timer with the last received ones. The request may also include the PC5_tech parameter if it was provided by the UE in step 1. When this parameter is omitted the intended PC5 radio technology is E-UTRA.\nNOTE 3:\tThe information provided in step 5 that is related to charging is used only when the requested PC5 radio technology includes E-UTRA.\n6.\tThe ProSe Function in VPLMN or Local PLMN authorizes the UE to perform ProSe Direct Discovery announcing.\n7.\tThe ProSe Function in HPLMN shall respond with a Discovery Response (Discovery Model, ProSe Response Code, Discovery Query Filter(s), validity timer, Discovery Entry ID, [PC5_tech]) message. The Discovery Model indicates that Model B is used. Multiple Discovery Query Filters may be returned. The Discovery Query Filter provides means for the Discoveree UE to determine if a received ProSe Query Code should trigger an announcement of the assigned ProSe Response Code. The ProSe Response Code is provided by the ProSe Function and corresponds to the Restricted ProSe Application User ID that was contained in the Discovery Request. The validity timer indicates for how long this ProSe Response Code and associated Discovery Query Filter(s) is going to be valid. When the validity timer expires or the UE changes its registered PLMN, the UE needs to UE needs to initiate a new Discoveree Request procedure. The optional PC5_tech parameter indicates the PC5 radio technology(ies) that is/are authorized to be used for the assigned ProSe Response Code. When this parameter is omitted, the authorized PC5 radio technology is E-UTRA.\n8.\tThe UE may then obtain the radio resources to monitor using the Discovery Query Filter, as authorised and configured by E-UTRAN for ProSe as defined in RAN specifications, or uses WLAN or both.\nNOTE 4:\tWhen allowed by authorization configuration, the UE may perform monitoring in Local PLMNs other than the registered PLMN\nNOTE 5:\tThe ProSe Protocol layer in the UE may inform the application client that it has started monitoring.\nIf the validity timer associated with a ProSe Response Code expires (because the UE has not refreshed the corresponding Discovery Request within the duration of the validity timer), then the ProSe Function removes the entry related to that ProSe Response Code from the UE context.\n5.3.3A.4\tDiscoverer Request (non-roaming) - restricted discovery\nFigure 5.3.3A.4A-1: Discoverer UE procedures for Model B restricted discovery (non-roaming)\n0.\tIn this step, the application client in the UE retrieves its own PDUID and provides it to the ProSe Application Server. The ProSe Application Server allocates a Restricted ProSe Application User ID (RPAUID) for that PDUID, stores the binding between the PDUID and the RPAUID and returns the RPAUID to the application client in the UE. The application client in the UE stores the binding between the PDUID and its own RPAUID, obtains the RPAUID of those users (Target RPAUIDs) from the ProSe Application Server and triggers the UE to perform the ProSe query procedure, providing its own RPAUID and the Target RPAUIDs. The Target RPAUIDs of the UEs to be queried are passed in an Application Level Container.\nNOTE 1:\tThe procedures in step 0 are out of scope of 3GPP. However, it is expected that the application client in the UE will be able to retrieve the PDUID from the underlying ProSe Protocol layer.\n1.\tIf the Discoverer UE is authorised to use Model B discovery in the serving PLMN, or if UE intends to use Model B discovery using WLAN-based PC5 and is triggered by the application client to perform a Discoverer Request procedure, the UE shall establish a secure connection to the ProSe Function in the HPLMN and send a Discovery Request (RPAUID, UE Identity, command, Discovery Type, Discovery Model, Application ID, Application Transparent Container, Discovery Entry ID, [PC5_tech]) message. The RPAUID indicates what the UE is interested to announce. The UE Identity is set to IMSI. The command indicates that this is for a ProSe Query operation, i.e. for a Discoverer UE. The Discovery Type is set to \"restricted discovery\" and the Discovery Model indicates \"Model B\". The Application ID represents a unique identifier of the UE application that has triggered the transmission of the Discovery Request message. The Discovery Entry ID indicates whether this is a new request. PC5_tech is an optional parameter that indicates the PC5 radio technology (e.g. E-UTRA, WLAN) that UE wishes to use for Model B discovery. PC5_tech may include more than one PC5 radio technology. When this parameter is omitted the intended PC5 radio technology is E-UTRA. This request is always sent to the ProSe Function in HPLMN.\n2.\tThe ProSe Function checks for the authorization of the application represented by the Application ID. If there is no associated UE context, the ProSe Function shall check with HSS the authorisation for discovery and, if necessary, create a new context for this UE that contains the subscription parameters for this UE. The HSS provides the MSISDN of the UE. The HSS also provides the serving PLMN ID of where the UE is registered. When the Discovery Entry ID in the Discovery Request message does not contain a valid value for this UE, the ProSe Function creates a new discovery entry in the UE's context for this request, and returns the corresponding identifier in the Discovery Response message in step 8.\n3.a\tThe ProSe Function sends an Auth Request (RPAUID, Request Type, Application Level Container) to the ProSe Application Server. The ProSe Function locates the ProSe Application Server based on the Application ID. The Request Type is set to \"restricted discovery/query\".\n3.b\tIf, based on the permission setting, the RPAUID is allowed to discover at least one of the Target RPAUID(s) contained in the Application Level Container, the ProSe Application Server returns an Auth Response (PDUID, Response Type, N sets of Target PDUID - Target RPAUID) message. The PDUID corresponds to the RPAUID stored in the ProSe Application Server. The Response Type is set to \"restricted discovery/query ack\". Each Target ProSe Discovery UE ID is returned with the corresponding Target RPAUID that the RPAUID is allowed to discover. The ProSe Function verifies that the received PDUID belongs to the requesting UE.\nStep 4 is executed only when the PLMN ID in the Target ProSe Discovery UE ID indicates the HPLMN.\n4.\tIf the PLMN ID in the Target PDUID indicates the HPLMN and at least one of received pair of Target PDUID - Target RPAUID corresponds to a valid ProSe Response Code including a valid PC5 radio technology match as indicated via the PC5_tech parameter in step 1, the ProSe Function locates the Discoveree UE(s) context. The ProSe Function in the HPLMN retrieves the ProSe Query Code and an associated validity timer. The ProSe Query Code is the code used by the ProSe Function to build the Discovery Query Filter of step 4 of clause 5.3.3A.2, such that it can trigger the Discoveree UE to send the response. The ProSe Function allocates a Discovery Response Filter(s) based on the ProSe Response Code. The ProSe Response Code is that allocated to the Discoveree UE in step 4 of clause 5.3.3A.2. The validity timer indicates for how long a ProSe Query Code and ProSe Response Code are going to be valid.\nSteps 5-7 are executed only when the PLMN ID in the Target ProSe Discovery UE ID indicates a different HPLMN.\n5.\tIf the Discovery Request is authorized, and the PLMN ID in the Target ProSe Discovery UE ID indicates a different PLMN, the ProSe Function contacts the ProSe Function of the indicated PLMN(s) to obtain the necessary information with a Discovery Request (Restricted ProSe App User ID, UE Identity, Target ProSe Discovery UE ID, Application ID, Target Restricted ProSe App User ID, Discovery Entry ID, [PC5_tech]). If the ProSe Function in other PLMN receives the same Discovery Entry ID in a subsequent Discovery Request message, it updates the discoverer UE's corresponding discovery entry with the received corresponding parameters. The request may also include the PC5_tech parameter if it was provided by the UE in step 1. When this parameter is omitted the intended PC5 radio technology is E-UTRA.\n6.a\tOptionally, the ProSe Function in the other PLMN sends an Auth Request (RPAUID, Request Type, Target RPAUID) to the Application Server indicated by the Application ID. The request type is set to \"restricted discovery/query\".\n6.b\tIf, based on the permission setting, the RPAUID is allowed to discover at least one of the Target RPAUID(s), the ProSe Application Server returns an Auth Response (PDUID, response type, Target PDUID) message. The PDUID corresponds to the RPAUID stored in the ProSe Application Server. The response type is set to \"restricted discovery/query ack\". The ProSe Function in the other PLMN verifies that the received PDUID belongs to the UE to be discovered.\nNOTE 2:\tWhether steps 6.a and 6.b are executed depends on ProSe Function configuration, or policy regarding the specific Application Server. For example, if the ProSe Function can verify the permission locally, or the HPLMN is trusted by the other PLMNs for permission control, these steps are not needed.\n7.\tBased on the Target ProSe Discovery UE ID, Application ID, and Target Restricted ProSe App User ID, the ProSe Function locates the Discoveree UE(s) context, and responds with a Discovery Response (ProSe Query Code(s), ProSe Response Code, validity timer, [PC5_tech]). The ProSe Query Code is the code used by the ProSe Function to build the Discovery Query Filter of step 4 of clause 5.3.3A.2, such that it can trigger the Discoveree UE to send the response. The ProSe Response Code is that allocated to the Discoveree UE in step 4 of clause 5.3.3A.2. The validity timer indicates for how long a ProSe Query Code and ProSe Response Code are going to be valid. The optional PC5_tech parameter indicates the PC5 radio technology(ies) that is/are authorized to be used for the assigned ProSe Query Code. When this parameter is omitted, the authorized PC5 radio technology is E-UTRA.\n8.\tThe ProSe Function in the HPLMN shall respond with a Discovery Response (Discovery Model, ProSe Query Code(s), Discovery Response Filter(s) validity timer, [PC5_tech]) message. The Discovery Model indicates the Model B is used. Multiple Discovery Response Filters may be returned. The Discovery Response Filter is generated by the ProSe Function based on the ProSe Response Code of step 4 or received in step 7. The ProSe Query Code is that of step 4 or is received in step 7. The validity timer indicates for how long a ProSe Query Code and corresponding Discovery Response Filter(s) are going to be valid. When the validity timer expires the UE needs to UE needs to initiate a new Discoverer Request procedure. The optional PC5_tech parameter indicates the PC5 radio technology(ies) that is/are authorized to be used for the assigned ProSe Query Code. When this parameter is omitted, the authorized PC5 radio technology is E-UTRA.\n9.\tThe UE may then obtain the radio resources to announce the ProSe Query Code, as authorised and configured by E-UTRAN for ProSe as defined in RAN specifications, or uses WLAN or both.\nNOTE 3:\tThe ProSe Protocol layer in the UE may inform the application client that it has started announcing. This is out of scope of 3GPP.\nIf the validity timer associated with a ProSe Query Code expires (because the UE has not refreshed the corresponding Discovery Request within the duration of the validity timer), then the ProSe Function removes the entry related to that ProSe Query Code from the UE context.\n5.3.3A.5\tDiscoverer request (roaming/inter-PLMN transmission) - restricted discovery\nFigure 5.3.3A.5A-1: Discoverer UE procedures for Model B restricted discovery (roaming)\nThe UE is only allowed to announce in the carrier frequency signalled from serving PLMN. When inter-PLMN discovery transmission is supported, the carrier frequency may be operated by Local PLMN.\n0.\tIn this step, the application client in the UE retrieves its own PDUID and provides it to the ProSe Application Server. The ProSe Application Server allocates a Restricted ProSe Application User ID (RPAUID) for that PDUID, stores the binding between the PDUID and the RPAUID and returns the RPAUID to the application client in the UE. The application client in the UE stores the binding between the PDUID and its own RPAUID. When the application client in the UE intends to query a UE of other users (e.g. friends in the application), it obtains the RPAUID of those users (Target RPAUIDs) from the ProSe Application Server and triggers the UE to perform the ProSe query procedure, providing its own RPAUID and the Target RPAUIDs. The Target RPAUIDs of the UEs to be queried are passed in an Application Level Container.\nNOTE 1:\tThe procedures in step 0 are out of scope of 3GPP. However, it is expected that the application client in the UE will be able to retrieve the PDUID from the underlying ProSe Protocol layer.\n1.\tIf the Discoverer UE is authorised to use Model B discovery in the PLMN operating the carrier frequency signalled by the serving PLMN, or if UE intends to use Model B discovery using WLAN-based PC5 and is triggered by the application client to perform a Discoverer Request procedure, the UE shall establish a secure connection to the ProSe Function in the HPLMN and send a Discovery Request (RPAUID, UE Identity, command, Discovery Type, Discovery Model, Application ID, Application Transparent Container, Discovery Entry ID, [Announcing PLMN ID], [PC5_tech]) message. The RPAUID indicates what the UE is interested to announce. The UE Identity is set to IMSI. The command indicates that this is for a ProSe Query operation, i.e. for a Discoverer UE. The Discovery Type is set to \"restricted discovery\" and the Discovery Model indicates \"Model B\". The Application ID represents a unique identifier of the UE application that has triggered the transmission of the Discovery Request message. The Discovery Entry ID indicates whether this is a new request. If inter-PLMN ProSe discovery transmission is supported, and the serving PLMN signalled carrier frequency is not operated by HPLMN or VPLMN, the UE shall include the PLMN ID of that carrier frequency in the Announcing PLMN ID. PC5_tech is an optional parameter that indicates the PC5 radio technology (e.g. E-UTRA, WLAN) that UE wishes to use for Model B discovery. PC5_tech may include more than one PC5 radio technology. When this parameter is omitted the intended PC5 radio technology is E-UTRA. This request is always sent to the ProSe Function in HPLMN.\n2.\tThe ProSe Function checks for the authorization of the application represented by the Application ID. If there is no associated UE context, the ProSe Function shall check with HSS the authorisation for discovery and, if necessary, create a new context for this UE that contains the subscription parameters for this UE. The HSS provides the MSISDN of the UE. The HSS also provides the serving PLMN ID of where the UE is registered. When the Discovery Entry ID in the Discovery Request message does not contain a valid value for this UE, the ProSe Function creates a new discovery entry in the UE's context for this request, and returns the corresponding identifier in the Discovery Response message in step 10.\n3.a\tThe ProSe Function sends an Auth Request (RPAUID, Request Type, Application Level Container) to the ProSe Application Server. The ProSe Function locates the ProSe Application Server based on the Application ID.

The ProSe Function in the HPLMN retrieves the ProSe Query Code and an associated validity timer. The ProSe Query Code is the code used by the ProSe Function to build the Discovery Query Filter of step 4 of clause 5.3.3A.3, such that it can trigger the Discoveree UE to send the response. The ProSe Function allocates a Discovery Response Filter(s) based on the ProSe Response Code. The ProSe Response Code is that allocated to the Discoveree UE in step 4 of clause 5.3.3A.3.

time to change the discovery permissions relating to other users in a ProSe Application Server.\nFor example user A, while announcing the ProSe Restricted Code for a given Application ID, may revoke the permission to be discovered by users B and C. However, changes in the discovery permissions will not be effective until the validity timer associated to the corresponding ProSe Restricted Code expires. In order to avoid such a delay, the procedure in clause 5.3.6A.2.2 is triggered by the ProSe Application Server towards the ProSe Function serving user A.\nNOTE:\tIf users A and C are de-authorised to discover each other in a given application, the corresponding ProSe Application Server triggers the procedure in clause 5.3.6A.2.2 or that in clause 5.3.6A.2.3 towards the affected ProSe Functions, e.g. those of user A and user C.\n5.3.6A.2.2\tRevocation of Discovery Filters\nFigure 5.3.6A.2.2-1: Revocation of Discovery Filters for restricted discovery (roaming or non-roaming)\n0.\tUser A, while announcing the ProSe Restricted Code for a given Application ID, revokes discovery permissions relating to some other users in the ProSe Application Server.\n1.\tThe ProSe Application Server sends to the ProSe Function serving user A (identified by checking the PDUID of user A) an Authorization Update (RPAUID, Request Type, N sets of Banned RPAUID - Banned PDUID) message. ProSe Function identifies user A based on the RPAUID and the Application ID associated with the ProSe Application Server. The Request Type is set to \"restricted discovery/monitor nack\". The N sets of Banned RPAUID - Banned PDUID are those that are no longer allowed to discover the ProSe Restricted Code corresponding to user A's RPAUID for the Application ID associated with that ProSe Application Server.\n2.\tThe ProSe Function serving user A acknowledges the Authorization Update message.\n3.\tThe ProSe Function serving user A analyses the received N sets of Banned RPAUID - Banned PDUID.\nSteps 4 - 5 are executed only for the (sub)set of Banned PDUIDs whose PLMN ID is the same PLMN ID of the PDUID associated with the RPAUID of user A (e.g. UE of user B).\n4.\tIf the ProSe Function serving user A has previously allocated to a Banned RPAUID - Banned ProSe Discovery UE (e.g. user B) a Discovery Filter for monitoring the ProSe Restricted Code corresponding to the RPAUID and Application ID of user A, then the ProSe Function shall send a Discovery Update Request (UE Identity, Discovery Entry ID, Update Info) message to that UE (e.g. UE of user B). The UE identity is set to the IMSI of the UE. The Discovery Entry ID is set to the identifier of the corresponding Discovery Entry that contains the Discovery Filter to be revoked. The Update Info is optional and contains Discovery Filter(s) to replace the existing one(s), if the ProSe Function decides to remove only certain filter(s) and not others. If the Update Info is not included, the UE shall remove all the Discovery Filters corresponding to the Discovery Entry ID.\n5.\tThe UE locates each Discovery Filter to be revoked, associated with the Discovery Entry ID, removes it from the ProSe Discovery services operation and sends back to the ProSe Function a Discovery Update Ack (Result, Discovery Entry ID) message to confirm the corresponding operation.\nSteps 6 - 11 are executed only for the (sub)set of Banned PDUIDs whose PLMN ID is different from the PLMN ID of the PDUID associated with the RPAUID of user A (e.g. UE of user C).\n6.\tIf the ProSe Function serving user A has previously answered to a Monitor Request coming from a ProSe Function in the PLMN of a Banned PDUID, related to a Banned RPAUID (e.g. user C), then the ProSe Function serving user A sends to that ProSe Function a Monitor Update (ProSe Restricted Code, Application ID, Banned RPAUID, Banned PDUID) message. The ProSe Restricted Code is the code the UE of user A is announcing and for which is requested the revocation of the corresponding Discovery Filter. The Banned RPAUID and Banned PDUID identify the UE that is using the Discovery Filter to be revoked (e.g. UE of user C).\n7.\tThe ProSe Function in the other PLMN acknowledges the Monitor Update message.\n8.\tUpon receiving the ProSe Function a Monitor Update, the ProSe Function in the other PLMN shall send a Discovery Update Request (UE Identity, Discovery Entry ID, Update Info) message to that UE (e.g. UE of user C). The UE identity is set to IMSI of the UE. The Discovery Entry ID is set to the identifier of the corresponding Discovery Entry that contains the Discovery Filter to be revoked. The Update Info is optional and contains Discovery Filter(s) to replace the existing one(s), if the ProSe Function decides to remove only certain filter(s) and not others. If the Update Info is not included, the UE shall remove all the Discovery Filters corresponding to the Discovery Entry ID.\n9.\tThe UE locates each Discovery Filter to be revoked, associated with the Discovery Entry ID, removes it from the ProSe Discovery services operation and sends back to the ProSe Function a Discovery Update Ack (Result, Discovery Entry ID) message to confirm the corresponding operation.\n10.\tAfter a time configured by the operator the ProSe Function in the other PLMN sends a Monitor Update Result (ProSe Restricted Code, Application ID, Banned RPAUID, Banned ProSe Discovery UE ID, Result) message to the ProSe Function serving user A to report the result of the corresponding operation.\n11.\tThe ProSe Function serving user A acknowledges the Monitor Update Result message.\n12.\tAfter a time configured by the operator, the ProSe Function serving user A sends an Authorization Update Result (RPAUID, Request Type, N sets of Banned RPAUID - Banned PDUID with Result) message to the ProSe Application Server. The sets Banned RPAUID - Banned PDUID are those received from the ProSe Application Server in step 1. For each set, the Result indicates whether the permission to discover the ProSe Restricted Code corresponding to user A RPAUID for the Application ID specific of that ProSe Application Server has been successfully revoked or not.\n13.\tThe ProSe Application Server acknowledges the Authorization Update Result message.\n5.3.6A.2.3\tAllocation of a new ProSe Restricted Code and update of Discovery Filters\nBased on local policies the ProSe Function serving user A may decide that in certain scenarios it is more convenient to allocate a new ProSe Restricted Code to the user A and provide new corresponding Discovery Filters to the monitoring UEs that are still allowed to perform discovery of user A (e.g. UE of user D), rather than revoking the Discovery Filters from the monitoring UEs whose discovery permissions for user A have been revoked.\nIn such case the procedure is executed as shown in Figure 5.3.6A.2.3-1.\nFigure 5.3.6A.2.3-1: Allocation of a new ProSe Restricted Code and update of Discovery Filters\nSteps 0 - 3 are the same as in clause 5.3.6A.2.2.\n4.\tAs step 3 in clause 5.3.3.2A and 5.3.3.3A with the following change: the ProSe Function stores the new ProSe Restricted Code and the associated validity timer in the user context and removes the old ProSe Restricted Code.\nSteps 5 and 6 are executed only when the UE of user A is roaming.\n5.\tAs step 4 in clause 5.3.3.3A.\n6.\tAs step 5 in clause 5.3.3.3A.\n7.\tThe ProSe Function serving user A sends a Discovery Update Request (UE Identity, Discovery Entry ID, Update Info) message to the UE of user A. The UE identity is set to IMSI of the UE. The Discovery Entry ID is set to the identifier of the corresponding Discovery Entry that contains the ProSe Restricted Code to be replaced. The Update Info contains the new ProSe Restricted Code and the associated validity timer that should be used.\n8.\tThe UE locates the ProSe Restricted Code to be replaced, associated with the Discovery Entry ID, replaces it and sends back to the ProSe Function a Discovery Update Ack (Result, Discovery Entry ID) message to confirm the corresponding operation.\n9.\tIf the Discovery Filters for monitoring the ProSe Restricted Code corresponding to the RPAUID and Application ID of user A has been previously allocated to a Target RPAUID - Target ProSe Disc UE still allowed to discover user A (e.g. user D), then those monitoring UEs are updated as described in figure 5.3.6A.2.2-1, with the following changes: the newly allocated ProSe Restricted Code and validity timer are additionally delivered to the ProSe Function(s) serving the monitoring UEs (e.g. user D) by the Monitor Update message, and are used by the ProSe Function(s) to build the new Discovery Filters that were conveyed in the Update Info information element of the Discovery Update Request messages, and are used by the monitoring UEs to replace the old Discovery Filters. The ProSe Application Server is finally updated with the results of the overall procedure.",

      "content": "The following procedure illustrated in Figure 5.4.4.4-1 is used by a ProSe-enabled Public safety UE to request a ProSe UE-to-Network Relay to start monitoring a specific TMGI availability and that the ProSe UE-to-Network Relay broadcasts this TMGI and its corresponding ProSe Layer-2 Group ID by using Relay Discovery Additional Information sent on the discovery transport, when it is detected on the MCCH of the serving cell. The eMBMS traffic related to this TMGI, if available, is also forwarded to the remote UE's served by the relay over a one-to-many link identified by a specific ProSe Layer-2 Group ID provided by the Relay when the procedure is executed.\nFigure 5.4.4.4-1: TMGI monitoring request procedure\n1.\tThe UE has successfully discovered the ProSe UE-to-Network Relay and has obtained (perhaps after a one to one communication sessions with the relay) from a Group communication application the related service description that contains the TMGI, QCI, radio frequencies, and MBMS SAIs the UE should use to receive related eMBMS content. This interaction can happen before or after the UE has joined the relay. The application layer in the UE sets the ProSe Per-Packet Priority associated with the TMGI.\n2.\tThe UE sends to the ProSe UE-to-Network Relay a TMGI Monitoring Request (TMGI, MBMS SAIs, ProSe Per-Packet Priority) where the TMGI value, MBMS SAIs and ProSe Per-Packet Priority are obtained at step 1.\nNOTE 1:\tThe UE sends to the ProSe UE-to-Network Relay a TMGI Monitoring Request message even if it has already known the ProSe Layer-2 Group ID for the corresponding TMGI.\n3.\tThe ProSe UE-to-Network Relay retrieves the list of MBMS SAIs from the system information of the cell camped on as specified in TS 36.331 [33] and checks whether at least one of the MBMS SAIs obtained at step 2 is included in the MBMS SAI list.\n4.\tIf the ProSe UE-to-Network Relay detects at least one of the request MBMS SAIs, the ProSe UE-to-Network Relay acknowledges the request with a TMGI Monitoring Response ( ProSe Layer 2 Group ID, TMGI_Monitoring_Refresh Timer, SAI indicator = true). The ProSe Layer 2 Group ID is used to forward to Remote UEs the eMBMS content related to the TMGI value received at step 2. The TMGI_Monitoring_Refresh Timer (configurable in the ProSe UE-to-Network Relay) is provided to the UE so that when this timer elapses the UE shall execute the TMGI monitoring request procedure if it still needs to monitor the TMGI. If a UE does not execute the TMGI Monitoring Request procedure when this TMGI_Monitoring_Refresh Timer expires in the UE and no other UE executes the refresh procedure for this TMGI, then when the TMGI_Monitoring_Refresh Timer for the TMGI expires in the relay, the relay shall stop monitoring the TMGI and also to forward any related content if it was doing so. If the ProSe UE-to-Network Relay is not in the coverage of any requested SAIs, the SAI indicator is set to false and the ProSe UE-to-Network Relay remains monitoring the TMGI until the TMGI_Monitoring_Refresh Timer expires. It is assumed that bearer level security is not applied to PC5 ProSe one-to-may link for MBMS traffic relay.\n5.\tThe ProSe UE-to-Network Relay detects the TMGI it has been requested to monitor.\nNOTE 2:\tThe action applicable when the UE is unable to simultaneously receive eMBMS and unicast services (e.g. eMBMS and unicast services use different frequencies) is up to UE implementation.\n6.\tUpon detection of the TMGI, the ProSe UE-to-Network Relay broadcasts availability of the TMGI and the corresponding ProSe Layer 2 Group ID by sending a Relay Discovery Additional Information Message (TMGI, ProSe Layer 2 Group ID) as defined in clause 4.6.4.10. This is repeated with a configurable (in the ProSe UE to Network Relay) repetition interval which should normally be smaller than the TMGI_Monitoring_Refresh Timer. The value of the TMGI may be used by devices discovering the UE-to-Network Relay as a preference criterion for Relay selection, if they are interested in the TMGI the relay is advertising.\n7.\tThe UE detects the announcement of step 6 and subsequently starts to receive the broadcast content on the PC5 ProSe one-to-many link associated to the Prose Layer-2 Group ID defined at step 4, and may request to release unicast distribution leg if any was being used. The ProSe UE-to-Network Relay applies the received ProSe Per-Packet Priority value in step 2 to transmit the eMBMS traffic over the PC5 interface. For a given TMGI, if different ProSe Per-Packet Priority values are received from different UEs, the ProSe Per-Packet Priority that the UE-to-Network Relay determines to use for transmitting the eMBMS data associated with the TMGI is up to UE implementation.\nNOTE 3:\tThe UE belonging to an announced TMGI may receive the relayed eMBMS traffic via ProSe Layer-2 Group ID even if the UE does not yet complete the TMGI monitoring request/response procedure.\n8.\tUpon detection of loss of TMGI, the ProSe UE-to-Network Relay stops broadcasting availability of the TMGI. Optionally, it also sends a positive indication of loss of TMGI so as to accelerate loss of TMGI detection in the UE (not shown in the procedure). The UE may request a unicast distribution leg from the GCS AS.\n9.\tThe UE stops receiving the broadcast content on the PC5 ProSe one-to-many link associated to the Prose Layer Group-2 ID defined at step 4.\nNOTE 4:\tThe relative ordering between step 8 and 9 may be dependent on when the eMBMS content becomes unavailable in the cell.",

SUPL Config is a set of parameters that enable ProSe Function B to configure SUPL reporting in UE B using the '\"Inside\" Trigger with Repeated Reporting' as defined in OMA AD SUPL [2].\n5.\tBased on EPUID_B received in the previous step, ProSe Function B retrieves subscriber B's record. ProSe Function B may request UE B's last known location via the HSS (step 5a). Based on the last known location of UE B obtained via the HSS and UE A's location and time window provided by ProSe Function A in step 4, ProSe Function B may determine that the users are unlikely to enter proximity within the requested time window and rejects the request by sending a Proximity Request Reject message towards UE A with an appropriate cause value (steps 5b and 5c), in which case the remaining steps of the procedure are skipped.\n6.\tDepending on UE B's ProSe profile, UE B may be asked to confirm permission for the proximity request (e.g. user B may have temporarily disabled the ProSe function on UE B).\n7.\tProSe Function B requests location reporting on UE B from SLP B and acknowledges the proximity request to ProSe Function A and provides UE B's current location (if known). The WLAN Link Layer ID of UE B (WLLID_B) is included if UE A has requested EPC support for WLAN direct discovery and communication in step 1 and if UE B uses a permanent WLAN Link Layer ID.\n8.\tProSe Function A requests location reporting on UE A from SLP A. If UE A's current location is available and if UE B's location was included in step 7, ProSe Function A may decide to cancel the Proximity Request procedure if it determines that the UEs are unlikely to enter proximity within the requested time window. Otherwise ProSe Function A acknowledges the proximity request to UE A.",

The Assistance Information content depends on the WLAN technology.\nA.2\tWi-Fi Peer-to-Peer\nWi-Fi Peer-to-Peer (P2P) specification [13] defines an architecture and set of protocols that facilitate direct discovery and communication using the IEEE 802.11 technology [14].\nTo assist WLAN direct discovery and communication as required by the Wi-Fi P2P technology [13] the EPC needs to supply some or all of the following items as part of the Assistance Information:\n-\tSSID: The SSID to use for Wi-Fi P2P operation. To be compliant with the Wi-Fi P2P specification [13] the SSID should be in the form \"DIRECT-ab\" where a, b are two random characters.\n-\tWLAN Secret Key: The pre-shared key to be used by UEs to secure their Wi-Fi P2P communication. This is used by UEs as the Pairwise Master Key (PMK).\n-\tGroup Owner indication: If set, the UE should implement the Group Owner (GO) functionality specified in the Wi-Fi P2P specification [13]. The UE implementing this functionality essentially becomes an AP that transmits Beacons with the P2P Information Element and accepts associations from other Wi-Fi P2P devices or from legacy Wi-Fi devices (those not implementing the Wi-Fi P2P functionality). If not set, the UE should behave as a Wi-Fi P2P client that attempts to discover and associate with a GO.\n-\tP2P Device Address of self: This is the WLAN Link Layer ID to be used by a UE when participating in a Wi-Fi P2P group.\n-\tP2P Device Address of peers: This is a list of WLAN Link Layer IDs provided to a UE implementing the Group Owner functionality in a Wi-Fi P2P group. Such UEs should accept WLAN association requests only from devices that are included in this list.\n-\tOperation channel: The channel on which Wi-Fi P2P discovery and communication should take place.\n-\tValidity time: The time period during which the content provided in the assistance information is valid.\nAnnex B (informative):Wild carded ProSe Application IDs\nB.1\tGeneral\nThe wildcard indicator, in the MNC or MCC part of the PLMN ID of the ProSe Application ID indicates whether this particular ProSe Application ID is PLMN specific (in which case neither MCC nor MNC will be wild carded) or countrywide (in which case the MNC part will be wild-carded) or global (in which case both the MCC and MNC parts will be wild-carded).\nCountrywide or global ProSe Application IDs belong in different data structures that are managed by \"authorities\" not associated with a specific PLMN.\nNotwithstanding the description in this annex, showing both PLMN specific and country-wide or global data structures, this does not preclude that in the future the country-wide or global data structures may supersede the PLMN specific data structures.\nFigure B.1-1: Country-wide, global and PLMN specific ProSe Application IDs\nThis arrangement between the PLMN and the \"authority\" that allocates these ProSe Application IDs is out of scope of 3GPP in this release of the specification.\nNOTE:\tThe interfaces between the ProSe Functions and the repositories of global or country-wide ProSe Application IDs/ProSe Application Codes that are shown in figure B.1-1 is out of scope of 3GPP in this Release.\nB.2\tUse of wild-carded ProSe Application IDs\nThe monitoring or announcing UE can request to monitor or announce a ProSe Application Code that has countrywide or global scope following the procedures defined in clause 5.3.3 by wildcarding accordingly the MNC element of the PLMN ID of the ProSe Application ID (for countrywide) or both the MCC and MNC (for global) elements of the PLMN ID of the ProSe Application ID.\nThe monitoring UE will have to know whether to send a monitoring request for PLMN specific, or countrywide, or global ProSe Application ID, based on the configuration that applies to the particular data structure.\nIf country-wide or global data structures are used then PC6 and PC7 interfaces are not used for monitoring requests.\nFor example if the UE is interested to monitor or announce for restaurants that are registered in a configured PLMN specific data structure (e.g., local restaurants in a particular geographical area) it will send a monitoring request that contains only the following PLMN specific ProSe Application ID. If on the other hand the UE is interested to monitor or announce for restaurants that are registered in the configured global data structure (e.g., chain restaurants present in several countries/available all over the world) it will send a monitoring or announcing request that contains only the global ProSe Application ID. The monitoring UE can also send multiple ProSe Application IDs with different scope in the same request, but overall it should not be considered that one ProSe Application ID replaces the other.\nAnnex C (normative):WLAN-based ProSe Direct Discovery\nC.1\tGeneral\nThis Annex provides examples of how the WLAN technologies can be used in ProSe Direct Discovery for transport of the ProSe Protocol messages and/or information elements. The WLAN-based transport depends on the underlying WLAN technology.\nC.2\tWi-Fi Neighbor Awareness Networking (NAN)\nWi-Fi Neighbor Awareness Networking (NAN) specification [38] defines an architecture and set of protocols that facilitate direct discovery and communication using the IEEE 802.11 [14] technology.\nFigure C.2-1 shows the high-level architecture of a NAN Device.\nFigure C.2-1: NAN Device Architecture (after Wi-Fi Neighbor Awareness Networking (NAN) specification [38])\nWhen a ProSe-enabled UE uses the Wi-Fi NAN technology in ProSe Direct Discovery, the ProSe Protocol layer acts as one of the applications shown in Figure C.2-1 and interacts with the underlying NAN Discovery Engine through a logical interface that is described in terms of method and event primitives in the NAN Wi-Fi Neighbor Awareness Networking (NAN) specification [38].\nThe PC5_DISCOVERY message, specified in TS 24.334 [24], is passed by means of the \"Publish\" method from the ProSe Protocol layer to the NAN Discovery Engine and inserted in the Service Descriptor Attribute (see Wi-Fi Neighbor Awareness Networking (NAN) specification [38]).\nThe content of the Service Descriptor Attribute is illustrated in Table C.2-1. The table also indicates how the individual fields of the Service Descriptor Attribute are used for transport of the PC5_DISCOVERY message.\nTable C.2-1: Service Descriptor Attribute Format (defined in Wi-Fi Neighbor Awareness Networking (NAN) specification [38]) and 3GPP-specific settings for ProSe\nField\nDescription\n3GPP-specific setting\nAttribute ID\nIdentifies the type of NAN attribute\nLength\nLength of the following fields in the attribute.\nService ID\nMandatory field that contains the hash of the Service Name.\nAlways set to a 3GPP-defined Service Category for ProSe(1)\nInstance ID\nPublish_ID or Subscribe_ID\nRequestor Instance ID\nInstance ID from the frame that triggered the transmission if available, otherwise set to 0x00.\nService Control\nMandatory field that defines the Service Control bitmap as defined in Table 5 11 of Wi-Fi Neighbor Awareness Networking (NAN) specification [38].\nAlways set to \"00: Publish\"\nBinding Bitmap\nOptional field that indicates the binding of the SDA to post discovery connection attributes\nNot used for ProSe Direct Discovery\nMatching Filter Length\nAn optional field and present if a matching service discovery filter is used\nNot used for ProSe Direct Discovery\nMatching Filter\nAn optional field that is a sequence of length and value pairs that identify the matching service discovery filters, as defined in Wi-Fi Neighbor Awareness Networking (NAN) specification 38]\nNot used for ProSe Direct Discovery\nService Response Filter Length\nAn optional field and present if a service response filter is used.\nNot used for ProSe Direct Discovery\nService Response Filter\nAn optional field that identifies the matching service response filters, refer to Table 5 13 of Wi-Fi Neighbor Awareness Networking (NAN) specification [38].\nNot used for ProSe Direct Discovery\nService Info Length\nAn optional field and present if service specific information is used\nSet to the length of the PC5_DISCOVERY message.\nService Info\nAn optional field that contains the service specific information. Its content may be determined by the application and not specified herein.\nPC5_DISCOVERY message.\nNOTE:\tThe definition of the text string for 3GPP-defined Service Category for ProSe is defined in Stage 3 specifications.\nThe ProSe Protocol layer in the UE participating in the discovery process using the Wi-Fi NAN technology subscribes to the Service ID for the 3GPP-defined Service Category for ProSe.\nThe NAN Discovery Engine accepts all the Service Discovery Frames received over the air with a matching Service ID, extracts the PC5_DISCOVERY messages and generates a \"DiscoveryResult\" event that conveys the PC5_DISCOVERY messages to the ProSe Protocol layer for further processing.\nAnnex D (Informative):Change history\nChange
