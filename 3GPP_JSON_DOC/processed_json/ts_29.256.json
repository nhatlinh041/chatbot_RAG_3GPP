respect to the encoding of information elements and methods within the API(s).\nNOTE 1:\tThe semantics and procedures, as well as conditions, e.g. for the applicability and allowed combinations of attributes or values, not expressed in the OpenAPI definitions but defined in other parts of the specification also apply.\nInformative copies of the OpenAPI specification files contained in this 3GPP
