For example, upon receiving a Termination Request from one of the NWDAFs that are collectively serving a request for analytics subscription, the Aggregator NWDAF queries the NRF or UDM to select a target NWDAF using information e.g. the UE location, the 5GC NFs (identified by their NF Set IDs or NF types) serving the UE or to be contacted for data collection (if Area of Interest is not provisioned for the requested analytics), or the subset of AoI (if Area of Interest is provisioned for the requested analytics).

In such a case, the source NWDAF may send a message to indicate to the NWDAF service consumer that it will not serve this subscription anymore.\nNOTE 1:\tTo discover the possible change of NWDAF service consumer, if the Analytics Event is UE related, the source NWDAF takes actions responding to external trigger (such as UE mobility), for example, checking if the Target of Analytics Reporting is still within the serving area of the analytics consumer, if the serving area information is available.\nNOTE 2:\tHandling of overload situation or preparation for a graceful shutdown are preferably executed inside an NWDAF Set, when available, therefore, not requiring an analytics subscription transfer as described in this clause.

Therefore, the source NWDAF determines the analytics subscription(s) to be transferred to a target NWDAF.\n3.\tSource NWDAF performs an NWDAF discovery and selects the target NWDAF. NWDAF discovery may be skipped if the target NWDAF had already been discovered as part of a prepared analytics subscription transfer.

A new Subscription ID, which was assigned by the target NWDAF, is provided in the Subscription ID and the old Subscription Id, which was allocated by the source NWDAF, is provided in the Old Subscription ID parameter of this message.\nNOTE 6:\tNotification correlation information in the Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription_Notify message allows the NWDAF service consumer to correlate the notifications to the initial subscription request made with the source NWDAF in step 0.\nNOTE 7:\tThe existing Analytics context in the source NWDAF is not deleted directly but will be purged first when it was collected by the target NWDAF.\nNOTE 8:\tIf this subscription is used as input for analytics aggregation by the NWDAF service consumer, the NWDAF service consumer may inform the other NWDAFs instance participating in this analytics aggregation that the Set of NWDAF identifiers of NWDAF instances used by the NWDAF service consumer for this analytics aggregation has changed using the Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription_Subscribe service operation as described in clause 4.2.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.520 [5].\n7.\t[Conditional] If \"analytics context identifier(s)\" had been included in the Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription_Transfer Request received in step 4, the target NWDAF requests the \"analytics context\" by invoking the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_ContextTransfer service operation as described in clause 4.3.2.3 of 3GPP TS 29.520 [5].\n8.\t[Optional] Target NWDAF subscribes to relevant data source(s), if it is not yet subscribed to the data source(s) for the data required for the Analytics.\n9.\t[Optional] Target NWDAF confirms the analytics subscription transfer to the source NWDAF by sending Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription_Transfer response message as described in clause 4.2.2.5 of 3GPP TS 29.520 [5], if the response has not been sent in step 4b.\n10.\t[Optional] Source NWDAF unsubscribes with the data source(s) that are no longer needed for the remaining analytics subscriptions.

      "content": "This procedure depicted in Figure 5.5.3.2-1 is used by a data consumer (e.g. NWDAF) to obtain data and be notified of events using the DCCF and a Messaging Framework. The 3GPP DCCF Adaptor (3da) Data Management service and 3GPP Consumer Adaptor (3ca) Data Management service of the Messaging Framework Adaptor Function (MFAF) are used to interact with the Messaging Framework. Whether the data consumer directly contacts the Data Source or goes via the DCCF is based on configuration.\nFigure 5.5.3.2-1: Data Collection via DCCF and via Messaging Framework\n1.\tIn order to subscribe to notification(s) of events exposure via the DCCF based on local configuration, the Data Consumer invokes the Ndccf_DataManagement_Subscribe service operation by sending an HTTP POST request message targeting the resource \"DCCF Data Subscriptions\", as described in clause 4.2.2.2.4 of 3GPP TS 29.574 [15].\n2a.\tIf data is to be collected for a user, the user consent has not been checked by the data consumer, if the local policy and regulations require to check user consent, the DCCF shall invoke the Nudm_SDM_Get service operation by sending an HTTP GET request as described in clause 5.2.2.2.24 and clause 6.1.3.32 of 3GPP TS 29.503 [22]. Otherwise the procedure continues with step 4.\n3a.\tThe UDM responds to the Nudm_SDM_Get service operation. If the request is accepted, the response includes the requested data with \"200 OK\" status code. In subsequent steps, the DCCF excludes the SUPI or GPSI from requests to collect data for users for whom the user consent is not granted.\n2b.\tFor the users for which the user consent is granted, the DCCF subscribes to notifications of changes of the user consent by invoking the Nudm_SDM_Subscribe service operation by sending an HTTP POST request message targeting the resource \"SdmSubscriptions\" at the UDM as described in clause 5.2.2.3 of 3GPP TS 29.503 [22].\n3b.\tThe UDM responds to the Nudm_SDM_Subscribe service operation. If the request is accepted, the UDM responds with \"201 Created\" status code.\n4.\tIf the DCCF is configured to perform data delivery via the MFAF, in order to create configuration of mapping data in the MFAF, the DCCF shall invoke the Nmfaf_3daDataManagement_Configure service operation by sending an HTTP POST request message targeting the resource \"MFAF Configurations\", as described in clause 4.2.2.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.576 [17].\nIn order to update configuration of mapping data in the MFAF, the DCCF shall invoke the Nmfaf_3daDataManagement_Configure service operation by sending an HTTP PUT request message targeting the resource \"Individual MFAF Configuration\", as described in clause 4.2.2.2.3 of 3GPP TS 29.576 [17].\n5.\tThe MFAF responds to the Nmfaf_3daDataManagement_Configure service operation.\nUpon receipt of the HTTP POST request message, if the configuration is accepted to be created, the MFAF responds to the DCCF with \"201 Created\" status code, and the URI of the created configuration is included in the Location header field.\nUpon receipt of the HTTP PUT request message, if the configuration is accepted to be updated, the MFAF responds to the DCCF with \"200 OK\" or \"204 No Content\" status code.\n6.\tThe DCCF determines the NF type(s) and/or OAM to retrieve the data based on the Service Operation requested in step 1. If the NF instance or NF Set ID is not provided by the data consumer. the DCCF determines the NF instances that can provide data as described in TS 23.288 [2] clause 5A.2 and clause 6.2.2.2. If the consumer requested storage of data in an ADRF but the ADRF ID is not provided by the data consumer, or the collected data is to be stored in an ADRF according to configuration on the DCCF, the DCCF selects an ADRF to store the collected data.\nThe DCCF keeps track of the data actively being collected from the Data Sources it is coordinating. The NWDAF or ADRF may register the data collection profile (including the data collection related Service Operation, Analytics/Data Specification, NWDAF ID or ADRF ID) with the DCCF. The DCCF may then determine whether certain historical data may be available in the NWDAF or ADRF based on the data collection profile and the request time window.\nIf the historical data handling is not applicable or not supported, the DCCF shall proceed with step 7a, and skip step 7b, step 8b, step 9b, step 7c, step 8c, and step 9c.\nIf the historical data is available in an ADRF, the DCCF shall proceed with step 7a and step 7b, and skip step 7c, step 8c, and step 9c.\nIf the historical data is available in an NWDAF, the DCCF shall proceed with step 7a and step 7c, and skip step 7b, step 8b, and step 9b.\n7a.\tThe DCCF shall determine whether the data requested in step 1 are already being collected by an existing subscription or can be collected by modifying an existing subscription.\n8a.\tIf data requested in step 1 can be collected neither by an existing subscription nor by modifying an existing subscriptionare, the DCCF shall invoke the Nnf_EventExposure_Subscribe service operation by sending an HTTP POST request message request to the NF targeting the resource representing event exposure subscriptions to subscribe to a new event exposure subscription, e.g. as described in clause 5.5.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.503 [22] for the UDM, clause 5.3.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.518 [18] for the AMF, clause 4.2.3 of 3GPP TS 29.508 [6] for the SMF, clause 4.2.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.591 [11] for the NEF, or clause 4.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.517 [12] for the AF.\nOtherwise, the DCCF shall send a request to the individual event exposure subscription resource to update an existing event exposure subscription, e.g. as described in clause 5.5.2.5 of 3GPP TS 29.503 [22] for the UDM, clause 5.3.2.2.3 of 3GPP TS 29.518 [18] for the AMF, clause 4.2.3.3 of 3GPP TS 29.508 [6] for the SMF,

update is performed simply to authorize the new source NF as described in clause 6.7.5.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [13].\nOtherwise, if the requested data subscribed in step 1 partially matches data that is already being collected by the DCCF from an NF, and a modification of this subscription to the NF would satisfy both the existing data  subscriptions as well as the newly requested data, the DCCF shall send a request to the individual event exposure subscription resource to update an existing event exposure subscription, e.g. as described in clause 5.5.2.5 of 3GPP TS 29.503 [22] for the UDM, clause 5.3.2.2.3 of 3GPP TS 29.518 [18] for the AMF, clause 4.2.3.3 of 3GPP TS 29.508 [6] for the SMF, clause 4.2.2.2.3 of 3GPP TS 29.591 [11] for the NEF, or clause 4.2.2.3 of 3GPP TS 29.517 [12] for the AF.\n9a.\tThe NF responds to the Nnf_EventExposure_Subscribe service operation.\nUpon receipt of the HTTP POST request message, if the subscription is accepted to be created, the NF responds to

The FL Server NWDAF makes this decision, considering the notification from the FL Client NWDAF or, if the notification is not received, based on local configuration.\n6a.\t[Optional] Based on the NWDAF service consumer request, the FL Server NWDAF updates the global ML model metric to the NWDAF service consumer periodically or dynamically when some pre-determined status (e.g. ML model accuracy threshold) is achieved.\n6aa-6ab.\tTo report the ML model training information, the FL Server NWDAF invokes Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Notify service operation as defined in clause 4.5.2.4 of 3GPP TS 29.520 [5].

If it terminates the current FL training process, steps 7 and 8 are skipped.\n7.\tIf the FL procedure continues, the FL Server NWDAF sends the aggregated ML model information to each FL Client NWDAF for next round model training.\nTo modify the existing subscription, the FL Server NWDAF invokes Nnwdaf_MLModelTraining_Subscribe service operation by sending an HTTP PUT request or an HTTP PATCH request with Resource URI of the resource \"Individual NWDAF ML Model Training Subscription\". The FL Client NWDAF responds to the FL Server NWDAF an HTTP \"200 OK\" or \"204 No Content\" status code, as defined in clauses 4.6.2.2.3 and 4.6.2.2.4 of 3GPP TS 29.520 [5].\n8.\tEach FL Client NWDAF updates its own ML model based on the aggregated ML model information distributed by the FL Server NWDAF at step 7.\nNOTE 2:\tThe steps 4-8 should be repeated until the training termination condition (e.g. maximum number of iterations, or the result of loss function is lower than a threshold) is reached.\n9a-9b.\tTo unsubscribe to the notifications of data events from the data source NF, the FL Client NWDAF invokes the Nnf_EventExposure_Unsubscribe service operation by sending an HTTP DELETE request targeting the resource that represents the previously created individual event exposure subscription.\nThe data source NF responds to the Nnf_EventExposure_Unsubscribe service operation. If the subscription deletion is accepted, the NF responds with \"204 No Content\".\n10.\tIf the FL Server NWDAF determines that the subscribed ML model information is available, the FL Server NWDAF may invoke the Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Notify service operation or the Nnwdaf_MLModelTraining_Notify service operation to report the ML model information by sending an HTTP POST request to the NWDAF service consumer identified by the notification URI received during the creation/modification of the subscriptions.

      "content": "This procedure is used by the NWDAF containing MTLF (the FL Server NWDAF) to maintain a FL process in FL execution phase, including: the FL Server NWDAF triggers reselection, addition, or removal of FL Client NWDAF(s), discovery of new FL Client NWDAF(s) via NRF, and FL Client NWDAF(s) joins or leaves FL process dynamically.\nIn FL execution phase, the FL Server NWDAF monitors the status changes of FL Client NWDAF(s), and may reselect the FL Client NWDAF(s) based on the received information of status changes.\nNOTE:\tThe FL Server NWDAF checks if there is a need to carry on the FL execution phase and then reselects FL members for the next iteration if needed.\nFigure 5.10.2.3-1: Procedure for Maintenance of Federated Learning Process in FL Execution Phase\nThe FL Server NWDAF registered to NRF by invoking the Nnrf_NFManagement_NFRegister_request service operation about the FL process, which includes Analytics ID.\n1.\tThe FL Server NWDAF may get the updated status of the current FL Client NWDAF(s) via NRF by using the Nnrf_NFManagement service in the FL execution phase. Details are described in clauses 5.2.2.5 and 5.2.2.6 of 3GPP TS 29.510 [26].\n2.\tThe current FL Client NWDAF(s) may inform the FL Server NWDAF to leave the FL process. The FL Client NWDAF(s) invokes Nnwdaf_MLModelTraining_Notify service operation by sending an HTTP POST request to the FL Server NWDAF identified by the notification URI received during the creation/modification of the subscriptions. Details are described in clause 4.6.2.4 of 3GPP TS 29.520 [5]. The FL Server NWDAF responds to the Nnwdaf_MLModelTraining_Notify service operation with an HTTP \"204 No Content\" status code to the FL Client NWDAF(s).\n3.\tThe FL Server NWDAF may get the information of the new FL Client NWDAF(s) dynamically via NRF. Details are described in clauses 5.2.2.5 and 5.2.2.6 of 3GPP TS 29.510 [26].\n4.\tThe FL Server NWDAF may subscribe to other NWDAF (Assist NWDAF) or the FL Client NWDAF(s) for analytics of the FL Client NWDAF(s), as defined in clauses 4.2.2.2 and 4.2.2.4 of 3GPP TS 29.520 [5].\n5.\tThe FL Client NWDAF(s) may send Status report of FL training and Global ML Model Accuracy Information. The FL Client NWDAF(s) invokes Nnwdaf_MLModelTraining_Notify service operation to the FL Server NWDAF. The FL Server NWDAF stores the notification and responds to the Nnwdaf_MLModelTraining_Notify service operation with an HTTP \"204 No Content\" status code to the FL Client NWDAF(s). Details are described in clause 4.6.2.4 of 3GPP TS 29.520 [5].\n6.\tThe FL Server NWDAF checks the FL Client NWDAF(s) status based on the received information, determines whether reselection of the FL Client NWDAF(s) for the next round(s) of FL is needed. The checking and determination are made according to the updated status of the FL Client NWDAF(s) received in steps 1-5.\n7.\tIf re-selection is needed as determined in step 6 and if step 3 is not performed, the FL Server NWDAF may discover new candidate FL Client NWDAF(s) via NRF by using the Nnrf_NFDiscovery services as described in clause 5.3.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.510 [26]. The FL Server NWDAF reselects the FL Client NWDAF(s) from the current FL Client NWDAF(s) and the new candidate FL Client NWDAF(s).\n8.\tThe FL Server NWDAF sends termination request to the FL Client NWDAF(s) which will be removed from the FL process, and optionally indicating the reason. The FL Client NWDAF(s) terminates FL operations when receives a termination request from the FL Server NWDAF and may perform further action to be qualified in participation of FL training in the next cycles.\n8a-8b.\tTo send the termination request, the FL Server NWDAF may invoke the Nnwdaf_MLModelTraining_Unsubscribe service operation by sending an HTTP DELETE request, which targets the resource \"Individual NWDAF ML Model Training Subscription\", to the FL Client NWDAF(s). If the request is accepted, the FL Client NWDAF deletes the subscription and responds to the FL Server NWDAF service consumer with an HTTP \"204 No Content\" message. Details are described in clause 4.6.2.3 of 3GPP TS 29.520 [5].",
