The purpose of the Annex is to ensure the interoperability of different implementations of M3UAs used by different operators and vendors. This is achieved by:\n-\tClarifying certain concepts which are used in RFC 4666;\n-\tDefining those features in RFC 4666 for which support is mandatory;\n-\tDefining those features in the RFC 4666 for which support is optional;\n-\tDefining those features in RFC 4666 which shall not be used;\nThe specification is intended for interfaces between network domains, however, it can also be used inside one network domain, and constitutes a minimum set of M3UA requirements to be supported between IP nodes and between IP nodes and SGW nodes in a 3GPP network.\nA.2\tIntroduction\nM3UA may be used on a number of interfaces in a 3GPP core network. The annex is intended for the interface called A and C in figure 1. A is the Interface between two IP nodes that are equipped with SCTP, M3UA and a M3UA user. Examples of M3UA user are BICC, H.248, SCCP and  ISUP. The interface can be used inside one network domain but also to interconnect network domains. Interface B can be used between network domains and inside network domains. Interface B is not in the scope for this annex, however, use of Q.701-Q.705 or Q.2210 on interface B is already standardised; in addition, M2PA is also endorsed for interface B in accordance with Annex B. Interface C is the interface between a node including SCTP, M3UA and a M3UA user and a node including SCTP, M3UA and M3UAsignalling gateway functions.. This interface is inside one network domain.\nInterfaces A and C are similar. The main difference is that interface C shall also allow for interworking with the SS 7 network and therefore provides functions for the interworking.\nThe signalling gateways in this picture are pure MTP3/3B-M3UA signaling gateways. They do not include any M3UA users. Still there could be a node including an M3UA user (e.g. SCCP functions) and a M3UA signalling gateway functions. In that case, the node will support all the interfaces A, B and C.\nFigure 1: Use of M3UA in 3GPP core network\nA.3\tProtocol conformance to RFC 4666\nA minimum implementation shall support sections marked mandatory in the table below.  It shall be possible to configure all implementations to interoperate (no error messages returned) with the minimum set.\nThe table below makes comment to the sections in RFC 4666. In the comment column the following terms are used:\n-\tMandatory: When support of text in a section is marked mandatory:\n-\tOn an information element, message or message class, it means that a receiver shall understand the information element, message or message class and carry out the requested action.\n-\tFor a procedure, it means that the procedure is mandatory to be carried out by the involved network elements.\n-\tOptional: When support of the text in a section is marked optional the feature involved is only guaranteed to work between peer entities which are subject to a bilateral agreement between operators of those entities. If one end uses an optional message or information element and the other does not support it, then either a silent discard takes place of an information element as a part of the message  or the message is discarded and an error message is returned. This is described as part of the handling of the optionality in the table.\n-\tExcluded: This means that the feature shall not be used in a 3GPP environment\nDescriptive text means that the section does not include any requirements for this specification.\nNote: The word \"heading\" means that the section consists only of subordinate sections.\nThe comments column also defines the behaviour of a minimum implementation if it does not support a message or an information element in a mandatory message.\nSection number in M3UA RFC\nComments\nAbstract\nDescriptive text\n1.Introduction\nDescriptive text\n1.1 Scope\nDescriptive text\n1.2 Terminology\nDescriptive text.\n1.3 M3UA overview\nDescriptive text.\n1.4 Functional area\nDescriptive text.\n1.5 Sample Configurations\nDescriptive text\n1.6 Definition of M3UA Boundaries\nDescriptive text\n2 Conventions\nDescriptive text\n3.

The purpose of the Annex is to ensure the interoperability of different implementations of M2PA as used by different operators and vendors. This is achieved by:\n-\tClarifying certain concepts which are used in RFC 4165;\n-\tDefining those features in RFC 4165 for which support is mandatory;\n-\tDefining those features in the RFC 4165 for which support is optional;\n-\tDefining those features in RFC 4165 which shall not be used;\nThis specification is intended for interfaces between network domains. However, it can also be used inside one network domain, and constitutes, in that case, a minimum set of M2PA requirements to be supported between IP nodes and between SRP nodes in a 3GPP network.\nB.2\tIntroduction\nM2PA may be used between SRPs, i.e. interface B (refer to Figure 1 of Annex A).\nFigure 2 recommends how M2PA is used in a 3GPP IP based signalling network.\nFigure B2.1: Use of M2PA in 3GPP core networks\nB.3\tProtocol conformance to RFC 4165\nA minimum implementation shall support sections marked mandatory in the table below.  It shall be possible to configure all implementations to interoperate (no error messages returned) with the minimum set.\nThe table below makes comment to the sections in RFC 4165. In the comment column the following terms are used:\n-\tMandatory: When support of text in a section is marked mandatory:\n-\tOn an information element, message or message class, it means that a receiver shall understand the information element, message or message class and carry out the requested action.\n-\tFor a procedure, it means that the procedure is mandatory to be carried out by the involved network elements.\n-\tOptional: When support of the text in a section is marked optional the feature involved is only guaranteed to work between peer entities which are subject to a bilateral agreement between operators of those entities. If one end uses an optional information element and the other does not support it, then a silent discard takes place of an information element as a part of the message. This is described as part of the handling of the optionality in the table.\n-\tExcluded: This means that the feature shall not be used in a 3GPP environment\nDescriptive text means that the section does not include any requirements for this specification.\nNote: The word \"heading\" means that the section consists only of subordinate sections.\nThe comments column also defines the behaviour of a minimum implementation if it does not support a message or an information element in a mandatory message.\nSection number in M2PA RFC\nComments\nAbstract\nDescriptive text\n1.Introduction\nDescriptive text\n1.1 Scope\nDescriptive text\n1.2 Terminology\nDescriptive text.\n1.3 Abbreviations\nDescriptive text.\n1.4 Conventions\nDescriptive text.\n1.5.
