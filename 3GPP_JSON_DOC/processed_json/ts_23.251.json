There are two identified architectures to be supported by network sharing. They are shown in the figures below.\nIn both architectures, the radio access network is shared. Figure 1 below shows reference architecture for network sharing in which also MSCs and SGSNs are shared. This configuration will be referred to as a Gateway Core Network (GWCN) configuration.\nFigure 1: A Gateway Core Network (GWCN) configuration for network sharing. Besides shared radio access network nodes, the core network operators also share core network nodes\nFigure 2 below shows the reference architecture for network sharing in which only the radio access network is shared, the Multi-Operator Core Network (MOCN) configuration.\nFigure 2: A Multi-Operator Core Network (MOCN) in which multiple CN nodes are connected to the same RNC and the CN nodes are operated by different operators\nThe UE behaviour in both of these configurations shall be the same. No information concerning the configuration of a shared network shall be indicated to the UE.\nFor the Evolved Packet System, only the PS domain of the above figures is relevant. For E‑UTRAN access Figures 1 and 2 both apply but with the MME replacing the SGSN, the eNodeB replacing the RNC, and the S1 reference point replacing the Iu interface.\nFor GERAN access, both GWCN and MOCN are applicable but with the BSC replacing the RNC and the A/Gb-Interfaces replacing the Iu interface.",

For non-supporting UEs, the shared network selects an operator from the available CN operators. For supporting UEs, the selection of core network operator by the UE shall be respected by the network. Supporting UEs inform the BSC/RNC/eNodeB of the network identity of the chosen core network operator.\nIn a UTRAN GWCN configuration, the RNC relays the chosen network identity to the shared core network node (in UTRAN MOCN, the RNC indicates that the UE is a \"supporting UE\" by relaying the chosen network identity to the core network node). To permit GWCN operation, in E‑UTRAN, the eNodeB always relays the chosen network identity to the shared MME. In a GERAN GWCN configuration, the BSC relays the chosen network identity to the core network node (in GERAN MOCN, the BSC indicates that the UE is a \"supporting UE\" by relaying the chosen network identity to the core network node).\nIn a MOCN configuration, the RAN routes the UE's initial access to the shared network to one of the available CN nodes. Supporting UEs shall inform the RAN of the chosen core network operator so that the RAN can route correctly. For non-supporting UEs the shared network selects an operator from the available CN operators. A redirection to another CN operator may be required for non-supporting UEs until an operator is found that can serve the UE. Redirection is described in clause 7.1.4.\nAfter initial access to the shared network the UE does not change to another available CN operator as long as the selected CN operator is available to serve the UE's location. Only the network selection procedures specified in TS 23.122 [4] may cause a reselection of another available CN operator. Also the network does not move the UE to another available CN operator, e.g. by handover, as long as the selected CN operator is available to serve the UE's location. Furthermore the UE does not change to another CN node as long as the selected CN node is available to serve the UE's location.\nIn GERAN and UTRAN, when the network signals location/routing area identities to supporting UEs, e.g. in location updating accept messages, these identities shall contain the chosen core network operator identity. For non-supporting UEs, they shall contain the common PLMN. The UE stores the received LAI/RAI on the SIM/USIM, as already specified in TS 24.008 [7].\nIn E‑UTRAN, the chosen core network operator identity is included in the GUTI in e.g. the Attach Accept message.

In a shared network, supporting UEs shall behave as UEs in conventional networks with respect to registration with CS and PS domains and always register with the same operator for the CS and PS domains. CS/PS coordination should be performed at registration when a redirect attempt flag is included in A/Gb/Iu messages carrying the NAS registration message (see TS 48.008 [25], TS 48.018 [24], and TS 25.413 [13]). The term registration includes attach, and LA and RA updates.\nWhen multiple PLMNs are available and SRVCC from UTRAN/GERAN CS domain to E-UTRAN/HSPA PS is deployed, the source BSC/RNC determines a core network operator to be used in the target network based on current PLMN in use, Anchor PLMN provided by PS core network, or other information present in the BSC/RNC. The source BSC/RNC shall at handover indicate the selected core network operator to the source core network node in the handover required message. The anchor MSC Server shall forward the selected core network operator chosen by the source BSC/RNC to the target MME/SGSN.\n4.2.5a\tPS and CS domain registration coordination in E-UTRAN\nWhen multiple core network operators share the E‑UTRAN using a GWCN configuration, separate MSCs may still be used for the CS Fall Back functionality. In this case the MME uses the 'selected network' information received from the E‑UTRAN to select an MSC from the already selected operator.\nWhen multiple PLMNs are available for CS domain, the MME selects the MSC for CS Fallback functionality based on the 'selected network' information received from the E‑UTRAN, current TAI, old LAI provided by the UE and operator selection policies as specified in TS 23.272 [15]. In this case, the selected PLMN-id for CS domain may be different to the PLMN-id for EPS domain. If the selected MSC is shared network configured, the MME selects the CS domain operator as specified in TS 23.272 [15]. If the UE is a GERAN network-sharing non-supporting UE and the preferred RAT of the selected CS network is GERAN with GWCN configuration, or the preferred RAT of the selected CS network is shared network in GWCN configuration not offering the broadcast of available Core Network operators for selection by the UE, the MME sends the 'selected CS domain operator' in addition to the Common PLMN-id included in the LAI to the VLR. If the MSC is GWCN configured, the MSC applies local policy (e.g. uses a fixed split of IMSI ranges or IMSI hash) to determines the CN operator when the PLMN-id included in the LAI contains Common PLMN-id (i.e. does not identify any CS domain operator) and the 'selected CS domain operator' is absent. Otherwise, the MSC accepts the CS domain operator selected by the MME.\nWhen multiple PLMNs are available for CS domain and SRVCC from E-UTRAN PS to UTRAN/GERAN CS domain is deployed, the MME sends the Handover Restriction List (see TS 23.401 [9]) to eNB including the currently serving PLMN and equivalent PLMNs together with information about which PLMNs are preferred for SRVCC. The eNB selects target PLMN for SRVCC from the list based on HRL and local policy and constructs the Neighbour Cell list (NCL) based on this knowledge of the target PLMN. The selected target core network PLMN should, if possible, be the same as the one in use.",

In all Attach Request/Routeing Area Update Request/Location Area Update Request messages from the BSC/RNC to CN a redirect attempt flag shall be included to indicate that the CN should either return a Reroute Command or a Reroute Complete message. If the BSC/RNC can determine that the UE is already served by a CN operator in the opposite domain, then a CN node from this operator shall be selected and the serving CN operator shall be indicated to the CN node together with an indication that the selected CN operator is already serving the UE in the opposite domain. If the BSC/RNC cannot determine a CN operator this way, the selection of CN node by the BSC/RNC is based on the NRI if provided by the UE. The RAN stores the NRI received from the UE.\nIf the UE is already served by the CN node that receives the registration request and this CN node can continue to serve the UE (for example if there are no regional roaming restrictions for the target area), or if the UE is a non-roaming subscriber, or if the BSC/RNC indicated a BSC/RNC selected CN operator and that the selected CN operator is serving the UE in the opposite domain then the CN node accepts the registration attempt and completes the registration procedure. Otherwise the CN node returns IMSI and a Reroute Command message to the BSC/RNC with an indication that it is for coordination purposes. The old LAI (for the CS domain) or old RAI (for the PS domain), or an indication whether the UE is attaching shall also be included.\nBased on information received from CN node (old LAI or old RAI), UE (CS-NRI or PS-NRI, as stored in the RAN) and BSC/RNC internal configuration the BSC/RNC concludes whether:\n(i)\tThe UE is 'under operator coordination' i.e. if the UEs (CS-NRI, old LAI) tuple for the CS domain or (PS-NRI, old RAI) tuple for the PS domain can be used to uniquely identify one of the operators in the shared network.

The old RAI/PS-NRI can be \"native\" (i.e. no RAT change) or \"mapped\" (i.e. RAT change).\n(iii)\tThe UE is attaching.\nFor case (i) the BSC/RNC selects serving CN operator based on the identified operator and routes the request to the selected operator. The IMSI and the BSC/RNC selected CN operator shall be indicated to the CN.\nFor case (ii) and (iii) the BSC/RNC shall for a (combined or non-combined) registration attempt in the PS domain query its connected MSCs, whether the UE is registered with any of the sharing operators in the CS domain. Similarly for a registration attempt in the CS domain the BSC/RNC shall query its connected SGSNs, whether the UE is registered at any of the sharing operators in the PS domain. For a registration attempt in the CS domain this means that the SGSNs on behalf of the BSC/RNC may be needed to query all MMEs that may hold the UEs context of the sharing operators whether the UE is registered at any of the MMEs of the sharing operators. Registration in MME but not in the CS domain can e.g. occur at cell reselection from LTE for a UE that is not SGs registered. If MMEs are not updated to support registration queries, it may not be possible to guarantee CS/PS coordination in certain scenarios.\nFor case (ii) and (iii) and if the UE is found to be registered with one of the sharing operators then that operator shall be selected by the BSC/RNC and the registration message shall be forwarded to a CN node of this operator. The BSC/RNC selected CN operator shall be indicated to the CN and the BSC/RNC shall indicate that BSC/RNC selected CN operator is serving the UE in the opposite domain.\nFor cases (ii) and (iii) and the UE is not found to be registered at one of the sharing operators then the BSC/RNC routes the request to one of the available CN operators. Selection of CN operator is done in the BSC/RNC by IMSI analysis, e.g. using a fixed split of IMSI ranges or IMSI hash table between operators, etc. The CN node / CN operator selection may result in that the registration is sent back to the same CN node or CN operator again. At non-combined registration CS/PS coordination is done in the BSC/RNC (without memorising IMSI information for IDLE mode UEs) by applying the same IMSI analysis for both CS and PS domains. The BSC/RNC selected CN operator shall be indicated to the CN and IMSI shall be included to the CN node.\nIf a registration attempt is ongoing in the PS domain when a registration attempt starts in the CS domain then the BSC/RNC selects operator as specified below and the IMSI and the BSC/RNC selected CN operator shall be sent to the CN node:\n-\tIf for the CS domain case (i) applies then that operator shall be selected for both domains.\n-\tIf for the CS domain case (ii) or (iii) applies then depending on:\n-\tIf for the PS domain case (i) applies then that operator shall be selected for both domains\n-\tIf for the PS domain case (ii) or (iii) applies then the BCS/RNC selects operator for both domains based on IMSI analysis\nSimilar handling applies if a registration attempt is ongoing in the CS domain when a registration attempt starts in the PS domain.\nAt combined registration the SGSN may indicate over Gs interface the selected CN operator that serves the subscriber.\nNOTE:\tSupport for CS/PS domain coordination functionality as specified in this release requires support in shared CN nodes (for GWCN) and non-shared CN nodes (for MOCN) as well as in the shared RAN to achieve CS/PS coordination for UEs in the shared network. If sufficient support is not available, CS/PS coordination is performed as in pre- Release 13.",

The equivalent PLMN list should be configured such that for any target cell there is only one PLMN-ID that can be selected for the cell.\nAlso, for the above scenario, in the routing areas and tracking areas between which ISR may be activated the \"equivalent PLMNs\" list provided by the SGSN, MSC and MME to a UE (see TS 24.008 [7]) should result in a single consistent \"equivalent PLMNs\" list stored by the UE. The single \"equivalent PLMNs\" list applies to all the UE's registered routing areas, location areas and tracking areas.\nFor sharing scenarios with both E-UTRAN and GERAN/UTRAN access, when multiple PLMNs are available for CS domain to support CS Fallback functionality, the MME provides the allocated LAI including the selected PLMN ID for CS domain along with \"CS Fallback indicator\" to the eNodeB as specified in TS 23.272 [15], to guide the selection of the target GERAN/UTRAN network.\nIf the operator-configured preferred target RAT for CS Fallback is a shared RAN not offering the broadcast of available Core Network operators for selection by the UE, the MME shall always select the common PLMN broadcasted in the shared RAN as the selected PLMN-id for the CS domain.\nIf the operator-configured preferred target RAT for CS Fallback is a shared RAN offering the broadcast of available Core Network operators for selection by the UE, the MME shall take into account the UE's capability of supporting network sharing in the preferred target RAT when selecting the PLMN for the CS domain for CS Fallback. For GERAN network sharing, the UE signals its capability of GERAN network sharing support explicitly to the MME. If the UE is a network-sharing non-supporting UE with respect to the preferred target RAT, a common PLMN-id shall be selected, while if the UE is a network-sharing supporting UE with respect to the preferred target RAT, one of the PLMN-IDs in the broadcasted multiple PLMN-id list of the preferred target shared RAT shall be selected as the PLMN-id for the CS domain.\nThe selected PLMN-id for the CS domain shall be included the allocated LAI sent to the MSC/VLR as defined in TS 23.272 [15].\nIf the shared network is in GWCN configuration, MME sends the 'selected CS domain operator' as indicated in clause 4.2.5a.\nThe list of PLMN-ID(s) included in the handover restriction list (as defined in TS 36.413 [14]), if provided by the MME to the eNB for the target PLMN selection, shall be configured such that for any target GERAN/UTRAN cell, only PLMN-ID(s) associated with the same CN operator as the one that the UE has registered to in the CS domain can be selected by the eNB when one of the following conditions apply:\n-\tthe preferred RAT of the registered network is shared network not offering the broadcast of available Core Network operators for selection by the UE, or,\n-\tthe RAT preference for the UE is GERAN and the allocated LAI belongs to a shared GERAN and the UE is a GERAN network-sharing non-supporting UE.\nThe list of PLMN-ID(s) included in the equivalent PLMN list sent to the UE shall be configured to include the list of PLMN IDs in the handover restriction list.\nNOTE:\tWhen performing CS Fallback to GERAN/UTRAN cell, if the PLMN-ID(s) in the equivalent PLMN list contains a CS CN operator(s) PLMN different from the registered CS PLMN, then the UE may possibly select a CS CN operator it has not registered to.\nAt handover/relocation to a GWCN or a MOCN:\n-\tThe source MME uses the TAI/RAI information supplied by the eNodeB to select the target MME/SGSN. There is no additional functionality in the source MME to select a target core network operator or to modify the target core network operator selected by the eNodeB. Instead, the source MME uses the selected PLMN received from the eNodeB to determine the target core network operator. The source MME shall forward the selected target core network operator chosen by the source eNodeB to the target MME/SGSN.\n-\tThe target MME indicates the selected target core network operator chosen by the source eNodeB/RNC/BSC to the target eNodeB so that the eNodeB can select target cells for future handovers appropriately. Subsequent Tracking Area Update signalling is used to update the UE about any change of core network operator.\n-\tAt SRVCC from E-UTRAN PS to UTRAN/GERAN CS domain, the MME selects the MSC based on the selected target PLMN indicated by the eNodeB. The MME includes the indication of the selected target PLMN in the target CGI/RNC ID and Anchor PLMN in the PS-to-CS Request sent to the MSC (see TS 29.280 [21]).\nIn signalling to the S-GW/P-GW and HSS, the MME shall ensure that any PLMN ID that is sent is the ID of the selected Core Network Operator.\nThe behaviour of the MME in relation to CS/PS coordination in GERAN and UTRAN for non-supporting UEs is described in clause 4.2.5.3.",

Selection of CN node is based on NRI (valid or invalid) if present in IDNNS or by random selection.\nA redirect attempt flag could also simply be the fact that the Initial UE message does not include any UE selected PLMN-ID, which a supporting UE would include.

The UE will repeat its attach request four times (each time waiting 15 seconds before it re-establishes the RR connection for another try).",

NRI is part of the temporary identity TMSI (CS domain) or P-TMSI (PS domain), which is assigned by the serving CN node to the MS. This clause describes NRI usage in MOCN.\nWithin the shared network NRIs has to be coordinated between the operators at least due to following reasons:\n-\tto avoid redirection or CS/PS un-coordination when the non-supporting UE performs LA/RA update.\n-\tto achieve that correct UE answers to paging (TMSI/P-TMSI shall be unique within shared network).\n-\tto achieve that a non-supporting UE in visited PLMN will not change network due to LA/RA update or Detach/Attach function.\n-\tto achieve that non-supporting UE in visited PLMN remains CS/PS coordinated when the UE moves within shared network.\nOperator coordination of CS-NRI and LAI tuple for the CS domain, and PS-NRI and RAI tuple for the PS domain is also required between the shared network and the dedicated networks of the sharing partners:\n-\tto achieve that non-supporting UE in visited PLMN remain registered in the same operators network when the UE moves from dedicated network to a shared network.\n-\tto achieve that non-supporting UE in visited PLMN remains CS/PS coordinated when the UE moves from dedicated network to a shared network.\nBy coordinating the actual values of the CS-NRIs for the CS domain and the PS-NRIs/MMECs for the PS domains between networks, additional signalling can be avoided when handling LA/RA updates for subscribers of the sharing partners since analysis of LAI/RAI will not be necessary.\nOperator coordination of TAI and MMEC (mapped to PS-NRI) is also required between shared UTRAN or GERAN and E-UTRANs of the sharing partners:\n-\tto achieve that non-supporting UE in visited PLMN remain registered in the same operators network when the UE moves from dedicated network to a shared network.\n-\tto achieve that non-supporting UE in visited PLMN becomes CS/PS coordinated when the UE moves from EUTRAN to a shared UTRAN or GERAN network.\nIf CSFB is configured for a UE, the TAI and MMEC (mapped to PS-NRI) should be operator coordinated so that additional signalling can be avoided. In any case the TAI and MMEC (mapped to PS-NRI) coordinated with another operator than the selected CS domain operator of the UE is not allowed.\nCS/PS coordination is achieved by allocating to the UE, an NRI for the CS domain and an NRI for the PS domain that together with LAI and RAI respectively indicates the same operator in the shared network.\nAt LA/RA update the RNC/BSC routes the NAS message to the operator that is defined by NRI, even if NRI is created in a PLMN different from Common PLMN.\nIn figure A.1 below operators A, B and C have both shared and dedicated networks, operator D has only dedicated network and operator E only shared network.\nFigure A.1: Shared and Dedicated network example\nIn the above, one or more of the operators in the shared network may deploy Iu-Flex or A/Gb-Flex between that shared radio access network and their core networks. Additionally, operators may deploy Iu-Flex or A/Gb-Flex within their dedicated core networks. For non-supporting UEs, operator coordination of the CS-NRI and LAI tuple and PS-NRI/MMEC and RAI/TAI tuple is needed not only within the shared network, but also between the shared network and the dedicated networks.\nA.2\tAlternatives for NRI split in UTRAN and GERAN\nSharing operators need to coordinate the used NRI, following alternatives are considered:\n1)\teven split of NRI space, 1…3 most significant bits of NRI is used to identify the CN operator.\n2)\tindividual NRI values used to identify the CN operator.\nAlternative 1; even split of NRI space\n31\n30\n29\n28\n27\n26\n25\n24\n23\n22\n21\n20\n19\n18\n17\n16\n15\n14\n13\n12\n11\n10\n9\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\nCS/PS\n'VLR-restart'\nCN operator ID\nNon shared NRI for CN operator internal use.\nA calculation for the possible number of subscribers in this scenario is:\n-\tWith max 4 sharing CN operators, two most significant bits of NRI is required to identify the CN operator.\n-\t3 bits are used for the restart counter.\n-\t5 bits of NRI allows 32 independent NRI values for each CN operator.\n-\tThis leaves 20 bits for every MSC that is 1 M non-purged TMSI.\nThe following aspects need to be considered for this solution:\n-\tIf more bits are needed for the restart counter or CN operator ID, each additional bit reduces the available TMSI space half.\n-\tThe basic configuration allows 32 M TMSI values for each CN operator, a lot of TMSI values are wasted if some sharing partners have substantially less subscribers than others.\n-\tIt may not be feasible in large networks that use Iu-Flex or A/Gb-Flex for load balancing (see Annex A, network configuration examples in TS 23.236 [8]).\n-\tThe number of NRI bits used for CN operator ID may need to be fixed in the initial planning. Otherwise configuration of all existing nodes must be changed when new partners join the shared network.\nAlternative 2; individual NRI values used to identify the CN operator\nThis could be considered in the case where a network is shared between one big and many small CN operators.\n31\n30\n29\n28\n27\n26\n25\n24\n23\n22\n21\n20\n19\n18\n17\n16\n15\n14\n13\n12\n11\n10\n9\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\nCS/PS\n'VLR-restart'\nShared NRI space.\n-\tThe biggest CN operator who needs more pool areas and TMSI space takes NRI values 32…63, [1xxxxx], this means 32M TMSI values when 4 bit is used for restart counter.\n-\tRest of shared NRI space is allocated to other CN operators in blocks of 4M TMSI values like NRI = 28 - 31 [0111xx], 24 - 27 [0110xx] …. 0 – 3 [000xx]. Initially gaps can be left between allocated NRI range that can be used for expansion.\nFollowing aspects need to be considered for this solution:\n-\tIf more bits are needed for the restart counter or NRI, each additional bit reduces the available TMSI space half.\n-\tThe initial planning of NRI length should take into account the pool area configurations of all sharing operators.\nTMSI per LA:\nTaking the example configurations mentioned above but changing the TMSI allocation per LA would result in an increase of the addressing space, then the same TMSI value can be used multiple times in the same VLR. More considerations with this TMSI per LA approach can be found in TS 23.236 [8].\nA.3\tNRI and CS/PS coordination in GWCN\nFor GWCN, the BSC and RNC determines a serving CN operator for a non-supporting UE based on the principles defined in clause 4.2.5.3, such that determined CN operator outcome (deterministic outcome) is the same in CS and PS domain.\nWhen source network determines target CN operator in handover and CS fallback, the NRI and MMEC coordination is required as for MOCN (see clause A.1) within the shared network and operator coordination of the CS-NRI and LAI tuple and PS-NRI/MMEC and RAI/TAI tuple between the shared network and the dedicated networks of the sharing partners:\n-\tto achieve that a non-supporting UE in visited PLMN will not change network due to LA/RA update;\n-\tto achieve that non-supporting UE in visited PLMN becomes CS/PS coordinated.\nA.4\tCSPS Coordination\nIn figure A.4-1 an example is given how the CSPS coordination can be handled, see also clause 4.2.5.3.\nFigure A.4-1: Flow diagram for CSPS Coordination\nA.\tWhen the target RAN node receives an idle mode signalling (Attach Request/Routeing Area Update Request/Location Area Update Request messages) from a UE it routes the request to a CN node based on the NRI provided by the UE. For MOCN an operator is thereby selected. For GWCN an operator is selected by the CN node. The RAN stores the NRI received from the UE.\nB.\tIf the UE can be served by the selected CN operator the UE is kept. A 'Redirection Completed' indication shall then be included in the response to the RAN node and the procedure ends. In the following cases the CN operator can serve the UE:\n1.\tThe UE is a non-roaming subscriber of the selected CN operator.\n2.\tThe UE is already served by the selected CN operator (e.g. periodic updates or mobility within a pool).\n3.\tThe RAN node indicates a RAN selected CN operator and the selected CN operator is serving the UE in the opposite domain.\nC.\tIf the UE is not kept by the selected CN operator then 'Redirection Indication' with 'CS/PS coordination Required' and IMSI is included in the response to the RAN node. Old LAI (for the CS domain) or old RAI (for the PS domain) or an indication whether the UE is attaching in the current domain, is also included in the response.\nD.\tIf the UE is under operator coordination, the RAN node selects a core node of the identified operator and forwards the message accordingly. The procedure ends.\nNOTE 1:\tIf the UE is under operator coordination and is both CS and PS registered in the source network, this operator is kept and CS/PS coordination is achieved.\nHowever, in conditions valid for step E and if the UE lacks CS registration in the source network (e.g. as with source LTE and no SGs registration) then achieving a successful CS/PS coordination and keeping the same serving operator as in the source network will be dependent upon the access to the information about the source network PS domain registration. For that reason it becomes necessary to check if the UE is registered in the PS domain (see step E) and if so register with that operator also in the CS domain. For example at cell reselection from a source LTE to a target GERAN network without DTM there will, during CS registration, be no registration in the PS domain within the shared target network. Therefore a check must also been done in all possible source networks of the sharing operators otherwise users may become CS/PS uncoordinated. The lack of CS registration in the source network implies an initial CS attach in the target network and therefore step E will be performed.\nA similar situation can occur when the UE lacks PS registration (as with no Data roaming for the UE) but for normal cases the UE is already registered in the target shared network in the CS domain when the PS registration occur. Checking in the source networks is then not necessary.\nE.\tIf the UE is not under operator coordination, or if the UE is making an initial attach, the RAN node sends requests to all connected CN nodes or by a possible optimization to one CN node per operator in the opposite domain in the target shared network, to inquire if the UE is served by the opposite domain. To not risk a change of serving operator for cases described in step D (i.e. when attaching to CS domain) then it is also necessary to check in the all MMEs that may hold the UEs context, of the sharing operators, if the UE is registered in the PS domain. Checking the source MMEs is done by relaying requests from target RAN via the CN in the target shared network. However in deployments where these cases are not applicable (e.g. always CS registration in source networks) or when it is sufficient to achieve CS/PS coordination, then the source networks need not to be checked.\nNOTE 2:\tChecking CN nodes in the opposite domain in the target shared network is also used at e.g. CS and PS Handover when the UE is not under operator coordination. For such cases the idle mode domain registration needs to select the same operator as is already in use for the connected domain.\nF1.\tIf the UE is registered in the opposite domain then the RAN node retrieves the PLMN of that registered operator and selects the same operator for the current domain. The procedure ends.\nF2.\tIf the UE is not registered in the opposite domain then the RAN node selects operator based on the IMSI analysis. The procedure ends.\nIf during execution of step D or E, a registration in the opposite domain occurs, then the RAN node can optionally select as follows:\n-\tIf the UE is registered in the opposite domain and is under operator coordination and is not performing an initial attach, then the RAN node, for both domains, selects serving operator based on the registration information from the opposite domain.\n-\tIf the UE is registered in the opposite domain and is not under operator coordination or is attaching, but with regards to the current domain the UE:\n-\tis under operator coordination and is not performing an initial attach, then the RAN node, for both domains, selects serving operator based on the registration information applicable to the current domain.\n-\tis not under operator coordination or is attaching then the RAN node, for both domains, selects serving operator based on IMSI analysis.\nFor parallel registrations in the CS and PS domains the above means that CS/PS coordination is achieved and that serving operator is kept.\nAnnex B (normative):Interaction with other network capabilities\nB.1\tGeneral\nThe provision of services and service capabilities in a network should not be restricted by the existence of network sharing. Therefore, all new features (or enhancements to existing features) should be specified to work in network sharing environments. If it is not possible to specify complete support for Network Sharing (i.e. PLMNs in a Shared Network has the same features/capabilities and the same operational situation as a stand alone PLMN) then such deviations are documented in this Annex.\nB.2\tSupport for RAN sharing for CSG and hybrid cells\nA cell with closed/hybrid access can only broadcast one CSG ID but may broadcast several PLMN IDs. If a cell with closed/hybrid access broadcasts several PLMNs (see clauses 5.2 and 5.2a) for a UE supporting shared network or a non-supporting UE that performs the PLMN selection (see clause 4.2.3.2), it is the operator responsibility to coordinate the CSG IDs between the operators' PLMNs.\nFor handover into a shared hybrid or shared CSG cell, the source RAN shall determine a target core network operator for which the UE is a CSG member since otherwise the handover is likely to fail. In case the UE is capable of reporting the subset of the broadcasted PLMN IDs in the target cell to which its CSG membership is verified, the source RAN bases its core network operator selection on this information. If this information is not reported by the UE the selection of a target core network operator is based on pre-configured information in the RAN.\nNOTE:\tTo ensure that handovers do not fail due to the source RAN selecting a core network operator for which the UE is not a CSG member in the case when the UE only reports the Primary PLMN-ID (E-UTRAN) as described in TS 36.331 [11] or no PLMN ID (UTRAN), the following RAN configuration can be used. The source RAN is configured with all broadcasted PLMN identities of neighbouring shared hybrid and closed access mode CSG cells, so that this data can be retrieved based on the UE-provided information (ECGI/TAC/CSG ID in E-UTRAN and Cell ID in UTRAN) of the target H(e)NB. The source RAN determines a target PLMN ID from the Handover Restriction List (HRL, see TS 36.413 [14]) in E-UTRAN or Shared Network Area (SNA) access information (see TS 25.413 [13]) in UTRAN. If HRL or SNA are not supported, local configuration in the RAN could be used. For a target cell, the allowed PLMN identities according to CSG membership should be the same as the allowed PLMN identities for handover because otherwise handovers can fail. If the target is hybrid cell and the UE is not a CSG member, the handover may be solved in the same way.\nFor further details on Closed Subscriber Group (CSG) and closed/hybrid access, see TS 36.300 [10] and TS 25.467 [17].\nAnnex C (informative):Change History\nChange history\nDate\nMeeting\nTDoc\nCR\nRev\nCat\nSubject/Comment\nNew version\n2011-09\nSP-53\nSP-110457\n0034\n5\nB\nIntroduction of FULL-MOCN-GERAN feature\n11.0.0\n2012-03\nSP-55\nSP-120088\n0037\n2\nB\nSRVCC and Network Sharing from E-UTRAN\n11.1.0\n2012-03\nSP-55\nSP-120088\n0039\n-\nD\nEditorial corrections on redirection message for Non-supporting UEs in a MOCN configuration\n11.1.0\n2012-03\nSP-55\nSP-120079\n0040\n1\nB\nIntroduction of FULL-MOCN-GERAN feature\n11.1.0\n2012-03\nSP-55\nSP-120079\n0043\n1\nC\nFULL-MOCN-GERAN support\n11.1.0\n2012-03\nSP-55\nSP-120088\n0045\n2\nB\nEAB for network sharing\n11.1.0\n2012-06\nSP-56\nSP-120251\n0046\n2\nF\nSupport for RAN sharing for CSG and hybrid cells\n11.2.0\n2012-06\nSP-56\nSP-120237\n0051\n2\nA\nSRVCC and Network Sharing\n11.2.0\n2012-06\nSP-56\nSP-120251\n0053\n2\nF\nEAB overload control from CN to RAN for UTRAN/GERAN in shared networks\n11.2.0\n2012-06\nSP-56\nSP-120248\n0054\n1\nB\nrSRVCC in network sharing with LTE to CS and back to LTE\n11.2.0\n2012-06\nSP-56\nSP-120251\n0060\n1\nF\nNetwork Sharing Corrections for SRVCC\n11.2.0\n2012-06\nSP-56\nSP-120246\n0061\n2\nF\nCorrections for MOCN GERAN\n11.2.0\n2012-06\nSP-56\nSP-120251\n0062\n2\nB\nGWCN for GERAN\n11.2.0\n2012-06\nSP-56\nSP-120252\n0063\n3\nB\nSIRIG support in shared networks\n11.2.0\n2012-06\nSP-56\nSP-120246\n0064\n1\nB\nSelection of PLMN for the CS Domain in CSFB towards a shared GERAN\n11.2.0\n2012-06\nSP-56\nSP-120239\n0068\n4\nF\nEAB in shared networks\n11.2.0\n2012-09\nSP-57\nSP-120486\n0057\n6\nF\nNetwork Sharing Corrections following review of GWCN UTRAN\n11.3.0\n2012-09\nSP-57\nSP-120483\n0074\n-\nF\nImpact of SIRIG on the BSS in a shared network\n11.3.0\n2012-12\nSP-58\nSP-120726\n0059\n5\nF\nGWCN UTRAN and charging\n11.4.0\n2012-12\nSP-58\nSP-120902\n0067\n8\nF\nNetwork sharing impact on the CSFB\n11.4.0\n2012-12\nSP-58\nSP-120722\n0077\n5\nF\nUsing NRI for CS/PS coordination\n11.4.0\n2012-12\nSP-58\nSP-120724\n0078\n1\nF\nIncorrect definition of Anchor PLMN\n11.4.0\n2012-12\nSP-58\nSP-120722\n0080\n3\nC\nIndicating selected PLMN to target BSC during handover\n11.4.0\n2012-12\nSP-58\nSP-120710\n0085\n-\nA\nHPLMN needs to be unaware of network sharing in VPLMN\n11.4.0\n2013-03\nSP-59\nSP-130085\n0086\n2\nF\nFurther consideration on the network sharing impact on the CSFB\n11.5.0\n2013-03\nSP-59\nSP-130085\n0087\n2\nF\nCDRs needs to reflect whether the core network operator was selected by a UE or allocated by the network to a UE\n11.5.0\n2013-03\nSP-59\nSP-130085\n0089\n4\nC\nIndicating selected PLMN to target BSC during handover\n11.5.0\n2013-12\nSP-62\nSP-130523\n0095\n2\nF\nRNC functionality in GWCN deployments\n11.6.0\n2013-12\nSP-62\nSP-130534\n0096\n5\nF\nCore Network Operator selection origin\n12.0.0\n2013-12\nSP-62\nSP-130536\n0097\n2\nF\nSupport of inbound mobility to a shared CSG cell\n12.0.0\n2014-06\nSP-64\nSP-140262\n0099\n2\nB\nMaster eNB is responsible to select Secondary eNBs compliant to network sharing agreements\n12.1.0\n2014-06\nSP-64\nSP-140377\n0100\n3\nF\nExchange of PLMN identities in Shared Networks\n12.1.0\n2014-12\nSP-66\nSP-140692\n0101\n2\nC\nCSPS Coordination General Description\n13.0.0\n2014-12\nSP-66\nSP-140692\n0102\n1\nC\nExample signalling flows\n13.0.0\n2014-12\nSP-66\nSP-140692\n0103\n1\nC\nExample logics for CSPS Coordination\n13.0.0\n2014-12\nSP-66\nSP-140692\n0104\n1\nC\nFunctional description\n13.0.0\n2015-03\nSP-67\nSP-150026\n0105\n3\nC\nCSPS Coordination Annex A.1 and A.3 updates\n13.1.0\n2016-06\nSP-72\nSP-160288\n0106\n1\nF\nRemoving CS/PS-NRI signalling from MSC/SGSN to RNC/BSC\n13.2.0\n2017-03\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-14 version (MCC)\n14.0.0\n2017-09\nSP-77\nSP-170723\n0107\n2\nC\nEUTRAN sharing enhancement alignment\n14.1.0\n2018-06\nSP-80\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-15 version (MCC)\n15.0.0\n2018-09\nSP-81\nSP-180729\n0108\n2\nF\nDefinition of Primary PLMN ID\n15.1.0\n2020-07\nSP-88E\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-16 version (MCC)\n16.0.0\n2022-03\nSP-95E\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-17 version (MCC)\n17.0.0\n2024-03\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-18 version (MCC)\n18.0.0",
