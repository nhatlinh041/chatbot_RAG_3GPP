However for the overall stage 2 procedures of IMS see 3GPP TS 23.228 [1].\nThe protocol on the Mp interface is defined to comply with ITU-T H.248.1 Gateway Control Protocol; see [3].The goal of this specification is to provide the input to defining a formal Profile within the H.248 protocol toolbox specifically for the Mp application.",

SDP simulcast negotiation decides which simulcast formats, if any, are sent between the conference participant and the MRFP.\nFurthermore, the media level SDP attribute \"a=content\" (defined in IETF RFC 4796 [59]) is used to indicate content of RTP stream.\nThe main video SDP \"m=\" line is indicated by the \"a=content:main\" under that \"m=\" line. The screenshare video is indicated as a separate SDP video \"m=\" line, identified by \"a=content:slides\" under that \"m=\" line. The screenshare video \"m=\" line shall be listed after the main video \"m=\" line. The \"thumbnail\" video is defined as unidirectional video which can be offered under the main video \"m=\" line with a smaller resolution then a main video or as a separate \"m=\" line that is not the first video \"m=\" line in the SDP, and that is also not identified with any \"a=content:main\" or \"a=content:slides\".\nNOTE:\tA typical use case for MMCMH is that each conference participant sends a main and a thumbnail video, and that receives one main video (depicting the current speaker) and thumbnail videos for all other or some of the conference participants. For the current speaker, the MRF typically passes the main video to everybody. For each other participant, the MRF typically passes a thumbnail video to all other participants.\nThe main audio SDP \"m=\" line shall be the first \"m=\" line in an SDP offer, to increase the probability that it is accepted by a non-MMCMH capable conference participant. Support for multiple, simultaneous audio streams is indicated in SDP as separate audio \"m=\" lines. The number of supported channels in multi-channel audio is indicated per audio stream through the SDP \"m=\" line <encoding parameters>, with the default being a single channel when <encoding parameters> is omitted. The additional audio \"m=\" lines shall be listed after the main audio \"m=\" line.\n\"RTP-level pause and resume\" functionality shall be supported by conference participants supporting MMCMH feature. The following RTCP feedback \"CCM PAUSE-RESUME\" messages are defined in IETF RFC 7728 [62]:\n-\t\"PAUSE\" message to request an RTP stream sender to pause an RTP stream;\n-\t\"RESUME\" message to request an RTP stream sender to resume an RTP stream;\n-\t\"REFUSED\" message to notify an RTP stream receiver that a pause or resume request is not accepted; and\n-\t\"PAUSED\" message to inform an RTP stream receiver that an RTP stream is paused.\nUsage of \"RTP-level pause and resume\" functionality is negotiated via SDP offer/answer exchange through an extension of RTCP feedback capability attribute \"a=rtcp-fb\" (defined in IETF RFC 4585 [60]) to include request for pause and resume, as specified in IETF RFC 7728 [62]. The use of the \"RTP-level pause and resume\" functionality can be restricted according to a \"config\" pause attribute (defined in IETF RFC 7728 [62]), including not using it at all if that is the SDP offer/answer negotiation outcome.\nFloor Control function using BFCP (as specified in clause 5.14) to control main video and screenshare video shall be supported by conference participants supporting MMCMH feature.\nExamples of media portions from possible SDP offers and SDP answers related to a multi-stream multiparty conference establishment using simulcast and RTP-level pause and resume signalling are given in 3GPP TS 26.114 [23] annex T.\nIf the MRFC and the MRFP support the MMCMH feature, the requirements and procedures in the following clauses apply.",

The option of DTLS-over-TCP is not supported (despite the fact that the CLUE data channel is based on the framework of WebRTC data channels).\n3)\tFor the protocol termination of SCTP in the MRFP:\na)\tthe protocol parameter configuration for the SCTP is done via configuration management or default value settings, apart from the information elements (specified in clause 5.22.3) which are signalled between the MRFC and the MRFP using the SDP for SCTP;\n4)\tRegarding the establishment procedures for DTLS and SCTP:\na)\tthe establishment of a SCTP association is tightly coupled to the successful establishment of the underlying DTLS session/connection;\nb)\tonly an immediate SCTP establishment is supported;\nNOTE 2:\tHence, an explicit information element for triggering the sending of an outgoing SCTP establishment request is not required.\nc)\tthe MRFP will immediately send an outgoing SCTP establishment request (SCTP INIT) when DTLS layer connectivity is available, if the MRFP did not already receive an incoming SCTP establishment request;\n5)\tRegarding the procedure for closing the CLUE data channel:\nNOTE 3:\tThe closure procedure according to clause 3.2.7 of IETF RFC 8850 [49] is not supported (because the correspondent \"SCTP reset message\" cannot be explicitly triggered by the MRFC.\na)\tthe MRFP will deny during the SCTP association establishment phase the negotiation of SCTP extensions (such as the SCTP stream reset capability) in order to prevent their later usage for a closure procedure; and\nb)\ta CLUE data channel is released by a removal of the H.248 stream endpoint or the subtraction of the H.248 termination, or a release procedure of the DTLS bearer session.

      "content": "Figure 6.2.10.2.7.1.1 shows an example of H.248 Context model for a multi-stream multiparty conference when the MRFC and the MRFP support the MMCHM feature and the floor control server functionality is embedded in the MRFP. Four users (A, B, C and D) participate in a conference and each user supports simulcast sending of a main video (one RTP video stream in high resolution and the other RTP video stream in low resolution), sending and receiving of a screenshare video, and a floor control using BFCP over TCP. In addition, the user A and the user D support receiving of one thumbnail video, and the user B and the user C support receiving of two thumbnail videos. The users A, B and C support simulcast sending of two audio RTP streams which are encoded using different codecs (e.g. one RTP audio stream is AMR-WB encoded and the other EVS encoded).\nA conference consists of one context with terminations representing connections to the users. Each termination within the context supports: one audio media stream (S1), one video media stream for main video (S2), one video media stream for screenshare video (S3), one or more video media streams for thumbnail videos (S4 and S5), and one media stream for floor control protocol signalling (S6).\nVideo media streams S2 are configured with simulcast property and supports 3 simulcast RTP video streams: two simulcast RTP video streams (SC1 and SC3) with \"recv\" property and one RTP video stream (SC2) with \"send\" property towards the users. Video media streams S3 for screenshare video are configured with \"sendrecv\" property. Video media streams S4 and S5 for thumbnail videos are configured with \"sendonly\" property towards the users. In addition, video media streams S2, S3, S4 and S5 are configured with \"RTP-level pause and resume\" property.\nIn the example shown in figure 6.2.10.2.7.1.1 audio media streams S1 on terminations T2 and T3 are configured with:\n-\tsimulcast property and supports 3 simulcast RTP audio streams: two simulcast RTP audio streams (SC1 and SC3) with \"recv\" property and one RTP audio stream (SC2) with \"send\" property towards the users; and\n-\t\"RTP-level pause and resume\" property.\nMedia stream S6 for floor control protocol signalling (BFCP over TCP) is configured with two separate floors: floor FL1 is used to control the audio and the main video (and thus associated with media streams S1 and S2) and floor FL2 is used to control the screenshare video (and thus associated with media stream S3).\nThe MMCMH interworking function (IWF) depicted in the context C1 symbolizes that the MRFP interworks media streams in that context according to the MMCMH policies defined in clause 5.11.3.5.\nFigure 6.2.10.2.7.1.1: H.248 Context model for Multi-stream multiparty conference",

      "content": "The signalling flow shown in figures 6.2.10.2.7.2.1 and 6.2.10.2.7.2.2 gives an example for a multi-stream multiparty conference establishment (\"dial-in\" conference procedure) when \"simulcast\" and \"RTP-level pause and resume\" signalling for media endpoints are supported by the MRFC and the MRFP.\nFigure 6.2.10.2.7.2.1: Multi-stream multiparty conference establishment (\"dial-in\" procedure) with support of \"simulcast\" and \"RTP-level pause and resume\"\nFigure 6.2.10.2.7.2.2: Multi-stream multiparty conference establishment (\"dial-in\" procedure) with support of \"simulcast\" and \"RTP-level pause and resume\" (message sequence chart continue)\nThis procedure is identical to that of clause 6.2.10.2.2 apart from the MRFC provides simulcast formats to the MRFP according to 3GPP TS 26.114 [23] annex S, IETF RFC 8853 [57] and IETF RFC 8851 [58], and \"RTP-level pause and resume\" signalling according to IETF RFC 7728 [62] for multi-stream multiparty conference media handling.\nThe procedure in the figures 6.2.10.2.7.2.1 and 6.2.10.2.7.2.2 is described step-by-step with an emphasis on the additional aspects for the MRFC and the MRFP of the multi-stream multiparty conference media handling.\n1.\tThe MRFC receives a trigger to create an ad-hoc MMCMH conference from the end user (e.g. user A from figure 6.2.10.2.7.1.1). The received SDP offer includes:\na)\tan audio \"m=\" line with the \"a=simulcast\" attribute and the corresponding \"a=rid\" lines with a \"pt\" parameter defining the simulcast stream identification (in this example simulcast sending of two audio RTP streams which are encoded using codec1 and codec2 [rid-id values 0 and 2], and reception of one RTP audio stream which may be decoded using codec1 or codec2 [rid-id values 1 or 3]);\nb) a video \"m=\" line with the \"a=content:main\" attribute, the \"a=simulcast\" attribute and the corresponding \"a=rid\" lines with a \"pt\" parameter defining the simulcast stream identification (in this example simulcast sending of RTP video stream in high resolution [rid-id value 0] and in low resolution [rid-id value 1], and reception of RTP video stream [rid-id value 2] in high resolution, the \"a=rtcp-fb\" line(s) with a \"CCM\" parameter, a \"pause\" CCM parameter and a \"nowait\" pause attribute;\nc)\ta video \"m=\" line with the \"a=content:slides\" attribute indicating sending and receiving of a screenshare video;\nd)\ta video \"m=\" line with the \"a=imageattr\" attribute indicating receiving of RTP video stream in low resolution;\ne)\ta BFCP \"m=\" line indicating support of a floor control client role; and\nf)\ta session level \"a=ccc_list\" attribute (defined in 3GPP TS 26.114 [23], clause S.5.7.2) with the concurrent codec capabilities of the conference participant.\n2.\tBased on the local configuration and the received session level \"a=ccc_list\" SDP attribute the MRFC selects the payload type and simulcast formats from the received SDP offer for each accepted audio and video media stream and creates the corresponding media stream identities. The MRFC creates one media stream for floor control protocol signalling. In this example the MRFC creates:\na)\tone audio media stream (StreamID = 1);\nb)\tone video media stream for main video (StreamID = 2);\nc)\tone video media stream for screenshare video (StreamID = 3);\nd)\tone media stream for thumbnail video (StreamID = 4); and\ne)\tone media stream for floor control using BFCP protocol signalling (StreamID = 6).\n3. – 5.\tThe MRFC uses the \"Reserve and Configure IMS resources\" procedure to request the MRFP to configure resources towards the user and for the accepted audio and video media streams (in this example StreamID values 1, 2, 3 and 4) the MRFC:\na)\tif the user is the first conference participant, requests the MRFP to create a new context and includes a \"MMCMH policy\" information element to indicate to the MRFP that the context is used for MMCMH and that the MRFP shall mix RTP media streams autonomously based on the MMCMH policies specified in clause 5.11.3.5;\nb)\tprovides an IP address and port received from the user;\nc)\trequests a local IP address and port;\nd)\tincludes selected payload types in \"Local IMS resources\" and \"Remote IMS resources\" information elements;\ne)\tfor the video media streams where the \"a=content\" attribute was received in the SDP offer, includes in the Local and Remote descriptors a \"Stream content\" information element with the received \"a=content\" attribute to indicate content of stream;\nf)\tfor the audio and video media streams with the simulcast streams includes in the Local and Remote descriptors a \"Simulcast desc\" information element (containing the \"a=simulcast\" attribute) with the selected simulcast streams and request the MRFP to configure termination with a simulcast capability;\ng)\tfor the audio and video media streams with the simulcast streams includes in the Local and Remote descriptors a \"Simulcast format\" information element with the accepted \"a=rid\" attribute lines;\nh)\tfor the audio and video media streams where the \"a=rtcp-fb\" line(s) with a \"CCM\" parameter was received in the SDP offer, includes in the Local and Remote descriptors:\n-\ta \"CCM pause-resume\" information element to indicate to the MRFP which RTCP feedback \"CCM PAUSE-RESUME\" messages the MRFP may send to the end user;\n-\tif a \"nowait\" pause attribute was received in the SDP offer, include the \"nowait\" pause attribute in the \"CCM pause-resume\" information element to indicate to the MRFP that exchange of the RTCP feedback \"CCM PAUSE-RESUME\" messages will be point-to-point and no hold-off period will therefore be necessary when resuming paused streams;\n-\tan \"Autonomous request\" information element to indicate that the MRFP is allowed to autonomously send RTCP feedback CCM PAUSE and RESUME messages; and\n-\tan \"Autonomous response\" information element to indicate that the MRFP is allowed to autonomously send RTCP feedback CCM PAUSED and REFUSED messages; and\ni)\tfor the video media streams where the \"a=imageattr\" attribute was received in the SDP offer, includes a \"Generic image attribute\" information element in accordance to procedure specified in clause 6.2.17; and\nj)\tincludes in the Remote descriptor a \"Concurrent Codec Capabilities\" information element to indicate the concurrent codec capabilities of the conference participant.\nUpon request from the MRFC, the MRFP creates:\na)\tif the user is the first conference participant, a new context and configure it according to value(s) received within the \"MMCMH policy\" information element; and\nb)\tan incoming termination and configure it with the simulcast property.\nThe MRFP reserves resources for the received audio and media streams. In this example, the MRFP reserves the local IP address and port, and IMS resources (codecs and codec's configurations) for one audio media stream and for the three video media streams and provide the requested information to the MRFC. The MRFP configures termination:\na)\tto receive the two simulcast audio RTP streams and to send one audio RTP stream and which are encoded using codec1 or codec2 (StreamID with value 1);\nb)\twith the voice activity detection functionality;\nc)\tto receive the two simulcast video RTP streams (one RTP video stream in high resolution and the other RTP video stream in low resolution) and to send one RTP video stream in high resolution and which are encoded using codec3 (StreamID with value 2); and\nd)\tto support the full \"RTP-level pause and resume\" functionality corresponding to \"config=1\" on all audio and video media streams.\n6. - 8.\tThe MRFC uses the \"Configure Conference For Floor Control\" procedure (specified in clause 6.2.13.2.2) to request the MRFP to configure context C1 with a Floor Control Server property. The MRFC provides in a \"Conference Identifier\" information element the Conference Identity \"555\" to be used by BFCP floor control signalling, includes a \"Floor-Resource Associations\" information element to indicate to the MRFP that two floors will be used within the context C1:\na)\tfloor with identity \"333\" will be used to control the audio and the main video (and thus associated with StreamID with values 1 and 2); and\nb)\tfloor with identity \"444\" will be used to control the screenshare video (and thus associated with StreamID with value 3),\nand includes a \"Floor Control Algorithm\" information element to indicate to the MRFP the algorithm used in granting the floor for each floor identity.\nThe MRFC uses the \"Configure BFCP Termination\" procedure to modify the termination to support BFCP over TCP media stream (StreamID with value 6) in accordance to procedure specified in clause 6.2.13.2.2. The MRFC provides an IP address and port received from the user and requests a local IP address and port from the MRFP. The MRFC includes an \"User Identifier information\" element indicating user identity and an \"Available Floors\" information element indicating the floor identities to be used for BFCP signalling.\nIf the MRFP needs to act as a TCP client, the MRFC requests the MRFP to start a TCP connection establishment with an \"Establish TCP connection\" information element. The MRFC includes a \"Notify TCP connection establishment Failure Event\" information element to request the MRFP to report an unsuccessful TCP connection set-up.\nIf the MRFC and the MRFP support IMS media plane security, they will apply additional procedures as specified in clause 6.2.19.3.\n9.\tThe MRFC inserts in the SDP answer the IP address and RTP port received from the MRFP for the accepted media streams and includes in the SDP answer:\n-\tif the simulcast streams were included in the SDP offer, the accepted simulcast streams;\n-\tif an \"a=rtcp-fb\" line with a \"pause\" CCM parameter was included in the SDP offer for the accepted media stream, an \"a=rtcp-fb\" line with a \"pause\" CCM parameter and \"nowait\" pause attribute;\n-\tan \"a=floorctrl:s-only\" to indicate that the MRFP will act as a floor control server;\n-\tan \"a=confid\" attribute indicating the conference identity to be used by BFCP signalling;\n-\tan \"a=userid\" attribute indicating the user identity to be used by BFCP signalling;\n-\t\"a=floorid\" attribute lines containing the BFCP floor identities (\"333\" which will be used to control main audio and main video media streams and \"444\" which will be used to control the screenshare video);\n-\t\"a=label\" attribute lines indicating which audio and video media streams will be BFCP controlled; and\n-\tan \"a=setup:active\" attribute to indicate that the MRFP will act as a TCP client.\n10.\tThe MRFC inserts in the SIP message (200 (OK) final response or 18x provisional response to the SIP INVITE request) an \"isfocus\" media feature tag and the SDP answer, and sends the SIP message towards the user.",

The procedure in the figure 6.2.19.2.1.1 for requesting e2e security for a media stream is described step-by-step with an emphasis on the additional aspects for the MRFC and the MRFP of the e2e media protection using TLS and KMS.\n1.\tDepending on the KMS and a local policy, the IMS UE-A will either interact with the KMS to obtain keys and a MIKEY-TICKET ticket usable for the MRFC, or it will create the ticket by itself.\nThe IMS UE-A generates the TRANSFER_INIT message according to IETF RFC 6043 [33] containing the ticket associated with the MRFC. A single Crypto Session is included in the TRANSFER_INIT message as described in Annex H.3 of 3GPP TS 33.328 [31]. The protocol type in the Crypto Session is set to TLS.\nThe IMS UE-A creates an SDP offer with an MSRP based media over TLS transport protocol and inserts \"a=setup:actpass\" SDP attribute specified in IETF RFC 4145 [36] and key management protocol \"a=key-mgmt\" SDP attribute specified in IETF RFC 4567 [35] which indicates use of the MIKEY-TICKET ticket and contains the TRANSFER_INIT message encapsulated in a keymgmt-data field.\n2.\tThe IMS UE-A sends the SIP INVITE request with the SDP offer.\n3.\tUpon reception of the SIP INVITE request with the SDP offer containing a media stream that uses \"TCP/TLS/MSRP\" transport protocol, the MRFC checks for the presence of the key management protocol \"a=key-mgmt\" SDP attribute. If it indicates the usage of the MIKEY the MRFC extracts a key management data from a keymgmt-data field and \"base64\" decodes them to reconstruct the original TRANSFER_INIT message. The MRFC checks if it is authorized to resolve the ticket and if that is the case the MRFC interacts with the KMS to resolve the ticket and receive keys.\n4. - 6.\tThe MRFC uses the \"Reserve And Configure IMS resources\" procedure to request a termination for \"TCP/TLS/MSRP\" media. The MRFC provides an IP address and port received from the IMS UE-A and includes a Pre-Shared Key information element containing the derived PSK i.e. the Traffic-Encrypting Key associated with the Crypto Session that will be used by the MRFP in TLS handshake. The MRFC includes a Notify TCP connection establishment Failure Event information element to request the MRFP to report an unsuccessful TCP connection set-up and a Notify TLS session establishment Failure Event information element to request the MRFP to report an unsuccessful TLS session set-up. In accordance to the information in the \"a=setup\" SDP attribute that will be sent in an SDP answer the MFRC requests the MRFP to start a TCP connection establishment and to start a TLS session once the TCP connection is established.\n7.\tThe MRFP sends a TCP SYN message towards the IMS UE-A to establish a TCP connection. The IMS UE-A answers with a TCP SYN ACK message and the MRFP replies with a TCP ACK message, completing the TCP connection establishment.\n8.\tUpon completion of the TCP connection establishment, the MRFP starts a TLS session establishment using the received Pre-Shared Key information element to set-up a TLS-PSK tunnel to protect MSRP messages.\n9.\tThe MRFC includes the MIKEY-TICKET response in the TRANSFER_RESP message created according to IETF RFC 6043 [33]. The MRFC inserts the key management protocol \"a=key-mgmt\" SDP attribute which indicates use of the MIKEY-TICKET ticket and contains the \"base64\" encoded TRANSFER_RESP message. The TRANSFER_RESP message includes the information required for the generation of keys.\n10.\tThe MRFC sends the SIP 200 (OK) final response (or 18x provisional response) to the SIP INVITE request with the SDP answer to the IMS UE-A.\nAfter receiving the SIP 200 (OK) final response (or 18x provisional response) to the SIP INVITE request with the SDP answer the IMS UE-A extracts a key management data from the keymgmt-data field and \"base64\" decodes them to reconstruct the original TRANSFER-RESP message. The IMS UE-A verifies the TRANSFER-RESP message according to IETF RFC 6043 [33] and then verifies that the authenticated identity of the recipient corresponds to the policy for the MSRP session before completing the media security set-up.",

Depending on the KMS and a local policy, the MRFC will either interact with the KMS to obtain keys and a MIKEY-TICKET ticket usable for the IMS UE-B, or it will create the ticket by itself. In the latter case, MIKEY-TICKET mode 3 as specified in IETF RFC 6043 [33] is used, and the MRFC will then perform all key and ticket generation functions otherwise performed by the KMS.\nThe MRFC generates the TRANSFER_INIT message according to IETF RFC 6043 [33]. The identities of the initiator and the responder in the message are the KMS user identities derived from the URI's in the To and From header fields in the SIP INVITE request.\nA single Crypto Session is included in the TRANSFER_INIT message as described in Annex H.3 of 3GPP TS 33.328 [31]. The protocol type in the Crypto Session is set to TLS.\n2. - 4.\tThe MRFC uses the \"Reserve IMS resources\" procedure to request a termination for \"TCP/TLS/MSRP\" media towards the IMS UE-B.\n5.\tThe MRFC creates an SDP offer with an MSRP based media over TLS transport protocol and inserts the \"a=setup:actpass\" SDP attribute specified in IETF RFC 4145 [36] and the key management protocol \"a=key-mgmt\" SDP attribute specified in IETF RFC 4567 [35] which indicates the use of the MIKEY-TICKET ticket and contains the TRANSFER_INIT message encapsulated in a keymgmt-data field.\n6.\tThe MRFC sends the SIP INVITE request with the SDP offer to the IMS UE-B.\n7.\tUpon reception of the SIP INVITE request with the SDP offer containing a media stream that uses transport \"TCP/TLS/MSRP\", the IMS UE-B checks if it is authorized to resolve a ticket and if that is the case the IMS UE-B interacts with the KMS to resolve the ticket and receive keys.\n8.\tThe IMS UE-B includes the MIKEY-TICKET response in the TRANSFER_RESP message created according to IETF RFC 6043 [33]. The IMS UE-B inserts the key management protocol \"a=key-mgmt\" SDP attribute specified in IETF RFC 4567 [35].\nThe IMS UE-B sends the SIP 200 (OK) final response (or 18x provisional response) to the SIP INVITE request with an SDP answer.\n9. - 11.\tAfter receiving the SIP 200 (OK) final response (or 18x provisional response) to the SIP INVITE request with the SDP answer the MRFC extracts a key management data from the keymgmt-data field and \"base64\" decodes them to reconstruct the original TRANSFER-RESP message. The MRFC verifies the TRANSFER-RESP message according to IETF RFC 6043 [33] and then verifies that the authenticated identity of the recipient corresponds to the policy for the MSRP session before completing the media security set-up.\nThe MRFC uses the \"Configure IMS resources\" procedure to configure a termination towards the IMS UE-B with an IP address and port received from the IMS UE-B and includes a Pre-Shared Key information element containing the derived PSK i.e. the Traffic-Encrypting Key associated with the Crypto Session that will be used by the MRFP in TLS handshake. The MRFC includes a Notify TCP connection establishment Failure Event information element to request reporting of an unsuccessful TCP connection set-up and a Notify TLS session establishment Failure Event information element to request reporting of un unsuccessful TLS session set-up.\n12.\tThe IMS UE-B sends a TCP SYN message towards the MRFP to establish a TCP connection. The MRFP answers with a TCP SYN ACK message and the IMS UE-B replies with a TCP ACK message, completing the TCP connection establishment.\n13.\tUpon completion of the TCP connection establishment, the IMS UE-B starts a TLS session establishment using the received Pre-Shared Key information element to set-up a TLS-PSK tunnel to protect MSRP messages.",
