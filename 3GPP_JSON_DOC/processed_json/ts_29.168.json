A term defined in the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in 3GPP TR 21.905 [1].\nElementary Procedure: SBc-AP consists of Elementary Procedures (EPs). An Elementary Procedure is a unit of interaction between MME and CBC. These Elementary Procedures are defined separately and are intended to be used to build up complete sequences in a flexible manner. If the independence between some EPs is restricted, it is described under the relevant EP description. Unless otherwise stated by the restrictions, the EPs may be invoked independently of each other as stand alone procedures, which can be active in parallel. Examples on using several SBc-APs together with each other and EPs from other interfaces can be found in reference [FFS].\nAn EP consists of an initiating message and possibly a response message. Two kinds of EPs are used:\n-\tClass 1: Elementary Procedures with response (success and/or failure).\n-\tClass 2: Elementary Procedures without response.\nFor Class 1 EPs, the types of responses can be as follows:\nSuccessful:\n-\tA signalling message explicitly indicates that the elementary procedure successfully completed with the receipt of the response.\nUnsuccessful:\n-\tA signalling message explicitly indicates that the EP failed.\n-\tOn time supervision expiry (i.e. absence of expected response).\nSuccessful and Unsuccessful:\n-\tOne signalling message reports both successful and unsuccessful outcome for the different included requests. The response message used is the one defined for successful outcome.\nClass 2 EPs are considered always successful.",

If one IE needed to appear more than once in one object set, then the different occurrences have different IE ids):\n-\tIEs shall be ordered (in an IE container) in the order they appear in object set definitions.\n-\tObject set definitions specify how many times IEs may appear. An IE shall appear exactly once if the presence field in an object has value \"mandatory\". An IE may appear at most once if the presence field in an object has value \"optional\" or \"conditional\". If in a tabular format there is multiplicity specified for an IE (i.e. an IE list) then in the corresponding ASN.1 definition the list definition is separated into two parts. The first part defines an IE container list where the list elements reside. The second part defines list elements. The IE container list appears as an IE of its own. For this version of the standard an IE container list may contain only one kind of list elements.\nIf a SBC-AP message that is not constructed as defined above is received, this shall be considered as Abstract Syntax Error, and the message shall be handled as defined for Abstract Syntax error in clause 4.5.3.6.",
