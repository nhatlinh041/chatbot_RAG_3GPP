      "content": "The PN access control is one of the PNM applications specified in 3GPP TS 22.259 [1] that enables PN-users to exercise access control to restrict accesses to certain UE(s) of their PNs. The PN may consist of UEs which are only privately accessed, that is each UE may be accessed only by other UEs of the PN. The PN-User may additionally modify the access levels of each UE of the PN to be public or private. In this regard the PN behaves similar to a CUG as specified in 3GPP TS 22.085 [13] and 3GPP TS 23.085 [14], with Outgoing Access and whether Incoming Access is allowed for the PN UE is dependent on the PN access control list for that PN UE.\nIn order to perform such PN access control the PN-users need to configure a PN access control list for each UE of the PN. The configuration can be done either in a static or a dynamic way. Besides other additional information, the PN access control list of a UE within a PN contains all identities (e.g., a SIP URI) which are permitted to be used to initiate sessions to that UE. In this document, the UE of a PN that is used by the PN-user to exercise access control is referred to controller UE, whereas the UE of the PN, over which an access control is enabled, is referred to controllee UE. The controller UE of a PN-user’s PN is assigned by provisioning and the controller UE can configure any UE of the PN as controllee UE. The PN access control list of the controllee UE is only configurable by the controller UE.\nFigure 4.2-1: Relationship of various service profiles in PN access control\nAn example of the service profiles configuration for PN access control is shown in the above figure 4.2-1. The arrows indicate the direction of control. Some of the aspects involved are:\n-\tA PN-user's PN consists of two UEs, i.e., UE 1a and UE 1b, where UE 1b is the controllee UE and UE 1a is the controller UE.\n-\tThe service profile of UE 1b is referred to as the controllee UE Service Profile.\n-\tThe service profile of UE 1a is referred to as the controller UE Service Profile.\n-\tThe assignment of controller UE service profile is done during provisioning.\n-\tAccess control of UE 1b by UE 1a is performed with the help of a SIP Application Server (AS), referred to as PNM AS.\n-\tFrom UE 1a, the PN-user configures a PN access control list that contains details of PN access control regarding UE 1b's service profile. This configuration is done over the Ut interface. For example: this PN access control list can contain a list of UE identities that are allowed to initiate sessions with UE 1b.\n-\tThe PNM AS executes the actual PN access control procedures.\n-\tThe PNM AS performs PN access control by utilizing the PN access control list.\n-\tIf inadequate information present in the access control list to enable PN access control, the PNM AS can query the controller UE about the information with how to precede the received initial request.",

If the request does not originate from another PN UE within the same PN as the terminating PN UE the PNM AS shall invoke the PN access control application if it is enabled. If no access control list exists for the terminating UE, and if the PNM AS does not invoke the PN UE redirection for the terminating UE, the PNM AS sends the initial request to the terminating UE (i.e., a UE of a PN). Otherwise, the PNM AS verifies whether the originating UE of the initial request is a valid entry contained in the PN access control list for the terminating UE, before it initiates session towards the terminating UE. With a successful verification, the PNM AS sends the initial request to the terminating UE. With an unsuccessful verification, if the terminating UE is not a controllee UE, then the PNM AS rejects the initial request. If the terminating UE is a controllee UE, the PNM AS queries the controller UE whether the session to the controllee UE is allowed to be established. If it is allowed, and if the PNM AS does not invoke the PN UE redirection for the terminating UE, the PNM AS sends the initial request to the controllee UE. Otherwise, the PNM AS rejects the initial request.

The originating UE of the initial request needs not be aware of the setting of the access control done by PN-user 1.\n-\tPN-user 1has configured UE2 with user2_public@home2.net as the only entry in the access control list related to the controllee UE in this example. When the PNM AS receives initial requests not coming from UE2, the PNM AS can query the controller UE and the continuation of the initial request depends on the outcome of the query.\n-\tThe following table summarizes the above assumptions.\nTable 1: Example of a simple access control table PN\nPN Of user\ncontrollee UE\ncontroller UE\nAccess List entries\n(UE 1a) user1_public1@home1.net\nNo\nN/A\nN/A\n(UE 1b) user1_public2@home1.net\nYes\nUE 1a\n(UE 2) user2_public@home2.net\n<Network assumptions>\n-\tPN-user’s home network provides PN access control, which allows PN-users to configure identities (e.g., a SIP URI) which are permitted to initiate sessions to the UE of the PN.\n-\tThis service is hosted by the PNM Server which is a SIP application server, serving scscf#1.\n-\tFor simple illustration, in this example, both identities of the PN are shown to be registered with the same S-CSCF (S-CSCF#1) to improve efficiency in signalling, which might be the case in most implementations.\n-\tThe PNM AS stores access control lists of controllee UE and the controller UE can process access control requests during dynamic procedures.\nUE 3 sends an initial request to UE 1b (user1_public2@home1.net). But, UE 3 hasn’t been configured by the PN-user in the access control list. Therefore, the PN MAS queries the controller UE (i.e., UE 1a) about the information as to how to process this initial request.",

This may not be a scalable solution where tens of UEs may try to access the controllee UE. In order to solve this problem, the PN-user may configure a controller UE, after processing of this decision normal session initiation procedures may be continued. Once the controller UE has been chosen, to handle all session initiation requests from UEs whose identities are not configured in the access control list, a query can be directed to the particular controller UE.\nThe controller UE in turn is capable of checking the access control information of this query. Options may be given to the PN-user to either accept the call himself, or answer the query by allowing the call to go through to the intended destination (controllee UE) or deny the call. In addition the user may be given an option of saving this policy for future call requests by the same source. Once the user makes the decision, a response message carrying this information may be sent directing the session back to the original destination.\nThe PNM AS receives the response message from the S-CSCF. If the decision of the PN-user was to allow the call, it sends the original initial request message.
