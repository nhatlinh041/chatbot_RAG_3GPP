If data-reference is IPAddressSecureBindingInformation (22) and the User Identity is an IMS Public User Identity that is shared between multiple Private User Identities, Experimental-Result shall be set to DIAMETER_ERROR_OPERATION_NOT_ALLOWED in the Sh-Pull Response.\n4.\tCheck whether or not the data that is requested to be downloaded by the AS is currently being updated by another entity. If there is an update of the data in progress, the HSS may delay the Sh-Pull-Resp message until the update has been completed. The HSS shall ensure that the data returned is not corrupted by this conflict. If HSS is not able to delay the Sh-Pull-Resp message e.g. due to timeout the Experimental-Result-Code shall be set to DIAMETER_USER_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE.\n4a.\tIf T-ADS Information is requested, the HSS/UDM shall take into account information possibly received from MME ,SGSN, and/or AMF during the registration, location update or notification procedure, in order to decide whether MME, SGSN and/or AMF need to be contacted before a response is sent to the AS.\n-\tThe HSS/UDM shall provide the most recent IMS Voice over PS Sessions support indication as indicated by the serving nodes. The HSS/UDM shall provide the Access Type and RAT type, if available. The HSS/UDM may also provide the last UE activity time, if available which should include a specific timezone. See Annex E.\nNOTE 2:\tThe last UE activity time without a specific timezone can result in IMS receiving unexpected time if timezone is not included, especially for roaming to PLMN with different timezone.\n-\tIf all serving nodes need to be contacted, and if at least one serving node does not support T-ADS Data Retrieval or did not successfully answer to the T-ADS request from the HSS, the HSS shall indicate that IMS Voice over PS Sessions support is unknown, i.e., the HSS shall not indicate support, or non-support, of IMS Voice over PS Sessions unless all registered serving nodes have provided indication of their support, non-support, or detached status.\n-\tIf the HSS/UDM knows that one of the registered serving nodes is a Gn/Gp-SGSN, the HSS/UDM shall not contact the MME for T-ADS Data Retrieval, and shall provide the most recent IMS Voice over PS Sessions support indication as indicated by the Gn/Gp-SGSN and/or the AMF. If the Gn/Gp-SGSN needs to be contacted and it does not support T-ADS Data Retrieval, the HSS shall indicate IMS Voice over PS Sessions support is unknown.\nNOTE 3:\tIf the UE is registered with both MME and SGSN, and the HSS knows that the SGSN is a Gn/Gp-SGSN, the HSS does not need to know if the MME supports IMS Voice over PS Sessions or not. The HSS can determine that the SGSN registered is a Gn/Gp-SGSN by different ways, e.g. by configuration, or according to the information (e.g. EPS Subscription Data Not Needed Indicator) received in MAP_UpdateGPRSLocation request.\nNOTE 4:\tIf the UE is registered with both MME and SGSN, and the HSS is unable to know that the SGSN is a Gn/Gp-SGSN, the HSS will indicate IMS Voice over PS Sessions support as unknown if the MME does not support T-ADS Data Retrieval or did not successfully answer to the T-ADS request from the HSS, even if the Gn/Gp-SGSN indicated IMS Voice over PS Sessions is supported.\n-\tIf the serving node answers successfully to the T-ADS data request, but it does not include any of the T-ADS Information Elements (IMS Voice over PS Sessions Supported, Access Type, RAT Type and Last UE Activity Time), the HSS shall indicate IMS Voice over PS Sessions support is not supported, unless the subscriber is attached in another node that indicates support (if applicable).\n-\tIf at least one serving node provided T-ADS data to the HSS, the HSS may also provide the received last UE activity time which should include a specific timezone, Access Type and RAT type. If all serving nodes successfully answer to the T-ADS request from the HSS, the HSS shall provide the most recent IMS Voice over PS Sessions support indication as indicated by the serving nodes.\nNOTE 5:\tThe last UE activity time without a specific timezone can result in IMS receiving unexpected time if timezone is not included, especially for roaming to PLMN with different timezone.\n4b.\tIf CSRN is requested but roaming number retrieval from the MSC/VLR fails, the HSS shall include an empty CSRN element in the xml document returned to the AS. In addition, if MTRR is applicable (see 3GPP TS 23.018 [10]), the HSS shall set an MTRR-Indication in the xml document. See 3GPP TS 23.292 [33].\n5.\tThe HSS shall include the data pertinent to the requested Data Reference in the User-Data AVP. The HSS shall set the Result-Code to DIAMETER_SUCCESS. This includes cases where the data is not available to the HSS. The pertinent data included shall refer to the received IMPU/MSISDN/External Identifier and Private Identity (if present).\nNOTE 6:\tData referred to a Private Identity (e.g. IMS Private User Identity) implies that only the data (e.g. Location Information) specific for that Private Identity is included, regardless of the type of User Identity received (e.g. IMS Public User Identity shared by multiple IMS Private User Identities).\nIf both the AS and the HSS have determined via mutual feature evaluation to not support the Notif-Eff feature and in the case that requested data is not available to the HSS, the HSS shall not include the User-Data AVP in the Sh-Pull Response.\nIf both the AS and the HSS support the Notif-Eff feature, the HSS shall include the data pertinent to all the requested Data References, Service Indications and Identity Sets in the User-Data AVP. The following applies:\n-\tIf none of the requested data is available to the HSS, the HSS shall not include the User-Data AVP in the Sh-Pull Response.\n-\tIf some of the requested data is not available to the HSS, it shall be indicated as follows:\n-\tEmpty repository data shall be indicated with the RepositoryData element that contains a Service Indication and a Sequence Number but does not contain a ServiceData element (i.e. ServiceData is not present).\n-\tUnavailable Public Identifiers shall be indicated with an empty PublicIdentifiers element.\n-\tUnavailable location information shall be indicated by an empty CSLocationInformation and/or an empty PSLocationInformation element and/or an empty EPSLocationInformation element and/or an empty TWANLocationInformation and/or and empty Sh-5GSLocationInformation.\n-\tUnavailable CS-UserState shall be indicated by a missing CSUserState element.\n-\tUnavailable PS-UserState shall be indicated by a missing PSUserState element.\n-\tUnavailable EPS-UserState shall be indicated by a missing EPSUserState element.\n-\tUnavailable elements of Sh IMS Data shall be indicated as follows:\n-\tAn unavailable S-CSCF name shall be indicated with empty SCSCFName element.\n-\tAn unavailable IP Address Secure Binding Information shall be indicated with empty IPv4address element or empty IPv6prefix element.\n-\tIf all iFCs for the user that are relevant for the AS are unavailable it shall be indicated with empty IFCs element.\n-\tNot available UE SRVCC capability shall be indicated with missing UE-SRVCC-Capability element.\n-\tNot available UE 5G SRVCC capability shall be indicated with missing UE-5G-SRVCC-Capability element.\n-\tNot available STN-SR shall be indicated with empty STN-SR element.\nNOTE 7:\tIf the HSS supports interworking with UDM, the HSS can also take into account the availability of the STN-SR from the UDM as described in 3GPP TS 23.632 [48].\n-\tNot available CSRN shall be indicated with empty CSRN element.\n-\tNot available IMSI shall be indicated with empty IMSI element.\nNOTE 8:\tIf there is no available STN-SR in the HSS, it indicates that the user is not SRVCC subscribed and if there is no available STN-SR from the UDM, it indicates that the user is not 5G-SRVCC subscribed, as described in 3GPP TS 23.008 [27] and 3GPP TS 23.632 [48].\nIf there is an error in any of the above steps, then the HSS shall stop processing and shall return the error code specified in the respective step (see 3GPP TS 29.329 [5] and 3GPP TS 29.229 [7] for an explanation of the error codes).\nIf the HSS cannot fulfil the received request for reasons not stated in the above steps, e.g. due to a database error or empty mandatory data elements, it shall stop processing the request and set Result-Code to DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_COMPLY.\nOtherwise, the requested operation shall take place and the HSS shall return the Result-Code AVP set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS. Result-Code DIAMETER_SUCCESS is used also if the requested data does not exist in the HSS i.e. when the HSS is indicating valid empty data elements.",

      "content": "Within the Sh-Update Request, the keys to determine the updated data are part of the information element Data (See 7.6). When data in the repository is updated (i.e. added, modified or removed) Service-Indication and Sequence-Number are also sent as part of the information element Data.\nNewly added transparent data shall be associated with a Sequence Number of 0 in the Sh-Update Request. Sequence Number value 0 is reserved exclusively for indication of newly added transparent data.Modified and removed transparent data shall be associated within the Sh-Update Request with a Sequence Number of n+1 where n is the original Sequence Number associated with the transparent data before modification or removal. If n equals 65535, then the next modification or deletion of that transparent data shall be associated with a Sequence Number of 1.\nUpon reception of the Sh-Update request, the HSS shall, in the following order:\n1.\tIn the AS permission list (see clause 6.2) check that the data that is requested to be updated (Sh-Update) by this AS, is allowed to be updated by checking the combination of the identity of the AS sending the request (identified by the Origin-Host AVP) and the supplied Data-Reference.\n-\tIf the data is not allowed to be updated, Experimental-Result shall be set to DIAMETER_ERROR_USER_DATA_CANNOT_BE_MODIFIED in the Sh-Update Response.\n2.\tCheck that the User Identity in the request exists in the HSS. If not, Experimental-Result shall be set to DIAMETER_ERROR_USER_UNKNOWN in the Sh-Update Response.\n2a.\tCheck if the Private User Identity (if received) corresponds to the IMPU/MSISDN/External Identifier received in User-Identity. If not, Experimental-Result-Code shall be set to DIAMETER_ERROR_IDENTITIES_DONT_MATCH.\n3.\tIf the type of the User Identity (i.e. IMS Public User Identity or Public Service Identity or MSISDN or External Identifier) does not apply according to Table 7.6.1 as access key for the Data-Reference (if Update-Eff-Enhance is in use: for all the Data-References) indicated in the request, Experimental-Result shall be set to DIAMETER_ERROR_OPERATION_NOT_ALLOWED in the Sh-Update Response.\n4.\tIf Data-Reference is PSIActivation (18), then the HSS shall check that the User Identity contains a distinct Public Service Identity. If it does, then the HSS shall update the corresponding PSI Activation State and return the Result-Code AVP set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS. If it does not, then the Experimental-Result shall be set to DIAMETER_ERROR_OPERATION_NOT_ALLOWED in the Sh-Update Response.\nThe change of a Public Service Identity from ACTIVE to INACTIVE shall trigger the network initiated deregistration of the Public Service Identity in the HSS.\n4a.\tIf Data-Reference is DSAI (19), check whether or not, for the Public Identity, there is an instance of DSAI matching the DSAI-Tag contained in the Sh-Update command. If so, then the HSS shall update the DSAI value and return the Result-Code AVP set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS. If not, Experimental-Result shall be set to DIAMETER_ERROR_DSAI_NOT_AVAILABLE.\nThe changes of DSAI value shall trigger the procedures described in clause 7.14 in order to determine which initial filter criteria should be masked or unmasked. If these procedures change the set of unmasked initial filter criteria, the HSS should behave as if the initial filter criteria had been administratively changed, which implies e.g. sending Sh-Notif or Cx-Update_Subscr_Data messages (see 3GPP TS 29.228 [6]).\n4b.\tIf Data-Reference is SMSRegistrationInfo (24), check whether or not, for the IMS Public User Identity or MSISDN or External Identifier, IP-SM-GW number element contained in the Sh-Update command is empty. If it is empty, then the HSS shall delete the stored registered IP-SM-GW number (if any) and the stored registered IP-SM-GW Diameter Identity (if any), and return the Result-Code AVP set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS. A preconfigured IP-SM-GW number and preconfigured IP-SM-GW Diameter Identity shall not be deleted.\nIf it is not empty, the HSS shall store/update the registered IP-SM-GW number and, if S6c is supported, the IP-SM-GW Diameter Identity as received within the Origin-Host and Origin-Realm AVPs, and return the Result-Code AVP set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS. A preconfigured IP-SM-GW number and preconfigured IP-SM-GW Diameter Identity shall not be overwritten.\nThe Service Centre Address in the HSS shall not be updated by this operation.\nNOTE 1:\tThe address of the Short Message Service Centre as defined in 7.6.16 is only applicable to Sh-Pull operation.\n4c.\tIf the Data-Reference indicates that repository data is present, and if the HSS and the AS supports the Update-Eff feature, check whether there are multiple repository data instances. If so, then repeat the steps 5 and 6 below for each instance of repository data ensuring that no repository data is changed until the checks done in the steps 5 and 6 have been successful for all the repository data instances.\n4d.\tIf the Data-Reference is STN-SR (27) and if the STN-SR is different from the one previously stored or provisioned in the HSS, the HSS shall overwrite the STN-SR. If the Data-Reference is STN-SR (27), the HSS supports interworking with the UDM (see in 3GPP TS 23.632 [48]), and if the STN-SR is different from the one previously stored or provisioned in the UDM, the UDM shall overwrite the STN-SR. If the Data-Reference is STN-SR (27), and if there is no stored STN-SR in the HSS and there is no stored STN-SR in the UDM, Experimental-Result shall be set to DIAMETER_ERROR_OPERATION_NOT_ALLOWED in the Sh-Update Response.\nNOTE 2:\tIf there is no stored STN-SR in the HSS, it indicates that the user is not SRVCC subscribed and if there is no stored STN-SR in the UDM, it indicates that the user is not 5G-SRVCC subscribed, as described in 3GPP TS 23.008 [27].\n5.\tCheck whether or not the data that is requested to be updated by the AS, as identified by the Service-Indication, is currently being updated by another entity. If there is an update of the data in progress, Experimental-Result shall be set to DIAMETER_PRIOR_UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS in the Sh-Update Response.\n6.\tCheck whether or not there is any repository data stored at the HSS already for the specified Service-Indication and the associated IMS Public User Identity (or group if the IMS Public User Identity is alias) or Public Service Identity.\n-\tIf repository data identified by the Service-Indication is stored at the HSS for the specified IMS Public User Identity, IMS Public User Identity group or Public Service Identity, check the following premises:\n1.\tSequence_Number_in_Sh_Update is not equal to 0\n2.\t(Sequence_Number_in_Sh_Update - 1) is equal to (Sequence_Number_In_HSS modulo 65535)\n-\tIf either of the above premises is false then Experimental-Result shall be set to DIAMETER_ERROR_TRANSPARENT_DATA_OUT_OF_SYNC in the Sh-Update Response.\n-\tIf both of the above premises are true, then check whether or not Service Data is received within the Sh-Update Req.\n-\tIf Service Data element is present in the Sh-Update Req, check whether or not the size of the data is greater than that which the HSS is prepared to accept.\n-\tIf there is more data than the HSS is prepared to accept then Experimental-Result shall be set to DIAMETER_ERROR_TOO_MUCH_DATA and the new data shall be discarded.\n-\tIf the HSS is prepared to accept the data, then the repository data stored at the HSS shall be updated with the repository data sent in the Sh-Update Req and the Sequence Number associated with that repository data shall be updated with that sent in the Sh-Update Req. This triggers the sending of Sh-Notif messages to any other ASs that are subscribed to Notifications for updates to the service data for that IMS Public User Identity or Public Service Identity. This also triggers the sending of Sh-Notif messages for an alias of that IMS Public User Identity to any AS that is subscribed to Notifications for updates to the service data for that alias of the received IMS Public User Identity (see clause 6.1.4).\n-\tIf Service Data element is not present in the Sh-Update Req, the data stored in the repository at the HSS shall be removed, and as a consequence the Service Indication and the Sequence Number associated with the removed data shall also be removed. This triggers the sending of Sh-Notif messages with that Service Indication and Sequence Number to be deleted but with an absent Service Data element, to any other ASs that are subscribed to Notifications for updates to the service data for that IMS Public User Identity or Public Service identity (see 6.1.4). After sending Sh-Notif messages, the subscriptions to Notifications for the removed Repository Data shall be deleted.\n-\tIf repository data identified by the Service-Indication is not stored for the IMS Public User Identity, IMS Public User Identity group or Public Service Identity i.e. the Sh-Update Req intends to create a new repository data, check whether or not the Sequence Number in the Sh-Update Req is 0.\n-\tIf the sequence number is not set to 0, Experimental-Result shall be set to DIAMETER_ERROR_TRANSPARENT_DATA_OUT_OF_SYNC\n-\tIf the sequence number is set to 0 check whether Service Data is included within the Sh-Update Req.\n-\tIf Service Data is not present in the Sh-Update Req, then Experimental-Result shall be set to DIAMETER_ERROR_OPERATION_NOT_ALLOWED and the operation shall be ignored by the HSS.\n-\tIf Service Data element is present in the Sh-Update Req, check whether or not the size of the data is greater than that which the HSS is prepared to accept.\n-\tIf there is more data than the HSS is prepared to accept then Experimental‑Result shall be set to DIAMETER_ERROR_TOO_MUCH_DATA and the new data shall be discarded.\n-\tIf the HSS is prepared to accept the data included in the Sh-Update Req, then the data shall be stored in the data repository in the HSS.\nIf the HSS receives a request to update data other than Repository Data while a previous update request of the same data for the same user identity is still in progress, the HSS should stop processing the later request and set the Experimental-Result-Code to DIAMETER_PRIOR_UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS.\nNOTE 3:\tIf the HSS receives a request to update data other than Repository Data while a previous update request of the same data for the same user identity is still in progress, it identifies either an AS or network misbehavior. If the HSS processed those requests it could cause a network unexpected behaviour.\nIf there is an error in any of the above steps then the HSS shall stop processing and shall return the error code specified in the respective step (see 3GPP TS 29.329 [5] and 3GPP TS 29.229 [7] for an explanation of the error codes).\nIf the HSS cannot fulfil the received request for reasons not stated in the above steps, e.g. due to database error, it shall stop processing the request and set Result-Code to DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_COMPLY.\nIf the HSS and the AS support the Update-Eff feature, the Sh Update is successful only if it is successful for the update of all the repository data instances in the request. Otherwise the HSS shall keep or restore all the stored repository data as they were before receiving the Sh Update request. If the error occurs during the steps 5 or 6 and if there were several repository data instances in the request, the Sh Update response shall contain a Repository Data ID indicating the service indication and the sequence number of (one of) the repository data instance(s) for which an error occurred.\nIf the HSS and the AS support the Update-Eff-Enhance feature, the Sh Update is successful only if it is successful for the update of all the data instances in the request. Otherwise the HSS shall keep or restore all the stored data as they were before receiving the Sh Update request. If an error occurs during the steps 5 or 6 with any of the data instance in the request, the Sh Update response shall contain the corresponding Data Reference indicating the first data instance for which an error occurred. If there were several repository data instances in the request, the HSS shall behave the same as specified for Update-Eff feature.\nOtherwise, the requested operation shall take place and the HSS shall return the Result-Code AVP set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS.\nNOTE 4:\tWhen an AS receives DIAMETER_ERROR_TRANSPARENT_DATA_OUT_OF_SYNC the AS may attempt to resolve the inconsistency between the version of the repository data that it holds and that stored at the HSS. It may execute a Sh-Pull to retrieve the current version of the data from the HSS or it may wait to receive a subsequent Sh-Notif message from the HSS for the affected repository data.",

If notifications on changes of repository data are requested, Service-Indication shall be present in the request. If notifications on changes of filter criteria are requested, the Server-Name AVP shall be used as key to the filter criteria. If the request contains a specific Public Service Identity matching a Wildcarded PSI, the HSS shall interpret that the subscription refers to the information associated to the Wildcarded PSI. The Server-Name AVP shall contain the SIP URL of the AS sending the request. If notifications on changes of DSAI are requested, the DSAI-Tag AVP shall be used as key of the DSAI whose changes are to be monitored.\nUpon reception of the Sh-Subs-Notif request, the HSS shall, in the following order (if there is an error in any of the following steps the HSS shall stop processing and return the corresponding error code, see 3GPP TS 29.329 [5] and 3GPP TS 29.229 [7]), process the hereafter steps that, unless otherwise stated, apply both for the Subscription request type information element indicating the request is to subscribe or to unsubscribe:\n1.\tIn the AS permission list (see clause 6.2) the HSS shall check that the AS is allowed to subscribe to notifications (Sh-Subs-Notif) for the requested data by checking the combination of the identity of the AS sending the request (identified by the Origin-Host AVP) and the supplied Data-Reference.\n-\tIf this AS does not have Sh-Subs-Notif permission for the data referenced, Experimental-Result shall be set to DIAMETER_ERROR_USER_DATA_CANNOT_BE_NOTIFIED in the Sh-Subs-Notif Response.\n2.\tThe HSS shall check that the User Identity in the request exists in HSS.

If the HSS receives a Sh-Subs-Notif Request without the Expiry Time IE, the HSS should treat it as a request for an unlimited subscription.\nIf the HSS does not include this IE in the response, that indicates an unlimited subscription.\nIf a subsequent request is received by the HSS where the Expiry Time IE is present but different from what the HSS has previously stored, the HSS should replace the stored expiration time with what was received in the request.\n5.\tIf Data-Reference is RepositoryData(0) and the transparent data associated with the Service Indication does not exist in the HSS (i.e. Service Data is not present), then Experimental-Result shall be set to DIAMETER_ERROR_SUBS_DATA_ABSENT.\n6.\tIf the Subscription request type information element indicates that this is a request to subscribe, the HSS shall associate the Application Server Identity with the list of entities that need to be notified when the data identified by the request is modified and set the Result-Code to DIAMETER_SUCCESS in the Sh-Subs-Notify response.

This is, from the Application Server's perspective, just an indication, and an Application Server must be prepared to be involved in sessions even if the trigger that caused its involvement has been masked by that Application Server.\nThis information element contains the activation state of a Service (identified by its DSAI-tag, see clause 7.14, for a specific user identified by a Public User Identity or of a Service identified by its PSI).

In that case, there is a set of identities matching a specific wildcarded PSI and all the identities in the set share the same DSAIs. Any change in these DSAIs masked from a single identity of the set will apply to all the identities associated to that wildcarded PSI.\nEach DSAI is implicitly bound to a list of (at least one) initial filter criteria. The binding is not exclusive, i.e. one instance of initial filter criteria may be bound to zero or more DSAIs, however all the iFCs bound to a given DSAI should trigger to the same AS (i.e. they should share the same ServerName), which is the only one allowed to update it.\nAn instance of initial filter criteria shall be included into the Service-Profile sent through the Cx Interface according to the operations described in 3GPP TS 29.228 [6] if at least one of the following conditions applies:\n-\tNo DSAI is bound to those initial filter criteria;\n-\tAt least one of the DSAIs bound to those initial filter criteria is set to ACTIVE.",

The operator provisions the service in an AS. The AS stores some service data for a user in the HSS, Sh-Update (user identity, updated data) e.g. repository data.\n2.\tHSS confirms the data is updated\n3.\tSome time later, user registers with the network\n4.\tS-CSCF downloads the data from the HSS (during the procedure S-CSCF Registration Notification on Cx interface). Filter criteria specify that the AS wants to be notified that the end user is registered.\n5.\t200 OK\n6.\tS-CSCF sends third party registration message to the application server to notify that user is registered.\n7.\t200 OK\n8.\tThe AS subscribes to notifications and downloads data needed for providing service from HSS, by means of Sh-Subs-Notif (user identity, requested data, service information and send data indication).\n9.\tHSS confirms the subscription request and sends data to AS\n10.\tAt some moment, the AS decides to update user's service data e.g. repository data in the HSS, by means of Sh-Update (user identity, updated data).\n11.\tThe HSS confirms the service data is updated.\n12.\tAt some moment, user data is updated in the HSS. As the AS subscribed to notifications (step 8), the HSS sends to the AS the requested updates, by means of Sh-Notif (user identity, updated data).\n13.\tThe AS acknowledges the notification.\nAnnex C (informative):UML model of the data downloaded over Sh interface\nThe purpose of this UML model is to define in an abstract level the structure of the data downloaded over the Sh interface and describe the purpose of the different information classes included in it.\nC.1\tGeneral description\nThe following picture gives an outline of the UML model of the user profile, which is exchanged between the HSS and an AS:\nFigure C.1.1: Sh-Data\nClass Sh-Data contains the following attributes:\n-\tAn optional instance of CSUserState attribute.\n-\tAn optional instance of PSUserState attribute.\n-\tAn optional instance of IMSI attribute.\n-\tZero or more instances of IMSPrivateUserIdentity attribute.\n-\tAn optional instance of IMEISV attribute.\nClass Sh-Data contains the following classes:\n-\tAn optional instance of the class PublicIdentifiers.\n-\tZero or moreinstances of the class RepositoryData.\n-\tAn optional instance of the class Sh-IMS-Data.\n-\tAn optional instance of the class CSLocationInformation.\n-\tAn optional instance of the class PSLocationInformation.\n-\tAn optional instance of the class RegisteredIdentities.\n-\tAn optional instance of the class ImplicitIdentities.\n-\tAn optional instance of the class AllIdentities.\n-\tAn optional instance of the class AliasIdentities.\n-\tAn optional instance of the class DeletedIdentities.\nIf the AS and the HSS both support the Notif-Eff feature and the AS requires to read more than one Identity Sets of a Public Identity, or regardless whether or not the Notif-Eff feature is supported, the AS has subscribed to be notifed of changes to IMSPublicIdentity for more than one Identity Sets (see table 7.6.1), the class PublicIdentifiers shall not be used to convey IMS Public Identities (it shall however still be used to convey the MSISDNs if so requested). Instead the classes RegisteredIdentities, ImplicitIdentities, AllIdentities and AliasIdentities shall be used and they contain the REGISTERED_IDENTITIES, IMPLICIT_IDENTITIES, ALL_IDENTITIES and ALIAS_IDENTITIES associated with the IMS Public Identity included in the request respectively. See clause 7.6.2 for the detailed information. The class PublicIdentifiers or the one among the four which may be used to contain the corresponding identity set can both be used to convey IMS Public Identities when AS requires only one identity set of a public identity.\nIf Public Identity(ies) are deleted and the AS has any subscription active for the deleted identity(ies), the HSS shall notify the AS of the deletion of the identity(ies) using the class DeletedIdentities.\nClass RepositoryData contains repository data (transparent data) for a given service that are associated to a Public user Identity or a group of alias Public User Identities.

See clause 6.1.1 and 6.1.3.\n-\tAn optional instance of WilcardedIMPU attribute, if the Public User Identity in the request matches a Wildcarded IMPU.\nNOTE:\tThis attribute can be omitted if this information is conveyed including Wildcarded Public User Identity information element in the response. See clause 6.1.1 and 6.1.3.\n-\tZero or more instances of MSISDN attribute, that contains an MSISDN.\nClass PublicIdentifiers contains the following classes:\n-\tZero to more instances of EnhancedIMSPublicIdentifiers. This class is required when more than one instance of IMSPublicIdentity shall be returned and the identities are of different types. See clause 7.6.2 for more information about contents. It includes the following attributes:\n-\tOne instance of IMSPublicIdentity attribute that contains a Public Identity.\n-\tOne instance of the IdentityType attribute that identifies the identity type in the IMSPublicIdentity attribute, it could be either:\n-\tA distinct Public User Identity\n-\tA distinct Public Service Identity\n-\tA Wildcarded Public Service Identity\n-\tA Wildcarded Public User Identity\n-\tZero or more instances of ExtendedMSISDN, only when Additional-MSISDN feature is enabled. It includes the following attributes:\n-\tOne instance of MSISDN attribute that contains an MSISDN.\n-\tOne instance of MSISDNType attribute that indicates the MSISDN Type.\nFigure C.2.2: Void\nC.3\tSh-IMS-Data\nThe following picture details the UML model of the class Sh-IMS-Data.\nFigure C.3.1: Sh-IMS-Data\nEach instance of the class Sh-IMS-Data contains 0 or 1 instance of the class S-CSCFName, 0 to 1 instance of the class IFCs, 0 or 1 instance of the class IMSUserState, 0 or 1 instance of the class ChargingInformation, 0 or 1 instance of the class PSIActivation, 0 to n instances of the class DSAI, 0 or 1 instance of the class ServiceLevelTraceInfo, 0 or 1 instance of the class IPAddressSecureBindingInformation, and 0 or 1 instance of the class ReferenceLocationInformation.\nClass S-CSCFName contains a SIP URI.

receives more than one instance of ReferenceLocationInformation it may arbitrarily pick one for further processing.\nAnnex E (informative):T-ADS request handling in the HSS\nE.1\tT-ADS request handling in the HSSThe following figure shows a possible detailed handling of T-ADS Information request in the HSS:\nWhen receiving a T-ADS request from an Application Server, the HSS checks whether serving nodes (i.e. SGSN and/or MME) are registered (i.e. GPRS services and/or EPS services are actually subscribed, serving node addresses are stored and not marked as purged).\nIf neither MME nor SGSN is registered, a response indicating that IMS voice over PS sessions is not supported is returned to the Application Server. UE Activity Time and the Last RAT Type are not reported.\nIf both MME and SGSN are registered but the registered SGSN is a Gn/Gp-SGSN, the HSS treats the MME as not registered in the following T-ADS request handling.\nOtherwise,\nif in the previous ULR(s) the AVP Homogeneous-Support-of-IMS-Voice-Over-PS-Sessions was received from all the registered serving nodes with the same value (either with SUPPORTED or NOT_SUPPORTED), a response with the received value is returned to the Application Server. UE Activity Time and the Last RAT Type are not reported.\nif in previous ULRs the AVP Homogeneous-Support-of-IMS-Voice-Over-PS-Sessions was received from all the registered serving nodes but with different values, the HSS continues processing as follows:\nif MME or SGSN (or both) did not indicated support of T-ADS Data Retrieval within the previous ULR, a response indicating IMS-VOICE-OVER-PS-SUPPORT-UNKNOWN is returned to the Application Server. UE Activity Time and the Last RAT Type are not reported.\notherwise the HSS retrieves T-ADS Data from MME and from SGSN. After retrieval, the HSS returns a response to the Application Server indicating the response from MME or SGSN whichever reported the most recent UE Activity Time. UE Activity Time and the Last RAT Type are also reported.\nif in the previous ULR(s) the AVP Homogeneous-Support-of-IMS-Voice-Over-PS-Sessions was not received from at least one of the registered serving nodes, the HSS continues processing as follows:\nif at least one of the registered serving nodes that did not send an Homogeneous-Support-of-IMS-Voice-Over-PS-Sessions AVP within the previous ULR did not indicate support of T-ADS Data Retrieval within the previous ULR, a response indicating IMS-VOICE-OVER-PS-SUPPORT-UNKNOWN is returned to the Application Server. UE Activity Time and the Last RAT Type are not reported.\notherwise the HSS retrieves T-ADS Data from all the registered serving nodes that did not send an Homogeneous-Support-of-IMS-Voice-Over-PS-Sessions AVP within the previous ULR. When all responses are received the HSS continues processing as follows:\nif two T-ADS Data responses were receive (one from MME and one from SGSN), the HSS returns a response to the Application Server indicating the response from MME or SGSN whichever reported the most recent UE Activity Time. UE Activity Time and the Last RAT Type are also reported.\nif one T-ADS Data response was received (from MME or SGSN) and the other serving node (SGSN or MME) was not registered, the HSS returns a response to the Application Server indicating the response from responding serving node. UE Activity Time and the Last RAT Type are also reported.\nif one T-ADS Data response was received (from MME or SGSN) and the other serving node (SGSN or MME) has sent an Homogeneous-Support-of-IMS-Voice-Over-PS-Sessions AVP within the previous ULR, the HSS continues processing as follows:\nif information about support / non-support of IMS voice over PS sessions from both serving nodes are identical, the HSS returns this information to the Application Server. UE Activity Time and the Last RAT Type are not reported.\nif information about support / non-support of IMS voice over PS sessions from both serving nodes are not identical, the HSS continues processing as follows:\nif the serving node that sent an Homogeneous-Support-of-IMS-Voice-Over-PS-Sessions AVP within the previous ULR did not indicate support of T-ADS Data Retrieval within the previous ULR, a response indicating IMS-VOICE-OVER-PS-SUPPORT-UNKNOWN is returned to the Application Server. UE Activity Time and the Last RAT Type are not reported.\notherwise the HSS retrieves T-ADS Data from the serving node that sent an Homogeneous-Support-of-IMS-Voice-Over-PS-Sessions AVP within the previous ULR. When the response is received, the HSS returns a response to the Application Server indicating the response from MME or SGSN whichever reported the most recent UE Activity Time. UE Activity Time and the Last RAT Type are also reported.\nAnnex F (normative):Diameter overload control mechanism\nF.1\tGeneral\nDiameter overload control mechanism is an optional feature.\nIETF RFC 7683 [36] specifies a Diameter overload control mechanism which includes the definition and the transfer of related AVPs between Diameter nodes.\nIt is recommended to make use of IETF RFC 7683 [36] on the Sh interface where, when applied, the AS shall behave as a reacting node and the HSS as a reporting node.\nDepending on regional/national requirements and network operator policy, priority traffic (e.g. MPS as described in 3GPP TS 22.153 [38]) shall be exempted from throttling due to Diameter overload control up to the point where requested traffic reduction cannot be achieved without throttling the priority traffic.\nF.2\tHSS behaviour\nThe HSS requests traffic reduction from the AS when the HSS is in an overload situation, including OC-OLR AVP in answer commands as described in IETF RFC 7683 [36].\nThe HSS identifies that it is in an overload situation by implementation specific means. For example, the HSS may take into account the traffic over the Sh interfaces or other interfaces, the level of usage of internal resources (CPU, memory), the access to external resources, etc.\nThe HSS determines the specific contents of OC-OLR AVP in overload reports and the HSS decides when to send OC-OLR AVPs by implementation specific means.\nF.3\tAS behaviour\nThe AS applies required traffic reduction received in answer commands to subsequent applicable requests, as per IETF RFC 7683 [36].\nThe AS achieves requested traffic reduction by implementation specific means. For example, the AS may implement message throttling with prioritization or a message retaining mechanism for operations that can be postponed.\nDiameter requests related to priority traffic (e.g. MPS) and emergency, detected via the presence of priority information (e.g., Resource-Priority header field for MPS) in SIP messages as described in 3GPP TS 24.229 [39], have the highest priority. Depending on regional/national regulatory and operator policies, these Diameter requests shall be the last to be throttled, when the AS has to apply traffic reduction. Relative priority amongst various priority traffic (e.g. MPS) and emergency traffic is subject to regional/national regulatory and operator policies.\nAnnex G (Informative):Diameter overload node behaviour\nG.1\tMessage prioritization\nThis clause describes possible behaviours of the AS regarding message prioritization in an informative purpose.\nThe AS may take the following into account when making throttling decisions:\n-\tIdentification of the procedures that can be deferred (e.g. Subscription to notification of Data Update), so to avoid to drop non deferrable procedures;\n-\tPrioritization of certain types of request (e.g. between PUR and SNR) according to the context of their use, in particular:\n-\tHigher prioritization of commands for AS that are related to a registered user for a service, so to avoid the interruption of the registered service for the user.\n-\tLower prioritization of commands for AS that are related to massive subscription data update due to provisioning.\n-\tPriority level of a priority user (e.g., MPS user).\nAnnex H (Informative):Data shared among multiple subscribers\nH.1\tGeneral\nThis clause applies only to Repository Data.\nAs defined by this specification, Repository Data is updated using a Sh-Update procedure per subscriber and Service Indication. This means that when Repository Data needs to be modified, it requires an update operation per subscriber, even if the same Repository Data is also part of other subscribers' data set.\nIf Repository Data for a specific Service Indication is shared by a large amount of subscribers, it implies a large amount of update operations, which may trigger a large amount of notifications if any AS subscribed to changes for these corresponding subscribers.\nSee 3GPP TS 29.364 [40] for a description of a solution to avoid this massive amount of update operations. However, it is important to remark that there may be other implementation specific solutions that handle data sharing among multiple individual subscribers.\nAnnex I (normative):Diameter message priority mechanism\nI.1\tGeneral\nIETF RFC 7944 [42] specifies a Diameter message priority mechanism that allows Diameter nodes to indicate the relative priority of Diameter messages. With this information, other Diameter nodes may leverage the relative priority of Diameter messages into routing, resource allocation, set the DSCP marking for transport of the associated Diameter message, and also abatement decisions when overload control is applied.\nI.2\tSh/Dh interface\nI.2.1\tGeneral\nThe Diameter message priority mechanism is an optional feature.\nIt is recommended to make use of IETF RFC 7944 [42] over the Sh/Dh interface of an operator network when the overload control defined in Annex F is applied on this Sh/Dh interface.\nI.2.2\tAS/OSA SCS behaviour\nWhen the AS/OSA SCS supports the Diameter message priority mechanism, the AS/OSA SCS shall comply with IETF RFC 7944 [42].\nThe AS/OSA SCS sending a request shall determine the required priority according to its policies. When priority is required, the AS/OSA SCS shall include the DRMP AVP indicating the required priority level in the request it sends, and shall prioritise the request according to priority level received.\nWhen the AS/OSA SCS receives the corresponding response, it shall prioritise the received response according to the priority level received within the DRMP AVP if present in the response, otherwise according to the priority level of the corresponding request.\nWhen the AS/OSA SCS receives a request, it shall handle the request according to the received DRMP AVP priority level. For the response, it may modify the priority level received in the DRMP AVP according to its policies and shall handle the response according to the required priority level. If the required priority level is different from the priority level received in the request, it shall include the DRMP AVP in the response.\nIf:\n-\tthe AS/OSA SCS supports using the Diameter message priority mechanism for DSCP marking purposes,\n-\tthe transport network utilizes DSCP marking, and\n-\tmessage-dependant DSCP marking is possible for the protocol stack transporting Diameter,\nthen the AS/OSA SCS shall set the DSCP marking for transport of the request or response according to the required priority level.\nDiameter requests related to priority traffic (e.g. MPS as identified by the AS through SIP procedures, emergency) shall contain a DRMP AVP with a high priority of which the level value is operator dependent.\nWhen not-explicitly requested, the inclusion and priority value of the DRMP AVP in Diameter messages are implementation specific.\nI.2.3\tHSS/SLF behaviour\nWhen the HSS/SLF supports the Diameter message priority mechanism, the HSS/SLF shall comply with IETF RFC 7944 [42].\nThe HSS/SLF sending a request shall determine the required priority according to its policies. When priority is required, the HSS/SLF shall include the DRMP AVP indicating the required priority level in the request it sends, and shall prioritise the request according to the required priority level.\nWhen the HSS/SLF receives the corresponding response, it shall prioritise the received response according to the priority level received within the DRMP AVP if present in the response, otherwise according to the priority level of the corresponding request.\nWhen the HSS/SLF receives a request, it shall handle the request according to the received DRMP AVP priority level. For the response, it may modify the priority level received in the DRMP AVP according to its policies and shall handle the response according to the required priority level. If the required priority level is different from the priority level received in the request, it shall include the DRMP AVP in the response.\nIf:\n-\tthe HSS/SLF supports using the Diameter message priority mechanism for DSCP marking purposes,\n-\tthe transport network utilizes DSCP marking, and\n-\tmessage-dependant DSCP marking is possible for the protocol stack transporting Diameter,\nthen the HSS/SLF shall set the DSCP marking for transport of the request or response according to the required priority level.\nWhen not-explicitly requested, the inclusion and priority value of the DRMP AVP in Diameter messages are implementation specific.\nI.2.4\tInteractions\nIf the HSS/SLF supporting the Diameter message priority mechanism receives the request message containing both the Session-Priority AVP and DRMP AVP, the HSS/SLF shall prioritize the request according to priority level received within the DRMP AVP.\nAnnex J (normative):Diameter load control mechanism\nJ.1\tGeneral\nDiameter load control mechanism is an optional feature.\nIt is recommended to make use of IETF RFC 8583 [43] on the Sh interface where, when applied, the AS shall behave as reacting nodes and the HSS as a reporting node.\nJ.2\tHSS behaviour\nThe HSS may report its current load by including a Load AVP of type HOST in answer commands as described in IETF RFC 8583 [43].\nThe HSS calculates its current load by implementation specific means. For example, the HSS may take into account the traffic over the Sh interface or other interfaces, the level of usage of internal resources (e.g. CPU, memory), the access to external resources, etc.\nThe HSS determines when to send Load AVPs of type HOST by implementation specific means.\nJ.3\tAS behaviour\nWhen performing next hop Diameter Agent selection for requests that are routed based on realm, the AS may take into account load values from Load AVPs of type PEER received from candidate next hop Diameter nodes, as per IETF RFC 8583 [43].\nAnnex K (informative):Change
