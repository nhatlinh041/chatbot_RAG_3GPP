This implies that some IP flows of one PDN connection can be routed via one access system while simultaneously some IP flows of the same PDN connection can be routed via another access system.\nTo achieve IP flow mobility the inter-system mobility signalling is enhanced in order to carry routing filters.

      "content": "When a UE configures different IP addresses on multiple accesses, it can register these addresses with the HA as CoAs using multiple bindings as specified in IETF RFC 5648 [7].\nTo register multiple bindings, the UE generates a Binding ID (BID) for each CoA and stores the BID in the binding update list. The UE then registers its CoAs by sending a Binding Update (BU) with a Binding Identifier mobility option. The BID is included in the Binding Identifier mobility option. When the UE is on the home link in one of the access, the CoA field is set to the HoA in the respective BID.\nWhen the HA receives the BU with a Binding Identifier mobility option, it copies the BID from the mobility option to the corresponding field in the Binding Cache entry. If there is an existing Binding Cache entry for the UE, and if the BID in the BU does not match the one with the existing entry, the HA creates a new Binding Cache entry for the new CoA and BID.\nBased on this extension, a typical Binding Cache in HA according to this specification in case the UE is not on the home link is shown in Table 4.3.1.2-1.\nNOTE:\tA BID is only unique for a given HoA, i.e. different mobile nodes can use the same BID value.\nTable 4.3.1.2-1: Binding Cache in HA supporting multiple CoAs registration\nHome Address\nCare-of Address\nBinding ID\nPriority\nHoA1\nCoA1\nBID1\nx\nHoA1\nCoA2\nBID2\ny\n…\n…\n…\n…\nIn order to route IP flows through a specific access, the UE needs to request to store routing filters for that access at the HA: the UE includes the Flow Identification (FID) mobility option in the BU message as defined in RFC 6089 [8]. The FID option defines a routing rule which contains a routing filter and a routing address. The routing address (either CoA or HoA) is indicated by the BID. The routing filter is included in the DSMIPv6 signalling as described in RFC 6088 [12]. The routing filters are unidirectional and can be different for uplink and downlink traffic.\nIt is assumed that between UE and the Home Agent function there is always a default routing address via which packets not matching any specific routing filter are routed. The UE provides a relative priority with each BID, where the BID with the highest priority is the default route. The UE may update the priority of a BID during IP flow mobility procedures.\nTo install/remove/move an IP flow, the UE shall create a new IP flow binding or remove/update the IP flow binding at the HA by using DSMIPv6 signalling as specified in RFC 5555 [2], RFC 5648 [7] and RFC 6089 [8].\nAn example of a typical Binding Cache in HA with routing filters is shown in Table 4.3.1.2-2. Note that a FID is only unique for a given HoA, i.e. different PDN connections can use the same FID value. Each flow binding entry contains a relative priority.\nTable 4.3.1.2-2: Binding Cache in HA supporting flow bindings\nHome Address\nRouting Address\nBinding ID\nBID Priority\nFlow ID\nFID Priority\nRouting Filter\nHoA1\nCoA1\nBID1\nx\nFID1\na\nDescription of IP flows…\nFID2\nb\nDescription of IP flows…\nHoA1\nCoA2\nBID2\ny\nFID3\n…\n…\nNOTE:\tThis clause shows only a conceptual representation of the binding cache.

The WLAN access may be considered as the UE's foreign link from DSMIPv6 perspective.\nFigure 5.3.2-1: Addition of WLAN access to the PDN connection\nThe signalling flow above shows the particular case where the UE is first connected to a 3GPP access and then it requests addition of a WLAN access.\n1.\tThe UE discovers a WLAN and connects to it and configures an IPv4 address and/or an IPv6 address/prefix according to TS 23.402 [3] or TS 23.327 [4], depending whether the WLAN access is used in the context of EPC or I-WLAN mobility architecture.\n2.\tThe UE performs HA discovery, DSMIPv6 bootstrapping and DSMIPv6 home link detection procedure according to TS 23.402 [3] unless already performed in the 3GPP access.\n3.\tThe UE sends a DSMIPv6 Binding Update (HoA, CoA, Lifetime, BID, FID, flow description) message to the HA over the WLAN access. The UE may include the requested routing rules via the FID mobility option with both the routing filters and the BID (which includes the routing address) as specified in IETF RFC 5555 [2], IETF RFC 5648 [7] and RFC 6089 [8]. The UE can include more than one routing rule by including multiple FID mobility options in the Binding Update. The DSMIPv6 Binding Update also contains an indication which indicates that the home link (3GPP access) is still connected and also the BID mobility options which identify that one binding is associated with the home address (3GPP access) and the other with the Care-of-Address from the WLAN access. The UE also indicates in the Binding Update which is the default binding where the HA should route packets not matching any FID as specified in RFC 6089 [8].\n4.\tIn case the HA function is located in the PDN GW and dynamic PCC is deployed, the PDN GW sends an IP-CAN session modification request to the PCRF.

When this procedure is completed, the PDN GW Initiated Bearer Deactivation procedure as defined in TS 23.401 [10], clause 5.4.4.1, shall be performed.\nWhen the UE is attached to I-WLAN architecture through 3GPP and WLAN accesses and a detach or PDN disconnection procedure is required, similar considerations as above apply with reference to the procedures described in TS 23.327 [4] and TS 23.060 [11].\nAnnex A (informative):Change history\nDate\nTSG #\nTSG Doc.\nCR\nRev\nSubject/Comment\nOld\nNew\n06-2010\nSP-48\nSP-100353\n-\n-\nMCC Update to version 2.0.0 for presentation to TSG SA for approval\n1.1.0\n2.0.0\n06-2010\nSP-48\n-\n-\n-\nMCC Update to version 10.0.0 after approval at TSG SA (Release 10)\n2.0.0\n10.0.0\n09-2010\nSP-49\nSP-100547\n0003\n2\nPDN GW capability check in IFOM\n10.0.0\n10.1.0\n09-2010\nSP-49\nSP-100547\n0004\n-\nInter System Routing Policies\n10.0.0\n10.1.0\n09-2010\nSP-49\nSP-100547\n0005\n-\nPDN GW imitated BID removal\n10.0.0\n10.1.0\n09-2010\nSP-49\nSP-100547\n0007\n-\nAddition of the Reference and Miscellaneous corrections\n10.0.0\n10.1.0\n03-2012\nSP-55\nSP-120071\n0011\n-\nIETF reference update for TS 23.261\n10.1.0\n10.2.0\n2012-09\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-11 version (MCC)\n10.2.0\n11.0.0\n2014-09\nSP-65\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-12 version (MCC)\n11.0.0\n12.0.0\n2015-12\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-13 version (MCC)\n12.0.0\n13.0.0\n2017-03\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-14 version (MCC)\n13.0.0\n14.0.0\n2018-06\nSP-80\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-15 version (MCC)\n14.0.0\n15.0.0\n2020-07\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-16 version (MCC)\n15.0.0\n16.0.0\n2022-03\nSP-95E\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-17 version (MCC)\n16.0.0\n17.0.0\n2024-03\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-18 version (MCC)\n17.0.0\n18.0.0",
