The MCPTT service utilizes the common functional architecture to support MC services over LTE including the common services core defined in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16].Support for both MCPTT group calls and MCPTT private calls operating in on-network and off-network modes of operation is specified.\nThe corresponding service requirements are defined in 3GPP TS 22.179 [2] and 3GPP TS 22.280 [17].\nThe present document is applicable primarily to MCPTT voice service using E-UTRAN access based on the EPC architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.401 [8]. Certain application functions of the MCPTT service such as dispatch and administrative functions could also be supported via non-3GPP access networks but no additional functionality is specified to support non-3GPP access.\nThe MCPTT service requires preferential handling compared to normal telecommunication services e.g. in support of police or fire brigade including the handling of prioritised MCPTT calls for emergency and imminent threats.\nThe MCPTT service can be used for public safety applications and also for general commercial applications e.g. utility companies and railways.\nIn the present document, MCPTT calls between MCPTT users on different MCPTT systems are considered.",

The request of resources over Rx shall include an application identifier for MCPTT in order for the PCRF to evaluate the correct QCI.\nThe UE is required to support at minimum one UM bearer which is used for MCPTT voice (see annex A in 3GPP TS 36.331 [12]).\nDepending on operator policy:\n-\tthe MCPTT system may be able to request modification of the priority (ARP) of an existing bearer without the need to initiate a new dedicated GBR bearer; or\n-\tthe EPS bearers for MCPTT call may enable pre-emption of lower priority EPS bearers if the maximum number of UM bearers has been reached in favour of MCPTT initiated EPS bearer, if the EPS bearer used for MCPTT call has higher priority level (ARP) than the UM bearer(s) used for other application(s) and if the bearers for non MCPTT application are pre-emptable.

      "content": "10.6.2.3.1.1.1\tGeneral\nA pre-arranged group call is initiated by one of the affiliated group members. The initiation of a pre-arranged group call results in all other affiliated group members being invited. Media plane resources are reserved (on-demand) or a pre-established session is associated during the group call setup procedure and released (if on-demand session) or de-associated (if pre-established session) when the call is released. SIP signalling is used to setup and release pre-arranged group calls.\n10.6.2.3.1.1.2\tPre-arranged group call setup\nThe procedure focuses on the case where an MCPTT client is initiating an MCPTT group call with unicast signalling for communicating with the affiliated MCPTT members of that group.\nProcedures in figure 10.6.2.3.1.1.2-1 are the signalling control plane procedures for the MCPTT client initiating establishment of an MCPTT group call with a pre-arranged group i.e., MCPTT users on client 1, client 2 and client 3 belong to the same group which is defined in the MCPTT group management server.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tA pre-arranged group is an MCPTT group that is pre-defined with MCPTT group ID and member list in the group management server. All members of the group belong to the same MCPTT system.\n2.\tIt is assumed that MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 are already registered for receiving MCPTT service and affiliated. Optionally, they may have an activated functional alias to be used during the group communication.\n3.\tOptionally the MCPTT server has subscribed to the MCPTT functional alias controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-activation updates.\n4.\tOptionally the MCPTT user on MCPTT client 1 has bound a functional alias to the MCPTT group ID (3GPP TS 23.280 [16]).\nFigure 10.6.2.3.1.1.2-1: Pre-arranged group call setup\n1.\tUser at MCPTT client 1 would like to initiate an MCPTT group call with a selected group (identified by MCPTT group ID). The MC service user may select a functional alias.\nNOTE 1:\tMCPTT client 1 need not be aware of the affiliation status of other MCPTT clients to the group while initiating the group call.\nNOTE 2:\tThe selected functional alias is not changed during the group call, i.e. a MCPTT client uses the same functional alias until the group call is released or the MCPTT client has left the group call.\n2.\tMCPTT client 1 sends a group call request towards the MCPTT server via the SIP core, which hosts the group selected by the user and identified by MCPTT group ID. The group call request also contains the MCPTT group ID and an SDP offer containing the MCPTT client media parameters. If there is a floor request to transmit, then the group call request contains an indication of an implicit floor request. If the MC service user of MCPTT client 1 has selected a functional alias, then the group call request contains that functional alias. If the group call request contains an implicit floor request it may also include location information.\n3.\tThe MCPTT server checks whether the user of MCPTT client 1 is authorized to initiate a group call for the selected group. If authorized and the group call is ongoing for that MCPTT group ID, the MCPTT server adds the requesting MCPTT client 1 to the existing MCPTT group call and notifies the MCPTT client 1 that the MCPTT group call is already in progress. Otherwise, MCPTT server resolves the MCPTT group ID to determine the members of that group and their affiliation status, based on the information from the group management server. The MCPTT server evaluates the applicable group call start criteria defined for this group (e.g. minimum number of affiliated members, specific members affiliated) and determines whether the group call setup can proceed.\nIf the functional alias is provided only in the group call request, or via binding, the MCPTT server proceeds with the value that is provided. If the functional alias is provided in both the group call request and via binding, it is up to the MCPTT server implementation to determine a value for the functional alias to be used.\nIf present, the MCPTT server checks whether the provided functional alias is allowed to be used and has been activated for the user.\nIf location information was included in the group call request, the MCPTT server checks the privacy policy of the MCPTT user to decide if the location information of MCPTT client 1 can be provided to other users on the call (refer to Annex A.3 \"Authorisation to provide location information to other MCPTT users on a call when talking\").\nNOTE 3:\tMCPTT server can have already retrieved the user/group configuration data and locally cached. If the user/group configuration data is not locally cached on the MCPTT server then MCPTT server requests the user/group configuration data from the MCPTT user database/group management server.\n4.\tMCPTT server includes information that it communicates using MCPTT service, offers the same media parameters or a subset of the media parameters contained in the initial received request and sends the corresponding group call request via the SIP core towards the MCPTT clients of each of those affiliated group members. MCPTT users are notified about the incoming group call and the functional alias of the group call initiating user is displayed if present. The MCPTT server indicates whether acknowledgement is required for the call and the functional alias of the group call initiating MC service user may be displayed.\n5.\tThe receiving MCPTT clients accept the group call request, and a group call response is sent to the group host MCPTT server. This response may contain an acknowledgement. The conditions for sending acknowledgement may be based on configuration. The response may also contain a functional alias of the responding MC service user, which is verified (valid and activated for the user) by the MCPTT server.\n6.\tMCPTT server sends the group call response including the selected media parameters to the MCPTT client 1 through the signalling path to inform about successful call establishment. The response may contain the functional alias, which may be displayed.\nNOTE 4:\tStep 6 can occur at any time following step 4b, and prior to step 7 depending on the conditions to proceed with the call.\n7.\tIf the initiating MCPTT user requires the acknowledgement from affiliated MCPTT group members, and the required MCPTT group members do not acknowledge the call setup within a configured time (the \"acknowledged call setup timeout\"), then the MCPTT server may proceed with or abandon the call and then notify the initiating MCPTT user that the acknowledgements did not include all required members according to group policy from the group configuration. The MCPTT server may notify the initiating MCPTT user of all MCPTT group members who did not acknowledge the group call request within the configured time. This notification may be sent to the initiating MCPTT user by the MCPTT server more than once during the call when MCPTT users join or leave the MCPTT group call.\n8.\tMCPTT client 1, client 2 and client 3 have successfully established media plane for communication. MCPTT floor participant 1, floor participant 2 and floor participant 3 exchange floor control information e.g., MCPTT client 1 receives the floor granted information over the established media plane assuming implicit floor control request from MCPTT client 1 while at the same time floor participants at other MCPTT client's receive floor taken information. MCPTT client 1 indicates to the MCPTT user that the floor is available to send media, while the other MCPTT clients in the group call will be receiving that media. If audio cut-in policy is enabled for the MCPTT group, floor arbitration follows the logic defined in subclause 10.9.1.5.\nNOTE 5:\tThe clients use the same functional alias within floor control procedures as used during group call setup.\n10.6.2.3.1.1.3\tRelease pre-arranged group call\nThe procedure focuses on the case where an MCPTT server initiates the termination of an ongoing MCPTT group call for all the participants of that group call, since at least one of the termination conditions are met e.g., due to hang time expiry, last participant leaving, second last participant leaving, initiator leaving, or minimum number of affiliated MCPTT group members are not present.\nProcedures in figure 10.6.2.3.1.1.3-1 are the signalling control plane procedures for the MCPTT server initiating termination of an ongoing MCPTT group call.\nFigure 10.6.2.3.1.1.3-1: Release pre-arranged group call\n1.\tIt is assumed that MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1, client 2 and client 3 are already part of the ongoing group call (e.g., as a result of pre-arranged group call setup).\n2.\tMCPTT server would like to release the MCPTT group call which is ongoing e.g., due to hang time expiry, last participant leaving, second last participant leaving, initiator leaving, or minimum number of affiliated MCPTT group members are not present.\n3.\tMCPTT server identifies the participants of the ongoing group call and generates group call release request to release ongoing session.\n4.\tMCPTT server sends a group call release request via SIP core towards each participant of the ongoing group call.\n5.\tMCPTT users are notified about the release of the group call.\n6.\tMCPTT client(s) receiving group call release request, acknowledge towards the MCPTT server by sending a group call release response.\n7. MCPTT client 1, client 2 and client 3 have successfully released the floor control and media plane resources associated with the group call that is terminated.\n10.6.2.3.1.1.4\tLate entry pre-arranged group call\nProcedures in figure 10.6.2.3.1.1.4-1 are the signalling control plane procedures for the MCPTT server requesting a newly affiliated member or a member coming back from out of coverage to join an ongoing MCPTT group call.\nNOTE:\tThis procedure applies to all types of group call, including, for example, emergency call, imminent peril call and broadcast call.\nPre-condition:\n1.\tMCPTT group is previously defined on the group management server with MCPTT users affiliated to that group. All members of the group belong to the same MCPTT system.\n2.\tIt is assumed that MCPTT users on MCPTT client 2 to MCPTT client n are on an ongoing call. Optionally, the MCPTT users may use activated functional aliases.\nFigure 10.6.2.3.1.1.4-1: Late entry pre-arranged group call\n1.\tMCPTT server determines that MCPTT client 1 which is newly affiliated or coming back from out of coverage has to be invited to join an ongoing group call (late entry).\n2.\tMCPTT server generates group call request including the information such as MCPTT service identifier (possible for the SIP core to route the request to the MCPTT server), MCPTT group ID of the group invited to join, offer one or more media types and sends towards the MCPTT client 1 via SIP core.\n3.\tMCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is notified about the incoming group call.\n4.\tUpon MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 accepting the incoming group call request, MCPTT client 1 sends the group call response including the selected media types to the MCPTT server through the signalling path. If the incoming group call request is rejected by the MCPTT client 1, the MCPTT server should not resend the group call request. The group call response may also contain a functional alias of MCPTT client 1.\n5.\tMCPTT client 1 is successfully added to the ongoing group call and MCPTT users at MCPTT client 1 to MCPTT client n may be notified about the MCPTT client 1 joining the group call and the functional alias of MCPTT client 1 may be displayed.\n6.\tThe floor taken with the information of the current talker is sent to MCPTT client1.\n10.6.2.3.1.1.5\tRejoining call\nProcedures in figure 10.6.2.3.1.1.5-1 are the signalling control plane procedures for the MCPTT client to rejoin an ongoing MCPTT group call (e.g. coming back from out of coverage).\nPre-conditions:\n-\tIt is assumed that MCPTT users on MCPTT client 2 to MCPTT client n are on an ongoing call.

      "content": "10.6.2.3.1.2.1\tGeneral\nIn a chat group (restricted) call model, the MCPTT user individually joins a group call without being invited. The establishment of a chat group (restricted) call does not result in other group members being invited.\nFigure 10.6.2.3.1.2.2-1 describes the basic procedure for the MCPTT client initiating an MCPTT group call which uses the chat group (restricted) call model. Restricted means that only users that have been configured as members of the given group are allowed to join the group communications for the given group.\nChat group join mechanism:\n-\tEach MCPTT client sends a group join request when the MCPTT user wants to participate in the group communication for the group. (This message does not impact the MCPTT user's membership in the group; the MCPTT server will verify that the MCPTT user is an authorized member of the group.)\n-\tThe group join request may include a request to transmit. If the group join request includes a request to transmit it may also include location information. It is assumed that the group join request will be delivered from MCPTT client to MCPTT server using SIP.\n-\tIf location information was included in the group join request, the MCPTT server checks the privacy policy of the MCPTT user to decide if the location information of MCPTT client 1 can be provided to other users on the call (refer to Annex A.3 \"Authorisation to provide location information to other MCPTT users on a call when talking\").\n-\tThe group join request is used to indicate to the MCPTT server that the MCPTT user associated with the given MCPTT client wishes to participate i.e. begin to receive media from or send media to the group.\n-\tThe group join request shall cause the MCPTT server to generate an implicit affiliation for the MCPTT user to the group, if the user is not already affiliated to the group.\n-\tThe group join request contains the information needed to negotiate media parameters (on demand) or to associate a pre-established session between MCPTT server and MCPTT client for the group call. The group join request can take the form of a SIP invite.\n-\tA selected functional alias is not changed by a MCPTT client during the whole participation within a chat group call, i.e. a MCPTT client uses the same functional alias selected when joining the chat group call until the chat group call is released or the MCPTT client leaves the chat group call.\nSubsequent participation in a group call when the group is using the chat model:\n-\tOnce an MCPTT client successfully joins a group call which is using the chat model, the MCPTT client connects to the media plane for the call if the call is currently ongoing.\n-\tIf the MCPTT group call is not currently ongoing (i.e.: when MCPTT clients on the group call are not sending or receiving media, and the time out between floor control exchanges has expired) then the newly joined MCPTT client will only have pre-established its media parameters for the call.\n-\tIf the newly joined MCPTT user wishes to transmit media (start or re-start the call) to the other joined users of the group using the chat model, then the MCPTT client shall use a normal floor control procedure for requesting the floor.\n-\tSince subsequent group call media transmissions are controlled using floor control signalling, additional SIP signalling messages may not be required for subsequent call stop and start.\n-\tEach request to transmit from an MCPTT user could be viewed as a new instance of a group call for the given group when the floor idle timer expires and no media is present for an extended time.\n-\tThe MCPTT server may tear down the media plane between successive group calls using the chat model, or the MCPTT server may allow the media plane to remain up between successive group calls using the chat model depending on resources.\nLeaving and releasing a chat group:\n-\tWhen a user wants to leave a chat group call, the client shall send a group call leave request to the server and release the media plane.\n-\tThe server can release a chat group call by sending a group call release to all joined clients. A server initiated release also releases the media plane for all joined clients.\n10.6.2.3.1.2.2\tChat group call setup\nMCPTT client 1, client 2, and client 3 are served by the home MCPTT service provider in figure 10.6.2.3.1.2.2-1.\nPre-condition:\n1.\tMCPTT user 2 and MCPTT user 3 have previously joined (affiliated) to the group. MCPTT client 1, client 2, and client 3 are registered and all users (MCPTT user 1, user 2, and user 3) have been authenticated and authorized to use the MCPTT service.\n2.\tMCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 may have activated functional alias(es) configured to be used during the group call communication. No call is currently in progress for the group.\n3.\tOptionally the MCPTT user on MCPTT client 1 has bound a functional alias to the MCPTT group ID (3GPP TS 23.280 [16]).\nFigure 10.6.2.3.1.2.2-1: MCPTT chat group call\n1.\tMCPTT user 1 indicates to join the group communication for the group. This may include a request to transmit.\n1a.\tMCPTT client 1 sends a group join request with the MCPTT group ID of the desired group. It contains the MCPTT user's MCPTT ID, the MCPTT client media parameters and optionally a functional alias. If there is a request to transmit, then the group joint request contains an indication of an implicit floor request. If the group join request includes an implicit floor request it may also include location information.\n1b.\tThe MCPTT server receives the group join request. MCPTT server generates an implicit affiliation (if the MCPTT user is not already affiliated to the group) and verifies that MCPTT user 1 is authorized to affiliate to the group by following the affiliation procedure (subclause 10.8.3 in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16]).\nIf the functional alias is provided only in the group call request, or via binding, the MCPTT server proceeds with the value that is provided. If the functional alias is provided in both the group call request and via binding, it is up to the MCPTT server implementation to determine a value for the functional alias to be used.\nIf present, the MCPTT server checks whether the provided functional alias is allowed to be used and has been activated for the user.\nIf location information was included in the group join request, the MCPTT server checks the privacy policy of the MCPTT user to decide if the location information of MCPTT client 1 can be provided to other users on the call (refer to Annex A.3 \"Authorisation to provide location information to other MCPTT users on a call when talking\").\n1c.\tThe MCPTT server replies with a group join response indicating the acceptance of the group join request and also returns the MCPTT server selected media parameters for the group call in the group join response.\n2.\tIf MCPTT user 1 requests to transmit, the MCPTT server establishes the media plane (if not already established) for the call. The associated floor participants for MCPTT client 1, client 2, and client 3 use the floor control procedure to initiate the call. E.g., the floor participant for MCPTT client 1 receives the MCPTT floor grant. The corresponding floor participants for MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 receive the MCPTT floor taken. If present, the functional alias of MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 are displayed where appropriate.\n3.\tFloor control will continue to be used by the floor participants associated with MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 for the duration of the call. Media plane signalling using floor control will be used for subsequent calls for the group as long as one or more users are affiliated. If audio cut-in policy is enabled for the MCPTT group, floor arbitration follows the logic defined in subclause 10.9.1.5.\n10.6.2.3.1.2.3\tRelease chat group call\nThe procedure describes the case where the MCPTT server releases an ongoing MCPTT group call for all the participants of that group call, since at least one of the conditions for release are met e.g. due to hang time expiry, last participant leaving, second last participant leaving, initiator leaving, or the number of affiliated MCPTT group members is below the minimum number permitted.\nNOTE 1:\tThe procedure for an MCPTT user leaving the group call is a different procedure.\nProcedures in figure 10.6.2.3.1.2.3-1 are the procedures for the MCPTT server initiating the release of an ongoing MCPTT group call.\nThe following precondition applies:\n- A group call is ongoing between MCPTT clients 1, 2 and 3\nFigure 10.6.2.3.1.2.3-1: Release chat group call\n1.\tMCPTT server would like to release the MCPTT group call which is ongoing e.g., due to hang time expiry, last participant leaving, second last participant leaving, initiator leaving, or minimum number of affiliated MCPTT group members are not present.\n2.\tMCPTT server identifies the participants of the ongoing group call and generates group call release request to release the ongoing session.\n3.\tMCPTT server sends a group call release request towards each participant of the ongoing group call.\nNOTE 2:\tThe group call release request can also be sent over SIP signalling on the signalling plane.\n4.\tMCPTT users are notified about the release of the group call.\n5.\tOptionally the MCPTT client(s) receiving group call release request, may send a group call release response to the MCPTT server.\nNOTE 3:\tThe MCPTT client can send group call release response when the group call release request is sent using a unicast bearer.\n6.\tMCPTT client 1, client 2 and client 3 release the floor control and media plane resources associated with the group call that is released.

The emergency state of the group may alternatively be cancelled by the emergency alert cancellation procedure specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16], subclause 10.10.1.2.2.2.\nProcedures in figure 10.6.2.6.1.3-1 are the signalling control plane procedures for the MCPTT client cancelling an in-progress emergency of a group.\nNOTE 2:\tFor simplicity, a single MCPTT server is shown in place of a user home MCPTT server and a group hosting MCPTT server.\nNOTE 3:\tThe end of the MCPTT emergency group call does not cancel the MCPTT group's in-progress emergency state. It is explicitly cancelled by an authorized user using this procedure, or by the emergency alert cancellation procedure specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16], subclause 10.10.1.2.2.2.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe MCPTT group is previously defined on the group management server with MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 affiliated to that MCPTT group.\n2.\tAll members of the MCPTT group belong to the same MCPTT system.\n3.\tMCPTT group members have been notified about the in-progress emergency.\n4.\tThe MCPTT group is in the in-progress emergency state and has prioritized bearer support when a call is in progress.\n5.\tMCPTT client 1 is authorized to cancel an in-progress emergency for the group.\nFigure 10.6.2.6.1.3-1: MCPTT in-progress emergency group state cancel\n1.\tThe user at the MCPTT client 1 initiates an MCPTT in-progress emergency group state cancel.\nNOTE 4:\tAn authorized user (e.g. dispatcher, supervisor) can cancel either or both the in-progress emergency state of the group and the MC service emergency alert of another user. However, only the initiator of an MCPTT emergency alert can cancel the initiator's local MCPTT emergency state. Determination of authorized users is implementation dependent.\n2.\tMCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT in-progress emergency group state cancel request to the MCPTT server.\nNOTE 5:\tIf an MCPTT emergency alert relating to MCPTT client 1 is in effect together with an MCPTT in-progress emergency group state on the MCPTT group, the MCPTT emergency alert of MCPTT client 1 can be cancelled at the same time. In that case, the MCPTT in-progress emergency group state cancel request carries an indication that the emergency alert of MCPTT client 1 is also being cancelled.\nNOTE 6:\tIf an MCPTT in-progress emergency group state cancel request is received by the MCPTT server while a group member that is in the emergency state is transmitting, the MCPTT in-progress emergency group state cancel request is rejected by the MCPTT server.\n3.\tMCPTT server resolves the MCPTT group ID to determine the members of that MCPTT group and their affiliation status, based upon the information from group management server.\n4.\tThe MCPTT server verifies that the user of MCPTT client 1 is authorized to cancel the emergency state of this MCPTT group. The MCPTT server cancels/resets the in-progress emergency state of the MCPTT group.\n5.\tIf a call is currently in progress, the MCPTT server adjusts the priority of the underlying bearer; priority treatment is no longer required.\n6.\tThe MCPTT server sends an MCPTT in-progress emergency group state cancel request to the MCPTT group members.\n7.\tMCPTT group members are notified of the MCPTT in-progress emergency group state cancel.\n8.\tThe receiving MCPTT clients send the MCPTT in-progress emergency group state cancel response to the MCPTT server to acknowledge the MCPTT in-progress emergency group state cancel. For a multicast call scenario, these acknowledgements are not sent.\n9.\tThe MCPTT server sends the MCPTT in-progress emergency group state cancel response to the MCPTT user 1 to confirm the MCPTT in-progress emergency group state cancel. If the MCPTT in-progress emergency group state cancel request (in step 2) contained the \"Alert indicator\" IE, the MCPTT client 1 resets its local emergency status.\nNOTE 7:\tStep 9 can occur at any time following step 4, depending on the conditions to proceed with the call.",

If the group management server in the primary MCPTT of the regroup group shares the necessary security related parameters together with the group configuration of the MCPTT regroup group with the group management server in the partner MCPTT system and the group management server in the partner MCPTT system distributes this configuration including those security parameters to its served MCPTT users according to the procedures in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16] subclause 10.2.7, the primary MCPTT system does not need to be aware of the list of group members of the preconfigured regroup group that are receiving service in the partner MCPTT system.\nThe procedure takes place prior to the establishment of a group call to the regroup group.\nIn this procedure, any gateway MC servers in the primary or partner MCPTT systems are not shown.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tMCPTT client 1 is authorized to initiated a preconfigured regroup procedure, and is receiving MCPTT service in the primary MCPTT system of MCPTT client 1.\n-\tMCPTT client 2 is an affiliated member of MCPTT group 1 where MCPTT group 1 is defined in the partner MCPTT system and MCPTT client 2 is receiving service in the partner MCPTT system of MCPTT client 1.\n-\tThe MCPTT group identity and group configuration for the regroup MCPTT group have been preconfigured in MCPTT client 2, and MCPTT client 2 has received the relevant security related information to allow communication in the regroup MCPTT group.\n-\tIn order to be aware whether the group is regrouped, the MCPTT server is subscribed to the group configuration in GMS.\n-\tThe GMS has subscribed group dynamic data as specified in subclause 10.1.5.5.1 from the MCPTT server within the same MCPTT system using the procedures defined in subclause 10.1.5.6 in TS 23.280 [16].\nFigure 10.6.2.9.3.1-1: Regroup procedure using preconfigured group in multiple MCPTT systems\n1.\tThe authorized user of MCPTT client 1 initiates the regroup procedure, specifying the list of MCPTT groups to be regrouped including MCPTT group 1, the MCPTT group ID of the regroup group (if available) and the MCPTT group ID of the group from which configuration information for the regroup group is to be taken.\n2.\tMCPTT client 1 sends the preconfigured regroup request to the MCPTT server.\n3.\tThe MCPTT server checks that MCPTT client 1 is authorized to initiate a preconfigured regroup procedure, and resolves the group identities of the MCPTT groups requested in step 1. The MCPTT server also checks which group members are affiliated to the requested MCPTT groups that are homed in the primary MCPTT system. The MCPTT server identifies any partner systems which are the group home systems for MCPTT groups identified in the list of groups to be regrouped. The MCPTT server may retrieve the configuration for the regroup group from the GMS if that configuration information is not already known to the MCPTT server. If the preconfigured regroup request is authorized, the MCPTT server assigns a MCPTT group ID for this regroup group call if:\ni. one is not provided in the request or\nii. the one provided in the request is not accepted.\nNOTE 1:\tThis procedure does not require that the authorized user of MCPTT client 1 is a group member of the MCPTT groups listed in the regroup request, or that the authorized user of MCPTT client 1 is an affiliated group member of any of the listed MCPTT groups.\n4a.\tIf the MCPTT server determines that any of the groups requested for regrouping, including the regroup group, have been regrouped by other group regrouping procedures, the MCPTT server then sends a preconfigured regroup reject back to MCPTT client 1 with a reject reason indicating that one of the groups has already been regrouped, and this procedure terminates.\n4b. The MCPTT server shall send the preconfigured regroup request return message to MCPTT client 1 containing the below:\ni.\tthe MCPTT group ID is generated by the MCPTT server; and\nii.\tresult of whether the ad hoc group call is authorized or not\nIf the preconfigured regroup request is not authorized, MCPTT client 1 shall not proceed with the rest of the steps.\n5.\tThe MCPTT server sends the preconfigured regroup requests to the MCPTT server in the partner MCPTT system.\n6.\tThe partner MCPTT server checks the status of any MCPTT groups hosted by that partner MCPTT server, and identifies affiliated group members of any of the identified MCPTT groups (both MCPTT groups that are hosted in the primary MCPTT system and MCPTT groups that are hosted in the partner MCPTT system) that are receiving MCPTT service in the partner MCPTT system, which include MCPTT client 2.\n7.\tThe partner MCPTT server sends the preconfigured regroup request to MCPTT client 2.\nNOTE 2:\tOnly group members that are affiliated to the MCPTT groups that are to be regrouped are sent a preconfigured regroup request.\n8.\tMCPTT client 2 notifies the user of the regrouping.\n9.\tMCPTT client 2 may send the preconfigured regroup response to the partner MCPTT server to acknowledge the regrouping action. This acknowledgement is not sent in response to a multicast transmission of the preconfigured regroup request.\n10.\tThe partner MCPTT server affiliates the regrouped MCPTT client 2 to the regroup group.\n11.\tThe MCPTT server sends a preconfigured regroup response to the primary MCPTT server.\n12.\tThe primary MCPTT server sends the preconfigured regroup response to MCPTT client 1.\nAfter the group regrouping procedure, the regrouping remains in effect until explicitly cancelled by the procedure in 10.6.2.9.3.2.\nMCPTT client participation in the ongoing regroup persists until the MCPTT client is no longer affiliated to any of the regrouped groups (group 1 or 2 in this procedure).\nMCPTT client affiliation to the regroup group may cease when the UE's MCPTT service ceases, e.g. when the UE is powered down, or by performing a log-off operation.\nEditor's note:\tData persistence in the MCPTT client following a user log-off or power down needs further study.",

The ProSe Layer-2 Group ID of the target MCPTT group may be used by the ProSe layer as the target group info and the discovery group ID (defined in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7]).\nPrior to the establishment of an off-network group call, a group member discovery procedure may be initiated to identify whether other members of the target MCPTT group are in the proximity of the calling MCPTT user, as described in the ProSe direct discovery for public safety use procedure in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7]. The establishment of an off-network group call using the ProSe capability is based on the one-to-many ProSe direct communication procedure for public safety use described in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7].\nOff-network group calls can use pre-defined configuration information provided to MCPTT clients prior to the off-network group call or configuration information that is transmitted to MCPTT clients during group call setup or late entry procedures.\nIf off-network group configuration information is pre-defined (e.g. codec to be used) and provided to the MCPTT clients prior to the off-network group call (e.g. as part of group metadata), the MCPTT client will be able to participate in the off-network group call without needing to follow the group call setup or late joining procedures as they will be able to receive the media and signalling without the need for the announcement or invitation.\nIf off-network group configuration information is not pre-defined or provided, call parameters need to be transmitted to MCPTT clients via group call announcement or invitation.\nNOTE:\tWhen the MCPTT client receives a message that is not addressed to either its MCPTT ID or to any MCPTT group of which the MCPTT client is an affiliated group member, the MCPTT client ignores the message.",

The MCPTT private call request contains the MCPTT ID or the functional alias of the invited user, an SDP offer containing one or more media types. For a private call with floor control, the MCPTT private call request also contains an element that indicates that MCPTT client 1 is requesting the floor. The MCPTT client 1 may include a Requested commencement mode that indicates that the call is to be established in automatic commencement mode if automatic commencement mode is requested by the initiating user.\nNOTE 1:\tAs part of this step, MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 set up a security association (when no functional alias is present), if end-to-end encryption is used for this call.\n4.\tIf the MCPTT private call request contains a functional alias instead of an MCPTT ID as called party, the MCPTT server shall resolve the functional alias to the corresponding MCPTT ID(s) for which the functional alias is active.

The MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 may include a functional alias used within the MCPTT private call. For a private call with floor control, floor control is to be established. For private call without floor control, both users will have the ability to transmit without floor arbitration.\n3.\tMCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT private call request addressed to the MCPTT ID of MCPTT user 2 using an MCPTT service identifier as defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [5] (possible for the SIP core to route the request to the MCPTT server). The MCPTT private call request contains the MCPTT ID or the functional alias of invited user and an SDP offer containing one or more media types. The MCPTT private call request may also contain a data element that indicates that MCPTT client 1 is requesting the floor, for a private call with floor control. The MCPTT client 1 may include a requested commencement mode that indicates that the call is to be established in manual commencement mode if manual commencement mode is requested by the initiating user.\nNOTE 1:\tAs part of this step, MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 set up a security association (when no functional alias is present), if end-to-end encryption is used for this call.\n4.\tThe MCPTT server confirms that both MCPTT users are authorized for the private call. MCPTT server verifies whether the provided functional alias, if present, can be used and has been activated for the user.

      "content": "When an MCPTT user using a ProSe-enabled UE wants to communicate with a specific MCPTT user using a ProSe-enabled UE by a ProSe mechanism, the MCPTT client enables the use of the ProSe layer procedures for public safety, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7].\nThe MCPTT client obtains configuration data such as the ProSe discovery group ID and user info ID of the target MCPTT user from the \"List of user(s) who can be called in private call\" in the MCPTT user profile and requests the IP address of the MCPTT UE associated with the target MCPTT user from the ProSe layer.\nThe MCPTT client enables the ProSe layer to determine the IP address for the communication with the target MCPTT UE by providing the ProSe discovery group ID and user info ID (as defined in specification 3GPP TS 23.303 [7]) of the target MCPTT user. This may trigger the ProSe direct discovery for public safety use procedure, described in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7], to identify whether the target MCPTT user is in the proximity of the calling MCPTT user. The user info ID of the target MCPTT user is used by the ProSe layer as the target info (as defined in specification 3GPP TS 23.303 [7]).\nThe ProSe layer can then provide the IP address related to the target MCPTT user's MCPTT ID to the MCPTT client. The establishment of the off-network private call using the ProSe capability is based on the one-to-one ProSe direct communication procedure described in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7].\nNOTE:\tThe ProSe procedures for one-to-one direct communications specified in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7] retrieves a layer-2 ID associated with the user info ID of the target MCPTT user by the discovery procedure to establish direct communications between ProSe users.",

The MCPTT server increments the redirection counter for immediate forwardings. If the target of the MCPTT private call forwarding is a functional alias instead of an MCPTT ID the MCPTT server resolves the functional alias to the corresponding MCPTT ID for which the functional alias is active.\nNOTE 1:\tDepending on implementation the MCPTT server can apply additional call restrictions and decide whether the call is allowed to proceed with the resolved MCPTT ID(s) (e.g. whether the MCPTT ID is within the allowed area of the functional alias). If the MCPTT server detects that the functional alias used as the target of the MCPTT private call forwarding is simultaneously active for multiple MCPTT users, then the MCPTT server can proceed by selecting an appropriate MCPTT ID based on some selection criteria (e.g. current location of the initiating user to determine the dispatcher who is responsible for the related geographic area). The selection of an appropriate MCPTT ID is left to implementation. The selection criteria can include rejection of the call, if no suitable MCPTT ID is selected.\n3a.\tIf the target of the call forwarding is a functional alias that is not active, or if the target functional is simultaneously active by multiple users and the outcome of the selection is a rejection, the MCPTT private call forwarding is cancelled, and the MCPTT server sends an MCPTT private call cancel request towards MCPTT client 1.

      "content": "The procedures defined in this subclause provide floor control to MCPTT UEs in off-network operation. The procedures apply to both private calls and group calls.\nIn off-network, floor control is performed by using floor control messages among the MCPTT clients without centralized MCPTT server. The MCPTT client can transmit voice packets once it is granted the right to speak, either locally in the UE or by reception of a floor granted message from another MCPTT client.\nIn off-network, the MCPTT client currently speaking performs the temporary floor arbitrator during speaking since there is no centralized MCPTT floor control server. The floor arbitrator controls the floor whether or not queue is supported, and when floor is requested with override. If queue is supported, the MCPTT client performing floor arbitrator grants the right to speak to the next speaker and transfers the floor arbitrator role after completing the voice transfer and releasing the floor. For group calls, the floor arbitrator also transfers the floor control queue when granting the floor. The next MCPTT client receiving the right to speak becomes the new floor arbitrator and, for group calls, has the floor control queue.\nFor group calls, the floor control message is delivered in multicast based communication and can be monitored by all the members within the MCPTT group.\nThe following information flows apply among MCPTT clients.\n-\tFloor request (from the floor participants to the floor arbitrator): used to request a floor for voice transfer.\n-\tFloor release (from the floor arbitrator to the floor participants): used to inform that the voice transfer is completed and the floor is released.\n-\tFloor granted (from the floor arbitrator to a floor participant): used to indicate that the request for floor is granted, that voice transfer is possible and the current queue list.\n-\tQueue position request (from the floor participant to the floor arbitrator): used to request the position in the floor request queue.\n-\tQueue position info (from the floor arbitrator to the floor participant): used to indicate the floor request is queued and the current queue status.\n-\tFloor rejected (from the floor arbitrator to the floor participant): used to indicate that a request for the floor is rejected.\n-\tFloor taken (from the floor arbitrator to the floor participant): used to indicate the floor is granted to another MCPTT user.",

If a pre-arranged group session is initiated the use of pre-established sessions are required.\nPre-conditions:\n-\tAll users participating in the MCPTT group call are already affiliated to the group.\n-\tAll participating users have joined the group session.\nFigure 10.10.4.2.1-1: Chat group call connect on MBMS bearer\n1.\tActivation and announcement of MBMS bearer availability.\nNOTE 1:\tThe procedure does not include the steps for MCPTT client location reporting, or for MBMS capability information exchange.\n2.\tMCPTT client 1 initiate the MCPTT group call by sending an initial floor request over a unicast bearer to the MCPTT server (reference point MCPTT-4).\n3.\tThe MCPTT server will send a MapGroupToBearer message over a previously activated MBMS bearer to all users that will receive the call over an MBMS bearer. The MapGroupToBearer message includes association information between the group call and MBMS bearer. The MapGroupToBearer message includes MCPTT group ID and information about the media stream identifier of the activated MBMS bearer and may include the identifier (i.e. the TMGI) of the MBMS bearer broadcasting the call. The message is sent over reference point MCPTT-9.\nNOTE 2:\tStep 3 can be deferred until step 5 and the MapGroupToBearer message can then be included in the floor taken message.\n4.\tThe MCPTT server grants the right to transmit for MCPTT client 1 and by that sends a floor granted message to the MCPTT client 1. This message is sent over a unicast bearer (reference point MCPTT-4).\n5.\tA floor taken message is sent from the MCPTT server to all receiving users. This message includes the MCPTT ID of the transmitting MCPTT client as well as the MCPTT group ID. The message is sent over a MBMS bearer to all users that have previously been setup to receive calls over the MBMS bearer. The message is sent over reference point MCPTT-9.\n6.\tThe media is sent from MCPTT client 1 to the MCPTT server over unicast bearer and from the MCPTT server to the MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 over MBMS bearer.\nNOTE 3:\tAdditional floor request messages in the same call will not trigger the MapGroupToBearer message to be sent.",

The figure 10.10.6.1-1 specifies a procedural flow to perform such decision.\nThe flow described evaluates which bearer type to use for a new MCPTT group call. It is assumed that if an MBMS bearer is active it is also announced to the MCPTT client.\nWhen using an MBMS bearer for application level control signalling, the announcement of an already active MBMS bearer could be part of the MCPTT group call setup, however that will have an impact on the call setup time.\nFigure 10.10.6.1-1: MBMS bearer decision flow\nOn a high level the procedure outcome is to use unicast or broadcast bearers for the new MCPTT group call.

      "content": "All clients are served by the primary MCPTT service provider in figure 10.15.3-1.\nPre-conditions:\n1.\tThe calling MCPTT user has selected first-to-answer call.\n2.\tMCPTT clients 1 to n are registered and their respective users, MCPTT user 1 to MCPTT user n, are authenticated and authorized to use the MCPTT service, as per procedure in subclause 10.2.\n3.\tMCPTT clients 2 to n have activated the same functional alias.\n4.\tThe MCPTT server has subscribed to the MCPTT functional alias controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-activation updates.\nFigure 10.15.3-1: MCPTT first-to-answer call – MCPTT users in the same MCPTT system\n1.\tMCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 would like to establish a MCPTT first-to-answer call indicating a set of potential target recipients or by calling a functional alias. For a MCPTT first-to-answer call with floor control, floor control is to be established. For first-to-answer call without floor control, both users will have the ability to transmit without floor arbitration.\n2.\tMCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT first-to-answer call request including a set of potential target recipients to the MCPTT server (via the SIP core as defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [5]), using either a list of MCPTT IDs or a functional alias. The MCPTT first-to-answer call request contains the MCPTT ID and may contain the functional alias of originating user and an SDP offer containing one or more media types. The MCPTT first-to-answer call request may also contain a data element that indicates that MCPTT client 1 is requesting the floor, for a first-to-answer call with floor control. The MCPTT client 1 includes a first-to-answer call indication that the call is to be established only to the first answering user.\n3.\tThe MCPTT server confirms that MCPTT users are authorized for the call and whether the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is authorized to initiate a first-to-answer call. The MCPTT server checks whether the provided functional alias of the calling user, if present, can be used and has been activated for the MCPTT user. If a functional alias is present, the MCPTT server shall also check whether MCPTT client 1 is allowed to use the functional alias of MCPTT client 2 (to MCPTT client n) to setup a private call and whether MCPTT client 2 (to MCPTT client n) is (are) allowed to receive a private call from MCPTT client 1 using a functional alias.\n4.\tThe MCPTT server determines the list of MCPTT users to send MCPTT first-to-answer call request, based on a set of allowed potential target recipients obtained from the request from MCPTT client 1. Alternatively, when a functional alias is used as target address, the MCPTT server resolves the functional alias to a corresponding list of related MCPTT IDs of MCPTT client 2 to MCPTT client n who have activated the functional alias. The functional alias must have been activated to identify the MCPTT IDs of the called users.\nNOTE 1:\tBased on some selection criteria (e.g. using the current location of the initiating user to determine the dispatchers that are responsible for the related geographic areas), the MCPTT server can send MCPTT first-to-answer call requests only to a sub-set of the MCPTT users that have activated the functional alias. The selection of the appropriate sub-set of MCPTT IDs is left to implementation.\n5a, 5b, 5c.\tThe MCPTT server includes information that it communicates using MCPTT service, offers the same media types or a subset of the media types contained in the initial received request and sends similar MCPTT first-to-answer call request to each potential target recipient, including the MCPTT ID and, if present, the functional alias of the calling MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1. If one or more called MCPTT users have registered to the MCPTT service with multiple MCPTT UEs and has designated the MCPTT UE for receiving the calls, then the incoming MCPTT first-to-answer call request is delivered only to the designated MCPTT UE. Otherwise MCPTT first-to-answer call request may be delivered to all the registered MCPTT UEs. If a functional alias is present and more than one MCPTT client has activated that functional alias, then the MCPTT server sends an MCPTT first-to-answer call request to each MCPTT client.\n6a, 6b, 6c.\tThe MCPTT users are alerted, regardless of the commencement mode.\n7.\tMCPTT user at MCPTT client 2 accepted the call which causes MCPTT client 2 to send an MCPTT first-to-answer call response to the MCPTT server.\nNOTE 2:\tMCPTT server does not divert MCPTT first-to-answer call to voicemail if MCPTT user at MCPTT client 2 has not accepted the incoming call.\n8.\tThe MCPTT server sends an MCPTT first-to-answer call response to MCPTT client 1 indicating that MCPTT user at MCPTT client 2 has accepted the call, including the accepted media parameters.\n9a.\tThe MCPTT server sends a MCPTT first-to-answer call cancel request to MCPTT client 3.\n9b.\tOptionally, MCPTT client 3 notifies the user.\n10a.\tThe MCPTT server sends a MCPTT first-to-answer call cancel request to MCPTT client n.\n10b.\tOptionally, MCPTT client n notifies the user.\n11.\tThe media plane for communication is established. Either user can transmit media individually when using floor control. For successful call establishment for first-to-answer call with floor request from MCPTT client 1, the floor participant associated with MCPTT client 1 is granted the floor initially. At the same time the floor participant associated with MCPTT client 2 is informed that the floor is taken. For a first-to-answer call without floor control both users are allowed to transmit simultaneously.\nNOTE 3:\tPrior to media plane establishment, MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 set up a security association for the media, if end-to-end encryption is used for this call.\nEditor's note:\tIt is assumed that MCPTT client 1 initiates the set up as is done for private calls, but the details for the media security establishment are FFS and are in the scope of SA3. Results provided by SA3 may require changes in the procedure.\nNOTE 4:\tThe steps 9a ,10a and 11 can occur in any order and can also be performed in parallel.\n12.\tMCPTT client 3 sends an MCPTT first-to-answer cancel call response.\n13.\tMCPTT client n sends an MCPTT first-to-answer cancel call response.",

This is left for the implementation.\nFigure 10.19.3.1.1-1: Ad hoc group call setup\n1.\tUser at MCPTT client 1 would like to initiate an ad hoc group call. The MCPTT client 1 initiates the ad hoc group call by sending the ad hoc group call request containing the list of participants or an ad hoc group ID from an ad hoc group emergency alert to the MCPTT server. Encryption supported information element shall be set to true since end-to-end encryption is supported. An SDP offer containing the MCPTT client media parameters is included. If there is a floor request to transmit, then the ad hoc group call request contains an indication of an implicit floor request. If the MCPTT user of MCPTT client 1 has selected a functional alias, then the ad hoc group call request contains that functional alias.

The configuration data in each configuration category corresponds to a single instance of the category type i.e. the MCPTT UE, MCPTT group, MCPTT user and MCPTT service configuration data refers to the information that will be stored against each MCPTT UE, MCPTT group, MCPTT user and MCPTT service. This means that the three separate tables (on-network and off-network, on-network only, off-network only) for each configuration category represent the complete set of data for each configuration data category element.\nThe columns in the tables have the following meanings:\n-\tReference: the reference of the corresponding requirement in 3GPP TS 22.179 [2] or 3GPP TS 22.280 [17] or 3GPP TS 23.280 [16] or the corresponding subclause from the present document.\n-\tParameter description: A short definition of the semantics of the corresponding item of data, including denotation of the level of the parameter in the configuration hierarchy.\n-\tWhen it is not clear to which functional entities the parameter is configured, then one or more columns indicating this are provided where the following nomenclature is used:\n-\t\"Y\" to denote \"Yes\" i.e. the parameter denoted for the row needs to be configured to the functional entity denoted for the column.\n-\t\"N\" to denote \"No\" i.e. the parameter denoted for the row does not need to be configured to the functional entity denoted for the column.\nParameters within a set of configuration data have a level within a hierarchy that pertains only to that configuration data. The hierarchy of the configuration data is common across all three tables of on-network and off-network, on network only and off network only. The level of a parameter within the hierarchy of the configuration data is denoted by use of the character \">\" in the parameter description field within each table, one per level. Parameters that are at the top most level within the hierarchy have no \">\" character. Parameters that have one or more \">\" characters are child parameters of the first parameter above them that has one less \">\" character. Parent parameters are parameters that have one or more child parameters. Parent parameters act solely as a \"grouping\" of their child parameters and therefore do not contain an actual value themselves i.e. they are just containers for their child parameters.\nEach parameter that can be configured online shall only be configured through one online reference point. Each parameter that can be configured offline shall only be configured through one offline reference point. The most recent configuration data made available to the MCPTT UE shall always overwrite previous configuration data, irrespective of whether the configuration data was provided via the online or offline mechanism.\nA.2\tMCPTT UE configuration data\nThe general aspects of UE configuration are specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16]. Data in tables A.2-1 and A.2-2 have to be known by the MCPTT UE after MCPTT authorization.\nData in table A.2-1 can be configured offline using the CSC-11 reference point. Table A.2-2 contains the UE configuration required to support the use of off-network MCPTT service.\nTable A.2-1: UE configuration data (on and off network)\nReference\nParameter description\n[R-5. 4.2-002] of 3GPP TS 22.280 [17]\nMaximum number of simultaneous group calls (Nc4)\n[R-5.4.2-003] of 3GPP TS 22.280 [17]\nMaximum number of transmissions (Nc5) in a group\n[R-5.5.2-007] of 3GPP TS 22.280 [17]\nMaximum number of private calls (N10)\nTable A.2-2: UE configuration data (on network)\nReference\nParameter description\nSubclause 5.2.3 of 3GPP TS 23.280 [16]\nRelay service (Y/N)\nSubclause 5.2.3 of 3GPP TS 23.280 [16]\nList of allowed relayed MCPTT groups and their relay service code (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7]) (optional) (see NOTE)\n> MCPTT group ID\n> Relay service code (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7])\nNOTE:\tWhen the value of the parameter Relay service is N, this parameter and its child parameters are not needed.\nA.3\tMCPTT user profile configuration data\nThe general aspects of MC service user profile configuration data are specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16]. The MCPTT user profile configuration data is stored in the MCPTT user database. The MCPTT server obtains the MCPTT user profile configuration data from the MCPTT user database (MCPTT-2).\nTables A.3-1 and A.3-2 contain the MCPTT user profile configuration required to support the use of on-network MCPTT service. Tables A.3-1 and A.3-3 contain the MCPTT user profile configuration required to support the use of off-network MCPTT service. Data in table A.3-1 and A.3-3 can be configured offline using the CSC-11 reference point.\nTable A.3-1: MCPTT user profile data (on and off network)\nReference\nParameter description\nMCPTT UE\nMCPTT
