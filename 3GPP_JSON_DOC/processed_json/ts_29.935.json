      "section_title": "MMTEL data with an HSS-FE",
      "content": "With a HSS-FE, SMMTEL data are transported over a Sh interface as transparent data within repository data. Then, regarding to the storage on the UDR by the HSS-FE, two sub-cases are identified:\n-\tIt is normally stored as transparent data in the UDR in the same way as any other transparent data coming from an AS over Sh, so not requiring a data modelling of the MMTEL data over the Ud between a HSS-FE and the UDR.\n-\tThe transparent data is analysed by the HSS-FE application logic and translated into data complying with the MMTEL RDM over Ud. In the other way, the HSS-FE application logic builds a Sh transparent data from the MMTEL data retrieved from the UDR and complying with the MMTEL RDM over Ud. It is to be noted that the concept of transparent data that still applies to Sh is no more applied on the transparent storage in the HSS in this sub-case.\nTo address the second sub-case, the HSS-FE will rely on the standardisation of MMTEL Data over Sh in 3GPP TS 29.364 [19]. Two coding options are defined, a binary one and a XML one. An objective is that the same MMTEL RDM over Ud can be mapped with both options. The same MMTEL RDM should also be applicable to the case described in 4.2.2. This is out of the scope in the present release of the specifications.\nWith the XML option, the data configuring each of the CDIV and CB MMTEL Services is structured in a set of multiple rules, each rule may contain multiple conditions and an action, structure that was not retained for the binary option aimed to handle the subset of MMTEL services corresponding to PSTN/ISDN and CS supplementary services.\nHow the MMTEL RDM over Ud can address the configuration data for CDIV and CB services for both the XML and the binary option is out of the scope in the present release of the specifications.",

It may drive to maintain the consistency between the MMTEL services and the CS supplementary services. Two approaches that impact RDM for Ud may be considered:\n-\tMMTEL Data and CS supplementary Service data are considered as separate data in the RDM for Ud, considering that their consistency will be handled by the concerned application logics. This approach may be more in line with current 3GPP specifications where CS supplementary Services and MMTEL services are defined in different 3GPP specifications.\n-\tA subset of MMTEL data and CS supplementary service data are merged in the RDM over Ud and describe a supplementary service independently of the access (CS or PS). This approach may impact stage 1 and stage 2 specifications on supplementary services.\nWhich one of the two approaches is the most relevant and if it impacts existing specifications on supplementary services (CS and MMTEL) is out of the scope in the present release of the specifications.",

The operator has to choose between these alternatives. The RDM specification for MMTEL and CS Supplementary services should allow these two approaches.\nOnly a subset of MMTEL Supplementary Services defined in [19] is shared with the Circuit domain.\nHere are described three possible structures of the RDM.\nFigure 4.2.5-1: Reference Data Model referring to MMTEL services\nFigure 4.2.5-2: Reference Data Model referring to CS services\nFigure 4.2.5-3: Reference Data Model referring to the common services\nDepending on the implementation any of the above data structures for MMTEL and CS SS or a combination of them can be selected for the RDM.",

      "content": "This section covers the information model for IMS Data and all its permanent data entities. The term IMS Data may also include temporary data as shown in the corresponding DITs.\nSome data entities are already defined in 3GPP TS 32.182 [3].\nFigure 11.3-1 covers some basic IMS entities with two possible approaches:\n-\tApproach A: where IMPU and PSI are considered as different basic entities;\n-\tApproach B: where a Public Identity basic IMS entity may identify a Public User Identity or a Public Service Identity and a Private Identity basic IMS entity may identify a Private User Identity or a Private Service Identity. The rational of Approach B is that Public User Identity and Public Service Identity have many common points. They have the same inheritance diagram with SIP URI or Tel URI. Public User Identity or Public Service Identity have compatible associations with other entities such as IMS Data or IMS Service profile. This modelling reduces the number of IMS basic entities and associations. Then, the differentiation between a Public User Identity and a Public Service Identity may be done by an attribute within the Public identity.\nIt is left to implementation to identify the most suited approach according to the further model inputs.\nFigure 11.3-1A Information model for some IMS entities with approach A\nFigure 11.3-1B Information model for some IMS entities with approach B\nFigure 11.3-2 covers IMS Public User Identity and its relationship with other IMS data entities.\nFigure 11.3-2 Information model for IMS Public User Identity and some surrounding entities\nFigure 11.3-3 covers IMS Public Service Identity and its relationship with other IMS data entities.\nFigure 11.3-3 Information model for IMS Public Service Identity and some surrounding entities\nFigure 11.3-4 covers IMS Public User Identity Implicit Registration Set and its relationship with Alias Group, and IMS Public User Identity.\nNOTE:\tAlias Group is used as a simplification of the 3GPP TS 23.228 defined term Alias Public User Identities. In 3GPP TS 23.228 this is referred sometimes as well as Alias Public User Identity Group or Alias Public User Identity Set.\nFollowing constrains apply:\n-\tAll Public User Identities of an Implicit Registration set must be associated to the same Private User Identities.\n-\tEach IMPU can only be included in one Alias Group\nFigure 11.3-4 Information model for IMS Public User Identity Implicit Registration Set and its relationship with IMS Public User Identity and Alias Group\nFigure 11.3-5 covers IMS Data and its relationship with Public Identity that provides coherence between approach A and approach B, since IMPU and PSI are derived entities from the more generic Public Identity\nThe figure implies that a Public Identity can not exist without IMS Data. On the other hand, IMS Data is defined for IMPU(s) or PSI(s), but not for both at the same time.\nFigure 11.3-5 Information model for Public Identity\nFigure 11.3-6 covers IMS Alias Group information model.\nFigure 11.3-6 Information model for Alias Group",

      "content": "The present study, although focused on IMS data model and not fully completed, has shown that different alternatives for UDC Service Profile (section 7) and UDC IMS Service Data (section 12) are supported in current deployments and implementations and that a common base could not be found. This is mainly due to the fact that existing FE application logics may be impacted when changing the data model and this has been evaluated as not acceptable during the work.\nFor the above reasons a standardized Reference Data Model (RDM) for the Ud interface between Front-Ends for the HSS application (HSS-FEs) and the User Data Repository (UDR) is not agreeable.\nIt is therefore recommended not to start normative specification work on the definition of a Reference Data Model.\nIt is further recommended to add text to 3GPP TS 29.335 indicating that specifying a standardized RDM is out of scope of 3GPP specifications and hence Ud data model is proprietary.\nFor multivendor interoperability between FEs and UDR specific integration projects are needed in order to accommodate data required by different vendors FEs into UDR. To this end the present document may represent a valid example of data models implementation in operator's network.\nAnnex A:Change history\nChange history\nDate\nMeeting\nTDoc\nCR\nRev\nCat\nSubject/Comment\nNew version\n2012-09\nCT#57\nCP-120484\nPresented for approval\n11.0.0\n2014-09\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-12 version (MCC)\n12.0.0\n2015-12\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-13 version (MCC)\n13.0.0\n2017-03\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-14 version (MCC)\n14.0.0\n2018-10\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-15 version (MCC)\n15.0.0\n2020-07\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-16 version (MCC)\n16.0.0\n2022-04\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-17 version (MCC)\n17.0.0\n2024-03\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nUpdate to Rel-18 version (MCC)\n18.0.0",
