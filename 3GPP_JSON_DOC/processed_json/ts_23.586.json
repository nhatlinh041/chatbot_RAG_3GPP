      "content": "Either UE-only Operation or Network-based Operation is applied in the Ranging/Sidelink Positioning control procedures.\nUE-only Operation as specified in this clause is applied for the following cases:\n-\tNeither Target UE nor SL Reference UE is served by NG-RAN.\n-\tNetwork-based Operation is not supported by the 5GC network as described in clause 5.2.3.\n-\tResponse to SL-MO-LR request allows the UE only operation for a period of time by the network due to congestion.\nFor any other cases, Network-based Operation as specified in clauses 6.20 of TS 23.273 [8] is applied.\nFigure 6.8.1-1: Procedures for Ranging/Sidelink Positioning control (UE-only operation)\n1.\tUE1 (i.e. Target UE) may receive a Ranging/SL Positioning Service request from:\n1a.\tSL Positioning Client UE over PC5 during procedures for Ranging/SL Positioning service exposure through PC5 as defined in clause 6.7.1.1.\nFor absolute location, the service request includes the SL Positioning Client UE's user info and Target UE's user info, and required positioning QoS and may also include the user info for a list of candidate Located UE(s).\nFor relative location or ranging information, the service request includes the SL Positioning Client UE's user info, Target UE's user info, SL Reference UE's user info (UE2/.../UEn), and Ranging/SL Positioning QoS information.\n1b.\tRSPP application layer.\nThe service request includes type of the result (i.e. absolute location, relative location or ranging information) and the required QoS.\n2.\tIf exposure to SL Positioning Client UE is allowed by UE1, it discovers UE2/.../UEn (i.e. SL Reference UEs/Located UEs and optionally whether they support SL Positioning Server UE role) as defined in clause 6.4, if needed.\nNOTE 1:\tDetails of security related procedures during UE discovery are defined in clause 6.2 of TS 33.533 [13].\n3.\tIf none of UE1/.../UEn are served by NG-RAN or the serving network does not support Ranging/SL Positioning, UE-only Operation is applied.\n4.\tUE1 and UE2/.../UEn perform capability exchange using SLPP messages. Step 4 may be performed during step 7 with coordination of SL Positioning Server UE.\nBefore the step4, UE1 establishes the secure PC5 link with UE2/.../UEn.\nIn addition, if UE1 acts as SL Positioning Server, UE1 may also request for the absolute location of UE2/.../UEn from UE2/.../UEn using the supplementary RSPP signalling message, and if the absolute location is available and allowed to be shared (i.e. after privacy verification according to clause 6.3.7 of TS 33.533 [13]), the absolute location of UE2/.../UEn is transferred by UE2/.../UEn to UE1 by the supplementary RSPP signalling message; and\nUE1 selects the Located UEs (e.g. UEx/.../UEy) from UE2/.../UEn for the subsequent SL positioning/ranging operation (e.g., based on information received during discovery, Ranging/SL Positioning capability of UE1/UE2/.../UEn, the absolute location of UE2/.../UEn).\n5.\tIf UE1 does not support SL Positioning Server functionalities or UE1 opts to select a SL Positioning Server UE different from UE1, a SL Positioning Server UE (either co-located with a SL Reference UE/Located UE, or operated by a separate UE) is discovered (if not yet discovered in step 2) and selected. If a SL Positioning Server UE is co-located with a SL Reference UE/Located UE or operated by a separate UE, UE1 discovers and selects the SL Positioning Server UE as described in clauses 5.2.3 and 6.4. UE1 establishes the secure PC5 link with the selected SL Positioning Server UE.\nNOTE 2:\tUE1 may be able to perform the selection of the SL Positioning Server UE based on information obtained in step 2.\nIf the Located UE is served by NG-RAN, it may use 5GC-MO-LR procedure to retrieve its absolute location.\nNOTE 3:\tAfter step 5a and before step 5b, UE1 checks with UE2/.../UEn about whether exposure to SL Positioning Client UE and exposure to SL Positioning Server UE, if selected, are allowed based on the procedure defined in clause 6.3.7 of TS 33.533 [13]. The UEs from UE2/.../UEn may be down-selected based on the privacy check result. If UE privacy check against the SL Positioning Server UE fails, step 5a may be repeated to reselect a SL Positioning Server UE.\nNOTE 4:\tSteps 5a, 5b, 6, 7, 8a, 9, 11, 13 are performed only when SL Positioning Server UE is different from UE1.\n6.\tIf a SL Positioning server UE is selected, UE 1 sends a Ranging/SL positioning request using supplementary RSPP signalling message to the selected SL Positioning Server UE. This request indicates the other UEs 2 to n using the Application layer ID and indicates the Ranging/SL positioning result types needed (e.g. absolute locations, relative locations or distances and directions between pairs of UEs). The required QoS for Ranging/SL positioning is also indicated.\n7.\tThe SL Positioning Server UE sends requests to UE1 for capability of UE1 using the SLPP message and for the capabilities of UE2/.../UEn using the supplementary RSPP signalling (e.g. including SLPP containers that may contain Sidelink Positioning capability request for UE2/.../UEn) message with the corresponding Application Layer ID of UE2/.../UEn. UE1 responds to the SL Positioning Server UE with its own capability using SLPP message and the capabilities of UE2 to n using the supplementary RSPP signalling message (e.g. including SLPP containers that may contain Sidelink Positioning capability of UE2/.../UEn) with the corresponding Application Layer ID of UE2/.../UEn. If step 4 did not occur, UE1 retrieves capabilities from UE2/.../UEn using SLPP messages during this step.\nThe SL Positioning Server UE may downselect the UEs (e.g. UEx/.../UEy) from UE2/.../UEn for the subsequent SL positioning/ranging operation (e.g., based on UE capability).\n8.\tThe SL Positioning Server UE provides the Sidelink Positioning assistance data to UE1.\n8a.\tFor the Sidelink Positioning assistance data used by UE1, it is transmitted by SLPP message.\n8b.\tFor the Sidelink Positioning assistance data used by UEx/.../UEy, it is transmitted using the supplementary RSPP signalling messages (e.g. including SLPP containers that may contain Sidelink Positioning assistance data for UEx/.../UEy) with the corresponding Application Layer ID of UEx/.../UEy and then UE1 sends the assistance data to each UE (UEx/.../UEy) by SLPP messages.\n9.\tThe SL Positioning Server UE sends requests to UE1 for SL measurement information of UE 1 and UEx/.../UEy, if the SL Positioning Server UE performs the result calculation. For the SL measurement information of UE1, the request uses the SLPP message. For the SL measurement information of UEx/.../UEy, the request uses the supplementary RSPP signalling message (e.g. including SLPP container that may contain Sidelink Positioning location measurements request for UEx/.../UEy) with the corresponding Application Layer ID of UEx/.../UEy. In addition, the SL Positioning Server UE may also request for the absolute location of UEx/.../UEy via UE1 using the supplementary RSPP signalling message with the corresponding Application Layer ID of UEx/.../UEy. If the absolute location of UEx/.../UEy is available, then the absolute location of UEx/.../UEy is returned using a supplementary RSPP signalling message.\nNOTE 5:\tBased on implementation, when performing as a Located UE, UEx/.../UEy may locally check whether it is allowed to share its absolute location.\n10.\tIf a SL Positioning Server UE different from UE1 is selected in step 5, SL-PRS measurement is performed between UE1 and UEx/.../UEy and possibly also amongst UEx/.../UEy. The UE1 requests for the SL measurement information from UEx/.../UEy by the SLPP messages and/or the absolute locations of UEx/.../UEy from UEx/.../UEy by supplementary RSPP signalling messages if requested in step9 by SL Positioning Server UE. The SL-PRS measurement data is transferred to UE1 using SLPP messages.\n11.\tSL-PRS measurement data of UE1 is transferred by SLPP message to the SL Positioning Server UE and SL-PRS measurement data of UEx/.../UEy is transferred by UE1 using the supplementary RSPP signalling message (e.g. including SLPP container that may contain SL-PRS measurement data of UEx/.../UEy) with the corresponding Application Layer ID of UEx/.../UEy to the SL Positioning Server UE if requested in step 9 in order to perform result calculation. The absolute location of UEx/.../UEy as received in step 9 is transferred by UE1 to the SL Positioning Server UE by the supplementary RSPP signalling message with the corresponding Application Layer ID of UEx/.../UEy if requested in step9.\n12.\tBased on the result types requested in step 6, absolute location, relative location or ranging information is calculated at the SL Positioning Server UE.\nNOTE 6:\tDetails of step 4-12 are developed by RAN WGs.\nNOTE 7:\tThe supplementary RSPP signalling message mentioned above is conveyed by PC5-U and handled in the Ranging/SL Positioning layer, whose detailed design is left to stage 3.\n13.\tThe SL Positioning Server UE selected in step 5 sends a Ranging/SL positioning response using supplementary RSPP signalling message to UE1 including the result that is required in step 6.\n14.\tRanging/SL Positioning result is transferred to:\n14a.\tSL Positioning Client UE over PC5 during procedures for Ranging/SL Positioning service exposure through PC5 as defined in clause 6.7.1.1;\n14b.\tApplication layer.",
