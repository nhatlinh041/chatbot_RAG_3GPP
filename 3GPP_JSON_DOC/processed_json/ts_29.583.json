It is the PIN Server responsibility to check whether the service API consumer is authorized to use an API based on the provided \"token\". Once the PIN Server verifies the \"token\", it shall check whether the PIN Server identifier in the \"token\" matches its own published identifier, and whether the API name in the \"token\" matches its own published API name. If those checks are passed, the service API consumer has full authority to access any resource or operation provided by the invoked API.\nNOTE 2:\tFor the aforementioned security methods, the PIN Server needs to apply admission control according to access control policies after performing the authorization checks.\nAnnex A (normative):OpenAPI specification\nA.1\tGeneral\nThis Annex specifies the formal definition of the API(s) defined in the present specification.
