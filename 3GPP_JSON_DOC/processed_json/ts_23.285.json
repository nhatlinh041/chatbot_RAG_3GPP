These two operation modes may be used by a UE independently for transmission and reception, e.g. a UE can use MBMS for reception without using LTE-Uu for transmission. A UE may also receive V2X messages via LTE-Uu unicast downlink.\nFor both operation modes, the following principles apply:\n-\tV2X Application Servers e.g. in different domains can communicate with each other for the exchange of V2X messages. The interface between V2X Application Servers and the methods of the exchange of messages between V2X Application Servers is out of scope of 3GPP.\n-\tProSe discovery feature (TS 23.303 [5] clause 5.3 ProSe Direct Discovery) is not required for V2X Services.\nNOTE:\tProSe discovery feature can be used by a V2X supporting UE, but that is up to UE implementation.\n-\tSubject to regional regulations, lawful interception requirements apply to V2X Services.\n-\tAn RSU is not an architectural entity, but an implementation option. This is achieved by collocating a V2X application logic/server with some entities of the 3GPP system, as shown in examples in Annex A.",

How such configuration is performed is out of scope of this specification.\nAnnex A (informative):Road Side Unit (RSU) implementation options\nThis Annex presents examples how RSU can be implemented. With reference to the architectural reference models defined in clause 4.2, the RSU can receive V2X messages via SGi, PC5 or LTE-Uu interface depending on implementation option.\nFigure A-1 shows a UE-type RSU, which combines a UE with the V2X application logic.\nFigure A-1: RSU includes a UE and the V2X application logic\nFigure A-2 shows one example of eNB-type RSUs. In this example, the RSU comprises an eNB, a collocated L-GW, and a V2X Application Server.\nFigure A-2: RSU includes an eNB, L-GW and a V2X Application Server\nAnnex B (informative):Localized MBMS deployment options\nB.1\tGeneral Description\nIn current MBMS system, the BM-SC, MBMS-GW and MME are located in the Core Network. The backhaul delay between the BM-SC and the eNB is non-negligible when calculating the end-to-end delay, especially when MBMS is used to delivery downlink V2X messages in the V2X system. To minimize the latency, possible deployment can consider the following options:\n-\tTo move the MBMS CN functions (e.g. BM-SC, MBMS-GW) closer to the eNB.\n-\tTo move the user plane of MBMS CN functions (BM-SC, MBMS-GW) closer to the eNB.\nThese options are illustrated in clause B.2 and clause B.3. The list of deployment options is not exhaustive and that they are shown for illustration purposes only.\nIf the V2X Application Server utilizes xMB interface, the options B.2 and B.3 replace MB2-C and MB2-U with xMB-C and xMB-U respectively.\nB.2\tOption of localized MBMS CN functions\nIn this case BM-SC, and MBMS-GW are located close to the eNB. This option is shown in Figure B.2-1.\nFigure B.2-1: Localized MBMS CN functions\nB.3\tOption of localized user plane of MBMS CN functions\nIn this case user plane of MBMS CN functions (BM-SC and MBMS-GW) is located close to the eNB. This option is shown in Figure B.3-1.\nFigure B.3-1: Localized user plane of MBMS CN functions\nThe user plane of MBMS CN functions can implement the following user plane functionalities:\n-\tReceive user data from V2X Application Server over MB2-U.\n-\tIP multicast distribution of MBMS user plane data to E-UTRAN (M1 reference point).\n-\tData synchronization (as for the BM-SC in legacy MBMS mechanisms).\n-\tIf used, apply favourable error resilient schemes, e.g. specialized MBMS codecs or Forward Error Correction schemes.\n-\tIf used, MBMS data encryption.\nThe procedure for Local MBMS based MBMS data delivery described in clause 5.4.2.2 makes this type of deployment option possible to improve V2X latency.\nThe separation of control and user plane functions in this option is for illustration only.\nAnnex C (informative):Example hybrid operation modes for V2X communication over PC5 and LTE-Uu\nC.1\tGeneral\nThis Annex presents examples on how two operation modes for V2X communication, i.e. over the PC5 and over LTE-Uu, can be used in a hybrid manner.\nC.2\tPC5 based V2X communication with MBMS reception\nIn this operation mode, a UE always transmits the V2X messages via PC5. The UE receives V2X messages via PC5 and via MBMS as well.\nA stationary infrastructure entity acting as a UE, e.g. an RSU, receives V2X messages via PC5, and forwards the application layer processed V2X messages to a V2X Application Server via V1 interface, e.g. using a PDN connection over LTE-Uu or other type of connection (for example fixed). The V2X messages processed by the V2X Application Server can be distributed to UEs via the MBMS system as required.\nIn this manner, a UE can directly receive V2V messages from other UEs in close proximity. Additionally, in this operation mode, the mobile network provides information from an extended range and satisfies the needs of soft safety (e.g. situational awareness at range) or enables more advanced driving assistance applications. This combined sources of information are especially useful in high density use cases, where the UE may not be able to reliably receive V2X messages directly from distant UEs over PC5.\nC.3\tSimultaneous LTE-Uu based and PC5 based V2X communication without MBMS\nIn this operation mode, UEs communicate with other UEs that are in proximity, including with UE-type RSUs, via PC5 for both the transmission and reception of V2X messages. The UE-type RSUs can communicate with the V2X Application Servers in the mobile network, e.g. over LTE-Uu, as needed, for managing the communication of V2X messages beyond the direct PC5 communication range. With such hybrid use of PC5 and LTE-Uu based V2X communication, MBMS broadcast on the downlink is not needed.\nFigure C.3-1: V2X message transmission and reception using UE-type RSU via LTE-Uu and PC5\nFigure C.3-1 is a high level illustration of this operation mode. This operation mode consists of three components:\n•\tStationary infrastructure entities acting as UEs, e.g. UE-type RSUs, are deployed to provide adequate coverage to vehicular traffic infrastructure. The UEs and the UE-type RSUs are configured or provisioned with information for V2X communication over PC5 as specified in clause 4.4.1. The UE-type RSUs may communicate with the V2X Application Servers.\n•\tThe UE-type RSUs receive V2X messages from other UEs via PC5. The V2X application of the RSU(s) decides if the messages need to be routed to the V2X Application Server(s) over LTE-Uu connection, e.g. when the target area is larger than its V2X communication range over PC5. The V2X Application Server(s) determines the target area and the size of the area where the V2X messages need to be distributed. The V2X Application Server may coordinate and communicate with other V2X Application Servers for the determination of the target area and distribution of V2X messages in the target area.\n•\tV2X Application Server(s) send V2X messages downlink to the RSUs in the target distribution area, e.g. over LTE-Uu. The RSUs broadcast the received V2X messages using V2X communication over PC5. UEs within the region receive the RSU broadcasted V2X messages over PC5.\nIn this manner, a UE, e.g. vehicle UE only needs to operate in the operation mode of V2X communication over PC5, for V2V/V2P services. Only the UEs implemented as RSUs operate in the hybrid mode of simultaneous V2X communication over PC5 and LTE-Uu. Such combination of PC5 based and LTE-Uu based V2X communications is also useful in use cases where the UE may not be able to receive V2X messages directly from distant UEs via PC5. In addition, the UE-type RSUs can use SIPTO connection for the communication with local V2X Servers to reduce latency.\nAnnex D (informative):V2X Message Distribution Server deployment option\nD.1\tGeneral Description\nIn the case of non-session based V2X services (i.e. Road Status Notification), it is possible that a single V2X message needs to be delivered to multiple locally relevant V2X Application Servers. In order to provide network support for the distribution of these V2X messages to multiple V2X Application Servers, a possible deployment option includes a V2X Message Distribution Server behind the L/PGW as illustrated in Figure D.1-1. It is configured to distinguish whether a V2X message needs to be delivered to multiple V2X Application Servers and send them accordingly.\nUEs discover and send V2X messages to these network deployed distribution servers in the same way as to V2X Application Servers. From the UE perspective, it is communicating with a V2X Application Server and is not aware whether any of the V2X messages are further distributed onward to other servers.\nNOTE:\tThe V2X Message Distribution Server is used for illustrative purpose and not further described in any 3GPP specification.\nFigure D.1-1: V2X message distribution server deployment option\nAnnex E (informative):Change history\nChange history\nDate\nMeeting\nTDoc\nCR\nRev\nCat\nSubject/Comment\nNew version\n2016-09\nSP-73\nSP-160663\n-\n-\n-\nEditorial clean up for presentation to TSG SA#73 for information.
