      "content": "This specification describes how a GCS Application Server (GCS AS) may use the enablers offered by the 3GPP system for providing a Group Communication Service (GCS). These enablers are denoted as Group Communication System Enablers (GCSE).\nThe GCS AS uses EPS bearer services and may use in addition MBMS bearer services for transferring application signalling and data between the GCS AS and the UEs. In uplink direction, the UE uses an EPS bearer service to exchange application signalling with the GCS AS or when it wants to send data to the GCS AS. In downlink direction the GCS AS may transfer application signalling and data via the UE individual EPS bearer services and/or via MBMS bearer service. The GCS UEs register with their GCS AS using application signalling for participating in one or multiple GCS groups.\nNOTE 1:\tGCS application signalling (e.g. for group admission and floor control) and GCS group management aspects (such as group creation, deletion, modification, group membership control, etc) are out of scope of this specification.\nWhen an MBMS bearer service is used, its broadcast service area may be pre-configured for use by the GCS AS. Alternatively, the GCS AS may dynamically decide to use an MBMS bearer service when it determines that the number of UE for a GCS group is sufficiently large within an area (e.g. within a cell or a collection of cells).\nWhen MBMS bearer service is used, GCS AS may transfer data from different GCS groups over a single MBMS broadcast bearer. The application signalling and data transferred via MBMS bearer(s) are transparent to BM-SC and the MBMS bearer service. The GCS AS provides the UEs via GCS application signalling with all configuration information that the UE needs to receive application data via MBMS bearer services and to handle that data appropriately.\nWhen a GCS UE moves between areas where its MBMS broadcast bearers are available or not, the UE informs the GCS AS via application signalling that it changes from MBMS broadcast bearer reception to non-reception, or vice versa, the GCS AS activates or deactivates the downlink application signalling and data transfer via the UE individual EPS bearer(s) as appropriate. To accomplish service continuity, a UE may temporarily receive the same GCS application signalling and data in parallel via EPS bearer(s) and MBMS service(s). The GCS UE application discards any received application signalling or data duplicates.\nThe following diagram shows an example of a scenario where a combination of Unicast and MBMS Delivery is used for a particular media, belonging to a single group, by the GCS AS on the DL to different UEs. Here, UE-1 and UE-2 receive DL traffic over unicast whereas UEs 3-6 receive DL traffic over MBMS.\nNOTE 2:\tEven though UE-2, UE-3 and UE-4 are connected to the same eNB (eNB-2), the UEs may be using different delivery modes. For example, UE-2 is using unicast since it may be in an area where the MBMS signal strength is weak.\nFigure 4.1-1: Media traffic with unicast and MBMS on DL\nNOTE 3:\tDuring service continuity procedures a UE may simultaneously receive traffic from both unicast and MBMS.",

      "content": "This model assumes that the GCS AS is not associated with any PLMN (regardless of the subscription of the UEs that use it). The GCS AS is merely perceived as a third party application server by each serving PLMN. In addition:\n-\tWhen the group communication service is provided using Unicast Delivery, there are no additional requirements in order to provide GCS in roaming other than enabling normal EPS roaming and the ability of the GCS AS to access QoS control capabilities via Rx interface in the HPLMN (for the non-roaming case and the roaming Home routed case). For the Local breakout scenario, QoS control may be established via hPCRF and the S9 interface towards the vPCRF directly to the vPCRF as specified in TS 23.203 [6]. The GCS AS shall provide information to enable session binding as defined in clause 6.1.1.2 of TS 23.203 [6].\n-\tWhen MBMS Delivery to particular regions of the serving PLMN is required, the GCS AS needs to have access to an MB2 interface offered by the serving PLMN.\nSince the GCS AS is a third party application server, the GCS AS can access the required network resources to deliver the group communication service, whether the serving PLMN is the Home PLMN or a different VPLMN, based on operator agreement.\nThe PLMN selection process is according to the existing 3GPP procedures. When a PLMN is selected, the UE should, in order to enable group communication services, register or re-register with the GCS AS and report to it the PLMN ID of the current serving network as well as its HPLMN ID. The GCS AS may then, based on this information, determine if it has an MB2 connection agreement for the serving PLMN, and if so report to the UE the MBMS related service data required to use the service via MBMS Delivery in that PLMN.\nBoth the Home and serving PLMN ID(s) are needed to identify the contact point for the Rx interface, in addition to existing parameters as defined in TS 23.203 [6] in order to accurately identify the UE and the session. The GCS AS finds the entry point at the HPLMN using the home PLMN ID, the GCS AS finds the entry point at the VPLMN using the serving PLMN ID. Within the PLMN, the information listed in TS 23.203 [6] is used to find the PCRF.\nIf no MB2 connection agreement with the GCS AS is available in the serving PLMN, then the GCS AS may deliver the group communication data using Unicast Delivery.\nNOTE:\tIn the architecture figures shown in clauses 4.2.2, 4.2.3 and 4.2.4, \"GCS AS\" is being shown as one entity for simplicity. It may be comprised of different functional entities to handle user and control plane. A BM-SC may be connected to multiple GCS AS, and a UE may be served simultaneously by multiple GCS AS (via separate GC1 connections).\nThe GCS AS provides the Service Information to the PCRF and the BM-SC. The Service Information is mapped by the PCRF and the BM-SC to the QoS parameters under the consideration of the respective EPS network.",

The EPS bearer services are specified in TS 23.401 [5] and TS 23.203 [6].\nIn order to enable GCS, a PDN connection needs to be established that can be used for GC1 signalling  exchange. When the PDN connection gets established the PCC functionality determines a QCI and an ARP for the default bearer, which may be used for GC1 signalling . Alternatively, during PDN connection establishment a dedicated bearer may be established for GC1 signalling  by configuring PCC rules accordingly.\nA GCS UE may join multiple GCS groups, which are served by one or more EPS bearers. The GCS AS determines the service characteristics of a specific Group Communication Service, e.g. media or flow description and priority, which is used by the PCRF to determine the EPS bearer configuration appropriate for GCS. The GCS AS updates the PCRF with service characteristics to initiate any required update of the EPS bearer configuration, e.g. when the UE joins or leaves a GCS group or when a GCS data exchange starts or stops.\nWhenever the UE's bearer configuration needs to be updated, the GCS AS provides the updated or new service characteristics to the PCRF. From service characteristics PCRF determines the required bearer configuration, including QCI and ARP, and requests the PCEF amendment of the UE's EPS bearers accordingly. If the priority of the application Group Communication session changes, the GCS AS provides an update of the service characteristics towards the PCRF via the Rx interface. The PCRF translates the service characteristics to PCC policies and forwards its policy decision to the PCEF. The PCEF determines, based on policies provided by the PCRF, whether the PCEF modifies already established bearers or whether the PCEF establishes dedicated bearer(s) with the determined bearer characteristics.\nThe PCRF is not aware of the GCS group(s).\nTo obtain the responsiveness desired for GCS the GCS UE shall signal the Idle Mode DRX value to the MME, using the procedures described in TS 23.401 [5]. The E-UTRAN derives from the QCI the configuration for delivering an equivalent responsiveness in Connected Mode. When performing the S1 interface paging procedure for a DownlinkData Notification for a bearer associated with either QCI 65 or QCI 69 (e.g. Mission Critical Push To Talk), the Paging Priority IE needs to be set to a value such that the E-UTRAN can correctly prioritize the contents of its radio interface paging messages to enable low latency for the first downlink packet on that bearer. To enable the MME to send this Paging Priority IE on the S1 interface, the bearer(s) associated with QCI 65 and QCI 69 should have appropriate ARP(s).",

      "content": "A Group Communication Session that requires to be prioritized over other Group Communication Sessions or non-Group Communication Sessions includes both the priority level and the GCS identifier in a service authorization request to the PCRF and to the BM-SC.\nThe priority level and the GCS identifier are defined at the application layer for priority and pre-emption purposes. The GCS AS provides the priority level and the GCS identifier to the PCRF and the BM-SC. It is mapped by the PCRF and the BM-SC to the ARP priority level, pre-emption capability and pre-emption vulnerability indication under the consideration of the respective EPS network.\nIn the case of Unicast Delivery, the PCRF translates the service characteristics to PCC policies and forwards its policy decision to the PCEF. The PCEF determines, based on policies provided by the PCRF, whether the PCEF modifies already established bearers or whether the PCEF establishes dedicated bearer(s) with the determined bearer characteristics. If the priority of a particular application Group Communication session changes, the GCS AS provides an update of the service characteristics towards the PCRF via the Rx interface. The PCRF updates the PCC policies and forwards them to the PCEF. The PCEF modifies already established bearers or establishes dedicated bearer(s) accordingly.\nThe PCRF shall, at the reception of service authorization from the GCS AS including an indication that is a prioritized GC Session and priority level, ensure that the ARP priority level of the default bearer is assigned a prioritized value which is at least as high as the highest priority of all Group Communication Sessions within the same IP-CAN session. The PCRF shall also ensure that the ARP pre-emption capability and pre-emption vulnerability indication of the default bearer satisfies the strongest requirements of all Group Communication Sessions within the same IP-CAN session.\nWhen the PCRF detects that all prioritized Group Communication Sessions within the same IP-CAN session are released, the PCRF shall assign the ARP of the default bearer as appropriate.\nIn the case of MBMS Delivery, if the priority of an MBMS bearer needs to be changed, based upon a GCS AS decision to change the priority level, the GCS AS performs either:\n-\tThe Modify MBMS Bearer procedure in clause 5.1.2.4; or\n-\tA new Activate MBMS Bearer procedure and a Deactivate MBMS Bearer procedure replacing the old MBMS bearer service with a new one.\nIn certain network conditions such as congestion, the bearer used for group communication service may be pre-empted.\n-\tIn the case of Unicast Delivery, the GCS AS is notified by the PCRF of unicast bearer release.\n-\tIn the case of MBMS Delivery, the related MBMS bearer may be 'suspended' by E-UTRAN and the UE becomes aware in either of the following ways:\n-\tpackets are dropped at the eNB. In this case the UE can detect that MBMS delivery is no longer available when the related TMGI is removed from MCCH.\n-\tThe UE receives an explicit indication broadcast from the eNB in the MBMS Scheduling Information (see TS 36.300 [9] and TS 36.321 [10]), where it is informed that transmission for the MBMS bearer is going to be, or has been, suspended.\nThe procedure used by the UE in these scenarios is depicted in figure 5.4-1.\nFigure 5.4-1: Switching from MBMS Delivery to Unicast Delivery following bearer suspension (and subsequent resumption of MBMS delivery)\n1.\tThe UE has an ongoing group communication.\n2.\tThe UE is receiving downlink data by MBMS Delivery.\n3.\tE-UTRAN (e.g. after detecting MBMS congestion) decides to suspend one or more MBMS bearer(s) within MBSFN area(s) (based on e.g. the ARP and/or on the counting results for the corresponding MBMS service(s)), and trigger the migration of impacted UEs to receive DL data via unicast, by either:\na)\texplicitly informing those UEs that the MBMS bearer has been, or is going to be, suspended by broadcasting an indication within MAC MBMS Scheduling Information (and removing the TMGI from the MCCH), or\nb)\tremoving the TMGI of the MBMS bearer that has been suspended from the MCCH.\n4.\tThe UE detects the suspension of the corresponding MBMS bearer service, but continues to monitor for MBMS Delivery (i.e. because while it is establishing unicast there may still be DL data sent on the MBMS bearer).\n5.\tOver GC1, the UE notifies the GCS AS of the MBMS service suspension.\n6.\tThe GCS AS decides whether to set up the Unicast Delivery path for the downlink data to this UE.\n7.\tThe UE receives DL data by Unicast Delivery and continues to monitor MBMS channels for resumption of the MBMS bearer.\nNOTE:\tBetween step 2 and step 11 data associated with the suspended MBMS bearer continues to be delivered by the GCS AS on the corresponding multicast transport infrastructure towards the E-UTRAN (e.g. because it is still delivered via eMBMS in non-congested MBSFN areas). This also allows a quicker resumption of the MBMS service when congestion is over.\n8.\tAt some point, the RAN determines that it can resume the MBMS bearer within the MBSFN area(s), e.g. when the congestion is over. The decision which of the suspended MBMS bearers to resume may be based on e.g. the ARP and/or on the counting results for the corresponding MBMS service(s).\n9.\tThe MCCH indicates that the TMGI is available.\n10.\tThe UE detects the TMGI on the MCCH and prepares to receive it.\n11.\tThe UE is again receiving downlink data by MBMS Delivery.\n12.\tThe UE notifies the GCS AS that it is receiving the group content via MBMS.\n13.\tGCS AS stops the delivery via unicast.",

When a UE originates a request for group communication for one of these areas, the pre-established MBMS bearer(s) is used for the DL traffic.\nFigure A.2.2-1: Use of Pre-established MBMS Bearers\n1.\tThe GCS AS pre-establishes the MBMS bearers for the group communication session according to the procedures defined in clause 5.1.2.3.1.

When the GCS AS decides to use an MBMS bearer for the DL data, the GCS AS establishes one using the procedures defined in clause 5.1.2.3.1. The GCS AS provides the service description associated with MBMS bearer(s), obtained from the BM-SC, to the UE. The UE starts using the MBMS bearer(s) to receive DL data and stops using the unicast bearer for the DL data.\nNOTE:\tThe GCS AS logic for determining when to establish the new MBMS Delivery bearer is implementation specific. For example, the GCS AS could decide to establish the MBMS delivery based on the location of the UE's that are a part of the group communication session.\nFigure A.2.3-1: Use of Dynamic MBMS Bearer Establishment\n1.\tThe UE establishes a group communication session with the GCS AS.\n2.\tThe downlink data is sent by Unicast Delivery.\n3.\tThe GCS AS establishes the MBMS bearer(s) for the group communication session according to the procedures defined in clause 5.1.2.3.1.
