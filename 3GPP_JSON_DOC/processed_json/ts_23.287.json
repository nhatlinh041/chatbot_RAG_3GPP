Figure 5.2.1.4-1 illustrates an example of PC5 unicast links.\nFigure 5.2.1.4-1: Example of PC5 Unicast Links\nThe following principles apply when the V2X communication is carried over PC5 unicast link:\n-\tA PC5 unicast link between two UEs allows V2X communication between one or more pairs of peer V2X services in these UEs. All V2X services in the UE using the same PC5 unicast link use the same Application Layer ID.\nNOTE 1:\tAn Application Layer ID can change in time as described in clauses 5.6.1.1 and 6.3.3.2, due to privacy. This does not cause a re-establishment of a PC5 unicast link. The UE triggers a Link Identifier Update procedure as specified in clause 6.3.3.2.\n-\tOne PC5 unicast link supports one or more V2X service types) if these V2X service types are at least associated with the pair of peer Application Layer IDs for this PC5 unicast link. For example, as illustrated in Figure 5.2.1.4-1, UE A and UE B have two PC5 unicast links, one between peer Application Layer ID 1/UE A and Application Layer ID 2/UE B and one between peer Application Layer ID 3/UE A and Application Layer ID 4/UE B.\nNOTE 2:\tA source UE is not required to know whether different target Application Layer IDs over different PC5 unicast links belong to the same target UE.\n-\tA PC5 unicast link supports V2X communication using a single network layer protocol e.g. IP or non-IP.\n-\tA PC5 unicast link supports per-flow QoS model as specified in clause 5.4.1.\n-\tIf multiple V2X service types use a PC5 unicast link, one PC5 QoS Flow identified by PFI may be associated with more than one V2X service types.\nWhen the Application layer in the UE initiates data transfer for a V2X service type which requires unicast mode of communication over PC5 reference point:\n-\tthe UE shall reuse an existing PC5 unicast link if the pair of peer Application Layer IDs and the network layer protocol of this PC5 unicast link are identical to those required by the application layer in the UE for this V2X service, and modify the existing PC5 unicast link to add this V2X service type as specified in clause 6.3.3.4; otherwise\n-\tthe UE shall trigger the establishment of a new PC5 unicast link as specified in clause 6.3.3.1.\nAfter successful PC5 unicast link establishment, UE A and UE B use the same pair of Layer-2 IDs for subsequent PC5-S signalling message exchange and V2X service data transmission as specified in clause 5.6.1.4. The V2X layer of the transmitting UE indicates to the AS layer whether a transmission is for a PC5-S signalling message (i.e. Direct Communication Request/Accept, Link Identifier Update Request/Response/Ack, Disconnect Request/Response, Link Modification Request/Accept, Keep-alive/Ack) or V2X service data.\nFor every PC5 unicast link, a UE self-assigns a distinct PC5 Link Identifier that uniquely identifies the PC5 unicast link in the UE for the lifetime of the PC5 unicast link. Each PC5 unicast link is associated with a Unicast Link Profile which includes:\n-\tApplication Layer ID and Layer-2 ID of UE A; and\n-\tApplication Layer ID and Layer-2 ID of UE B; and\n-\tnetwork layer protocol used on the PC5 unicast link; and\n-\tthe information about PC5 QoS Flow(s). For each PC5 QoS Flow, the PC5 QoS Context and the PC5 QoS Rule(s) as defined in clause 5.4.1.1.3.\nFor privacy reason, the Application Layer IDs and Layer-2 IDs may change as described in clauses 5.6.1.1 and 6.3.3.2 during the lifetime of the PC5 unicast link and, if so, shall be updated in the Unicast Link Profile accordingly. The UE uses PC5 Link Identifier to indicate the PC5 unicast link to V2X Application layer, therefore V2X Application layer identifies the corresponding PC5 unicast link even if there are more than one unicast link associated with one V2X service type (e.g. the UE establishes multiple unicast links with multiple UEs for a same V2X service type).\nThe Unicast Link Profile shall be updated accordingly after a Layer-2 link modification for an established PC5 unicast link as specified in clause 6.3.3.4 or Layer-2 link identifier update as specified in clause 6.3.3.2.\nUpon receiving an indication from the AS layer that the PC5-RRC connection was released due to RLF, the V2X layer in the UE locally releases the PC5 unicast link associated with this PC5-RRC connection. The AS layer uses PC5 Link Identifier to indicate to the V2X layer the PC5 unicast link whose PC5-RRC connection was released.\nWhen the PC5 unicast link has been released as specified in clause 6.3.3.3, the V2X layer of each UE for the PC5 unicast link informs the AS layer that the PC5 unicast link has been released. The V2X layer uses PC5 Link Identifier to indicate the released unicast link.\nWhen the V2X layer determines that no radio frequency is available for any PC5 QoS Flow(s) over a PC5 unicast link based on indication about radio frequency failure from the AS layer, the V2X layer removes the PC5 QoS Flow(s) from the PC5 unicast link by performing Layer-2 link modification procedure as specified in clause 6.3.3.4. The AS layer uses PC5 Link Identifier to indicate to the V2X layer the PC5 unicast link whose radio frequency has failed for the PC5 QoS Flow(s).",

For the V2X communication over NR based PC5 reference point, a PC5 QoS Flow is associated with a PC5 QoS Rule and the PC5 QoS parameters as defined in clause 5.4.2. A set of standardized PC5 5QIs (PQI) are defined in clause 5.4.4. The UE may be configured with a set of default PC5 QoS parameters to use for the V2X service types, as defined in clause 5.1.2.1. For NR based unicast, groupcast and broadcast mode communication over PC5, Per-flow QoS model for PC5 QoS management shall be applied.

Depending on the type of PC5 reference point, i.e. LTE based or NR based, selected for the transmission, the UE may map the application layer provided V2X Application Requirements to the suitable QoS parameters to be passed to the lower layer. The mapping between the two QoS models is defined in clause 5.4.2. For V2X communication over NR based PC5, different V2X packets may require different QoS treatments. In that case, the V2X packets shall be sent from the V2X layer to the Access Stratum layer within PC5 QoS Flows identified by different PFIs.\n-\tWhen groupcast mode of V2X communication over NR based PC5 is used, a Range parameter is associated with the QoS parameters for the V2X communication. The Range may be provided by V2X application layer or use a default value mapped from the V2X service type based on configuration as defined in clause 5.1.2.1. The Range indicates the minimum distance that the QoS parameters need to be fulfilled. The Range parameter is passed to AS layer together with the QoS parameters for dynamic control.\n-\tNR based PC5 supports three communication modes, i.e. broadcast, groupcast, and unicast. The QoS handling of these different modes are described in clauses 5.4.1.2 to 5.4.1.4.\n-\tThe UE may handle traffic using broadcast, groupcast, and unicast mode communication by taking all their priorities, e.g. indicated by PQIs, into account as described in clause 5.4.3.3.\n-\tFor broadcast and groupcast modes of V2X communication over NR based PC5, standardized PQI values are applied by the UE, as there is no signalling over PC5 reference point for these cases.\n-\tWhen network scheduled operation mode is used, the UE-PC5-AMBR for NR based PC5 applies to all types of communication modes, and is used by NG-RAN for capping the UE's NR based PC5 transmission in the resources management.

      "content": "For NR based unicast, groupcast and broadcast mode communication over PC5 reference point, PC5 DRX operations are supported to enable pedestrian UE power saving.\nThe V2X layer determines the respective V2X service types, and derives the corresponding PC5 QoS parameters based on either the mapping of V2X service types to PC5 QoS parameters, or the V2X Application Requirements for the V2X service type provided by the application layer. The V2X layer passes the PC5 QoS parameters and destination Layer-2 ID to the AS layer as specified in clauses 6.3.1, 6.3.2 and 6.3.3. When the V2X layer derives new PC5 QoS parameters for a destination Layer-2 ID that has been provided to the AS layer, i.e. due to changes of V2X service types or V2X Application Requirements, the V2X layer provides the new PC5 QoS parameters for the destination Layer-2 ID to the AS layer.\nNOTE 1:\tFor broadcast and groupcast, the AS layer needs PC5 QoS parameters as well to determine the PC5 DRX parameter values for reception operation over PC5 reference point. Therefore, the V2X layer determines the interested V2X service types and derives the PC5 QoS parameters based on its reception needs besides the transmission needs. How to derive the PC5 QoS parameters based on its reception needs (e.g. without establishing the PC5 QoS Flows) depends on UE implementation.\nNOTE 2:\tMore than one V2X service types can be related to the groupcast. In this case, the V2X application layer needs to provide all the V2X service types for the groupcast to the V2X layer.\nFor broadcast or groupcast, the V2X layer maintains a list of all V2X service types, i.e. activated V2X service types and/or V2X service types that the UE is interested for reception, for a given destination Layer-2 ID and determines the NR Tx Profile available to be mapped for the respective V2X service type based on the configuration described in clause 5.1.2.1. Whenever the list of the V2X service types for a given destination Layer-2 ID changes, the V2X layer updates the AS layer for the NR Tx Profiles information. The V2X layer determines whether and how to provide the NR Tx Profiles for the given destination Layer-2 ID to the AS layer as below:\n-\tIf all the V2X service types have mapped NR Tx Profiles, the V2X layer provides all the mapped NR Tx Profiles to the AS layer for the given destination Layer-2 ID, e.g. when providing other information such as the destination Layer-2 ID, PC5 QoS parameters;\n-\tIf any of the V2X service types does not have mapped NR Tx Profile, the V2X layer does not provide any NR Tx Profile to the AS layer for the given destination Layer-2 ID, e.g. when providing other information such as the destination Layer-2 ID, PC5 QoS parameters.\nFor broadcast, the mapping from destination Layer-2 ID to NR Tx Profile is configured in the NG-RAN. The NG-RAN may derive the NR Tx Profile from the destination Layer-2 ID to perform the network scheduled operation mode, alignment of Uu DRX and PC5 DRX, etc.\nSupport for PC5 DRX operations in the AS layer is specified in TS 38.300 [11].\nWhen the PC5 DRX operation is needed, e.g. based on the NR Tx Profile in case of broadcast or groupcast, the AS layer determines the PC5 DRX parameter values for V2X communication over PC5 reference point, taking into account, e.g., PC5 QoS parameters and/or destination Layer-2 ID provided by the V2X layer.\nFor unicast, two UEs may negotiate the PC5 DRX configuration in the AS layer, and the PC5 DRX parameter values can be configured per pair of source and destination Layer-2 IDs and per direction in the AS layer. For transmitting and receiving Direct Communication Request messages, a default PC5 DRX configuration is used when the PC5 DRX operation is needed, e.g. based on the NR Tx Profile as specified in clause 5.1.2.1.\nFor broadcast and groupcast when the UE is \"not served by E-UTRA\" and \"not served by NR\", the UE uses the provisioned PC5 DRX configuration for PC5 DRX operation as specified in clause 5.1.2.1.",

      "content": "Figure 6.4.1-1 depicts a procedure for notification on QoS Sustainability Analytics to the V2X Application Server.\nFigure 6.4.1-1: Notification on QoS Sustainability Analytics to the V2X Application Server\n1.\tThe V2X Application Sever derives information on V2X service, location information (an area or path of interest), QoS requirements and reporting threshold(s). The location information can be in the form of geographic coordinates to reflect a list of waypoints.\nNOTE 1:\tStep 1 is outside 3GPP scope. The V2X Application Server can derive this, for example, based on information provided by the UE(s) or the V2X Application Server uses locally configured information.\n2.\tThe V2X Application Server subscribes to or requests notification on QoS Sustainability Analytics provided by NWDAF via NEF by invoking Nnef_AnalyticsExposure_Subscribe service operation as defined in clause 6.1.1.2 of TS 23.288 [20] or Nnef_AnalyticsExposure_Fetch service operation as defined in clause 6.1.2.2 of TS 23.288 [20]. The parameters included in the request are described in clause 5.4.5.2.2.\nThe V2X Application Server may include multiple sets of parameters in order to provide different combinations of \"Location information\" and \"Analytics Target Period\" when requesting notification on QoS Sustainability Analytics.\nNOTE 2:\tThe V2X Application Server needs to set the \"Time when analytics information is needed\" parameter (see TS 23.288 [20]) appropriately, e.g. large enough, to perform the V2X application adjustment before the potential QoS change happens.\nNOTE 3:\tThe request made by the V2X Application Server does not have to be per UE. In order to make a request for multiple UEs, the V2X Application Server can perform mapping between individual UE path requests and subscription to notification per path/road segment. Whether a request is generated for a UE or multiple UEs, and how to set the parameters included in the request and triggers for such request are up to the V2X Application Server implementation and outside of the scope of 3GPP.\n3.\tWhen the NEF receives the request from the V2X Application Server, the NEF interacts with the NWDAF as described in the procedure in clause 6.9.4 of TS 23.288 [20]. The NEF shall map the QoS Characteristics attributes including Resource Type, PDB and PER received from the V2X Application Server to the most appropriate 5QI that is supported by the network if the V2X application server does not provide 5QI. If 5QI is provided by the V2X Application Server, NEF does not perform such mapping. The NEF may map other parameters included in the request from the V2X Application Server to information used by the 3GPP system.\n4.\tIf the NEF receives the response from the NWDAF, the NEF notifies the V2X Application Server with the analytics information on QoS Sustainability Analytics by invoking Nnef_AnalyticsExposure_Notify service operation for a Subscribe-Notify model as defined in clause 6.1.1.2 of TS 23.288 [20] or Nnef_AnalyticsExposure_Fetch service operation for a Request-Response model as defined in clause 6.1.2.2 of TS 23.288 [20].\n5.\tV2X application adjustment may take place.\nNOTE 4:\tStep 5 is outside 3GPP scope. V2X application adjustment can take place at UE and/or V2X Application Server, e.g. adjust inter-vehicle gap, change video codec parameters, etc. For the case that the V2X Application Server uses the request for multiple UEs in step 2, the V2X Application Server can perform the V2X application adjustment for every UE corresponding to the request.\nFor a Subscribe-Notify model, when the V2X Application Sever wants to cancel subscription to analytics information, it invokes the Nnef_AnalyticsExposure_Unsubscribe service operation as defined in clause 6.1.1.2 of TS 23.288 [20].",
