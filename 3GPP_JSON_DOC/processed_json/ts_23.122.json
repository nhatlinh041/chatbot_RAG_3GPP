      "content": "The present document gives an overview of the tasks undertaken by the Core network protocols of a Mobile Station (MS) when in idle mode, that is, switched on but typically not having a dedicated channel allocated. It also describes the corresponding network functions. The idle mode functions are also performed by a GPRS MS as long as no dedicated channel is allocated to the MS. The conditions when the idle mode functions are performed by an MS in the UTRA RRC connected mode states are specified in 3GPP TS 25.331 [33]. The conditions when the idle mode functions are performed by an MS in the E-UTRAN are specified in 3GPP TS 36.304 [43]. The conditions when the idle mode functions are performed by an MS in the NG-RAN are specified in 3GPP TS 36.304 [43] and 3GPP TS 38.304 [61]. The conditions when the idle mode functions are performed by an MS in the NG-RAN RRC inactive state are specified in 3GPP TS 36.331 [42] and 3GPP TS 38.331 [65].\nThe present document defines the PLMN selection for a multi mode MS that supports both 3GPP and 3GPP2 systems. The common PLMN selection logic covers also PLMNs that are available in 3GPP2 system, but the present document makes no changes on the cdma2000® signalling towards networks that are available via 3GPP2 system.\nThe present document gives procedures for using the CSG cells, whenever such use is permitted.\nThe present document gives procedures for using the CAG cells, when the MS supports CAG.\nThe present document specifies the SNPN selection.\nThis 3GPP TS outlines how the requirements of the 22 series Technical Specifications (especially 3GPP TS 22.011 [9]) on idle mode operation shall be implemented. Further details are given in 3GPP TS 24.008 [23].\nClause 2 of this 3GPP TS gives a general description of the idle mode process. Clause 3 outlines the main requirements and technical solutions of those requirements. Clause 4 describes the processes used in idle mode. There is inevitably some overlap between these clauses.\nNOTE:\tcdma2000® is a registered trademark of the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA-USA).\nThe present document describes the procedures for control plane solution of steering of roaming in 5GS in annex C.\nAnnex C is applicable to the MS, the AMF, the UDM and the SOR-AF in the 5GS.\nThe present document does not consider GERAN Iu mode.",

      "content": "For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations defined in 3GPP TR 21.905 [36] apply.\n(A/Gb mode only): Indicates this clause applies only to a GSM system which operates in A/Gb mode. For multi system case this is determined by the current serving radio access network.\n(Iu mode only): Indicates this clause applies only to UMTS. For multi system case this is determined by the current serving radio access network.\nNOTE 1:\tIn accordance with the description of packet services in Iu mode in 3GPPS TS 24.008 [23], the terms 'CS/PS mode of operation' and 'PS mode of operation' are not used in the present document. Instead the terms 'MS operation mode A' and 'MS operation mode C' are used.\n(S1 mode only): Indicates this clause applies only to an EPS. For multi system case this is determined by the current serving radio access network.\nAcceptable Cell: This is a cell that the MS may camp on to make emergency calls or to access RLOS. It must satisfy criteria which are defined for A/Gb mode in 3GPP TS 43.022 [35], for Iu mode in 3GPP TS 25.304 [32], for S1 mode in 3GPP TS 36.304 [43], and for NR access in N1 mode in 3GPP TS 38.304 [61] and for E-UTRA access in N1 mode in 3GPP TS 36.304 [43]. For an MS in eCall only mode, an acceptable cell must further satisfy the criteria defined in clause 4.4.3.1.1.\nAccess Technology: The access technology associated with a PLMN or SNPN. The MS uses this information to determine what type(s) of radio carrier to search for when attempting to select a specific PLMN or SNPN The following access technologies are defined: GSM, UTRAN, GSM COMPACT, EC-GSM-IoT, cdma2000 1xRTT, cdma2000 HRPD, E-UTRAN (WB-S1 mode and NB-S1 mode), NG-RAN, satellite NG-RAN and satellite E-UTRAN (WB-S1 mode and NB-S1 mode). A PLMN may support more than one access technology. SNPNs only support NG-RAN.\nNOTE 2:\tAccess technology \"E-UTRAN\" maps to core network type \"EPC\" and access technology \"NG-RAN\" maps to core network type \"5GCN\", see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64].\nACDC: Application specific Congestion control for Data Communication, see 3GPP TS 22.011 [9].\nAllowable PLMN: In the case of an MS operating in MS operation mode A or B, this is a PLMN which is not in the list of \"forbidden PLMNs\" in the MS. In the case of an MS operating in MS operation mode C or an MS not supporting A/Gb mode and not supporting Iu mode, this is a PLMN which is not in the list of \"forbidden PLMNs\" and not in the list of \"forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service\" in the MS.\nAllowable SNPN: In the case of an MS operating in SNPN access operation mode over 3GPP access and for an SNPN candidate which is not an SNPN selected for localized services in SNPN, this is an SNPN which is not in the list of \"permanently forbidden SNPNs\" which is, if the MS supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder, equivalent SNPNs or both, associated with the selected entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" or the selected PLMN subscription, and is not in the list of \"temporarily forbidden SNPNs\" which is, if the MS supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder, equivalent SNPNs or both, associated with the selected entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" or the selected PLMN subscription. In the case of an MS operating in SNPN access operation mode over 3GPP access and for an SNPN candidate which is an SNPN selected for localized services in SNPN, this is an SNPN which is not in the list of \"permanently forbidden SNPNs for access for localized services in SNPN\" which is associated with the selected entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" or the selected PLMN subscription, and is not in the list of \"temporarily forbidden SNPNs for access for localized services in SNPN\" which is associated with the selected entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" or the selected PLMN subscription. For onboarding services in SNPN, this is an SNPN which is not in the list of \"permanently forbidden SNPNs for onboarding services in SNPN\" and is not in the list of \"temporarily forbidden SNPNs for onboarding services in SNPN\".\nAllowable PLMN/access technology combination: For an MS operating in MS operation mode C or an MS not supporting A/Gb mode and not supporting Iu mode, this is an allowable PLMN in any specific access technology. For an MS operating in MS operation mode A or B, this is a PLMN/access technology combination where:\n-\tthe PLMN is an allowable PLMN and the specific access technology is supporting non-GPRS services; or\n-\tthe PLMN is not in the list of \"forbidden PLMNs\" and not in the list of \"forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service\" in the MS and the specific access technology is only supporting GPRS services.\nEXAMPLE:\tE-UTRAN, satellite E-UTRAN, satellite NG-RAN (see 3GPP TS 22.261 [74]) and NG-RAN are access technologies that are only supporting GPRS services.\nAvailable PLMN: For GERAN A/Gb mode see 3GPP TS 43.022 [35]. For UTRAN see 3GPP TS 25.304 [32]. For E-UTRAN see 3GPP TS 36.304 [43]. For satellite E-UTRAN see 3GPP TS 36.304 [43]. For NG-RAN see 3GPP TS 36.304 [43] and 3GPP TS 38.304 [61]. For satellite NG-RAN, see 3GPP TS 38.304 [61]. For cdma2000® 1xRTT and cdma2000® HRPD see 3GPP2 C.S0016 [44].\nAvailable SNPN: For NG-RAN see 3GPP TS 38.304 [61].\nAvailable PLMN/access technology combination: This is an available PLMN in a specific access technology.\nCAG-ID authorized based on \"Allowed CAG list\": A CAG-ID in an \"Allowed CAG list\", without a time validity information, or with a time validity information with at least one time period matching UE's current time.\nCamped on a cell: The MS (ME if there is no SIM) has completed the cell selection/reselection process and has chosen a cell from which it plans to receive all available services. Note that the services may be limited, and that the PLMN or the SNPN may not be aware of the existence of the MS (ME) within the chosen cell.\nCountry: A country is identified by a single MCC value defined in ITU-T recommendation E.212 [76], with the exception of the following MCC ranges that identify a single country:\n-\tvalues 310 through 316 (USA);\n-\tvalues 404 through 406 (India);\n-\tvalues 440 through 441 (Japan);\n-\tvalues 460 through 461 (China); and\n-\tvalues 234 through 235 (United Kingdom).\nPermitted CSG list: See 3GPP TS 36.304 [43].\nCurrent serving cell: This is the cell on which the MS is camped.\nCTS MS: An MS capable of CTS services is a CTS MS.\nDiscontinuous coverage: Deployment option for satellite E-UTRAN access, in which shorter periods of satellite E-UTRAN access radio coverage are followed by longer periods of satellite E-UTRAN access coverage gaps. During coverage gaps, the access stratum may be deactivated. For more details see 3GPP TS 23.401 [58] and 3GPP TS 36.304 [43].\nEAB: Extended Access Barring, see 3GPP TS 22.011 [9].\nExtended Coverage in GSM for Internet of Things (EC-GSM-IoT): Extended coverage in GSM for IoT is a feature which enables extended coverage operation. See 3GPP TS 43.064 [55].\nEHPLMN: Any of the PLMN entries contained in the Equivalent HPLMN list.\nEquivalent HPLMN list: To allow provision for multiple HPLMN codes, PLMN codes that are present within this list shall replace the HPLMN code derived from the IMSI for PLMN selection purposes. This list is stored on the USIM and is known as the EHPLMN list. The EHPLMN list may also contain the HPLMN code derived from the IMSI. If the HPLMN code derived from the IMSI is not present in the EHPLMN list then it shall be treated as a Visited PLMN for PLMN selection purposes.\nGeneric Access Network (GAN): See 3GPP TS 43.318 [35A].\nGAN mode: See 3GPP TS 43.318 [35A].\nGPRS MS: An MS capable of GPRS services is a GPRS MS.\nMS operation mode: See 3GPP TS 23.060 [27].\nHigh quality signal: The high quality signal limit is used in the PLMN selection procedure. It is defined in the appropriate AS specification: 3GPP TS 43.022 [35] for the GSM radio access technology, 3GPP TS 25.304 [32] for the UMTS radio access technology (FDD or TDD mode), 3GPP TS 36.304 [43] for the E‑UTRAN radio access technology (WB-S1 mode, NB-S1 mode, WB-N1 mode or NB-N1 mode), 3GPP TS 36.304 [43] and 3GPP TS 38.304 [61] for the NG-RAN radio access technology. For 3GPP2 access technologies the high quality signal limit is defined in 3GPP2 C.S0011 [45] for cdma2000® 1xRTT and in 3GPP2 C.S0033 [46] for cdma2000® HRPD. A mobile station attempting to find a cell that supports EC-GSM-IoT (see 3GPP TS 43.064 [55]) does not use high quality signal limit in the PLMN selection procedure, i.e. for the purpose of PLMN selection, when attempting to find a cell that supports EC-GSM-IoT, any found cell supporting EC-GSM-IoT is considered to be received with high quality signal. A UE attempting to find a cell that supports enhanced coverage when operating in any WB-S1 or WB-N1 enhanced coverage mode does not use high quality signal limit in the PLMN selection procedure, i.e. for the purpose of PLMN selection, when attempting to find a cell that supports enhanced coverage, any found cell supporting enhanced coverage and satisfying the coverage specific quality signal limit defined for CE mode (see 3GPP TS 36.304 [43]) is considered to be received with high quality signal.\nHome PLMN: This is a PLMN where the MCC and MNC of the PLMN identity match the MCC and MNC of the IMSI. Matching criteria are defined in Annex A.\nIn A/Gb mode: Indicates this clause applies only to a GSM system which operates in A/Gb mode. For multi system case this is determined by the current serving radio access network.\nIn Iu mode: Indicates this clause applies only to UMTS. For multi system case this is determined by the current serving radio access network.\nIn N1 mode: Indicates this clause applies only to an 5GS. For multi system case this is determined by the current serving radio access network.\nIn NB-N1 mode: Indicates this paragraph applies only to a system which operates in NB-N1 mode. For a multi-access system this case applies if the current serving radio access network provides access to 5G network services via E-UTRA connected to 5GCN by NB-IoT (see 3GPP TS 36.300 [56], 3GPP TS 36.331 [42], 3GPP TS 36.306 [54]).\nIn WB-N1 mode: Indicates this paragraph applies only to a system which operates in WB-N1 mode. For a multi-access system this case applies if the system operates in N1 mode with E-UTRA connected to 5GCN, but not in NB-N1 mode.\nIn S1 mode: Indicates this clause applies only to an EPS. The S1 mode includes WB-S1 mode and NB-S1 mode. For multi system case this is determined by the current serving radio access network.\nIn NB-S1 mode: Indicates this paragraph applies only to a system which operates in NB-S1 mode. For a multi-access system this case applies if the current serving radio access network provides access to network services via E-UTRA by NB-IoT (see 3GPP TS 36.300 [56], 3GPP TS 36.331 [22], 3GPP TS 36.306 [54]).\nIn WB-S1 mode: Indicates this paragraph applies only to a system which operates in WB-S1 mode. For a multi-access system this case applies if the system operates in S1 mode, but not in NB-S1 mode.\nLimited Service State: See clause 3.5.\nLocalised Service Area (LSA): A localised service area consists of a cell or a number of cells. The cells constituting a LSA may not necessarily provide contiguous coverage.\nLocalized services in NPN: Localized services in NPN are services, which are provided by an NPN at specific or limited area, are bounded in time, or both.\nLocalized services in SNPN: Localized services in SNPN are localized services in NPN, which are provided by an SNPN at specific or limited area, are bounded in time, or both.\nLocation Registration (LR): An MS which is IMSI attached to non-GPRS services only performs location registration by the location updating procedure. A GPRS MS which is IMSI attached to GPRS services or to GPRS and non-GPRS services performs location registration by the routing area update procedure only when in a network of network operation mode I. Both location updating and routing area update procedures are performed independently by the GPRS MS when it is IMSI attached to GPRS and non-GPRS services in a network of network operation mode II (see 3GPP TS 23.060 [27]). An MS which is attached via the E-UTRAN performs location registration by the tracking area update procedure. An MS which is registered via the NG-RAN performs location registration by the registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]).\nMINT: Minimization of service interruption (see 3GPP TS 22.261 [71]).\nMS: Mobile Station. The present document makes no distinction between MS and UE.\nN1 mode capability: Capability of the UE associated with an N1 NAS signalling connection between the UE and network. The present document refers to the N1 mode capability over 3GPP access only (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]).\nNarrowBand Internet of Things (NB-IoT): NB-IoT is a non-backward compatible variant of E-UTRAN supporting a reduced set of functionality. NB-IoT allows access to EPC or 5GCN network services via E-UTRA with a channel bandwidth limited to 180 kHz (see 3GPP TS 36.300 [20], 3GPP TS 36.331 [42], 3GPP TS 36.306 [44]).\nNetwork Type: The network type associated with HPLMN or a PLMN on the PLMN selector (see 3GPP TS 31.102 [40]). The MS uses this information to determine what type of radio carrier to search for when attempting to select a specific PLMN. A PLMN may support more than one network type.\nOnboarding services in SNPN: Onboarding services in SNPN allow an MS to access an SNPN indicating that onboarding is allowed, using default UE credentials for primary authentication in order for the MS to be configured with one or more entries of the \"list of subscriber data\".\nNOTE 3:\tWhen the MS is registered for onboarding services in SNPN, services other than the onboarding services in SNPN are not available. When the MS is not registered for onboarding services in SNPN, onboarding services in SNPN are not available.\nUE determined PLMN with disaster condition: A PLMN to which a disaster condition applies, determined as described in clause 4.4.3.1.1.\nRegistered PLMN (RPLMN): This is the PLMN on which certain LR outcomes have occurred (see table 1). In a shared network the RPLMN is the PLMN defined by the PLMN identity of the CN operator that has accepted the LR.\nRegistered SNPN (RSNPN): This is the SNPN on which certain LR outcomes have occurred.

      "content": "When an MS is switched on, it attempts to make contact with a public land mobile network (PLMN) or stand-alone non-public network (SNPN). The particular PLMN or SNPN to be contacted may be selected either automatically or manually.\nThe MS looks for a suitable cell of the chosen PLMN or SNPN and chooses that cell to provide available services, and tunes to its control channel. This choosing is known as \"camping on the cell\". The MS will then register its presence in the registration area of the chosen cell if necessary, by means of a location registration (LR), GPRS attach, IMSI attach or registration procedure.\nIf the MS loses coverage of a cell, or find a more suitable cell, it reselects onto the most suitable cell of the selected PLMN or SNPN and camps on that cell. If the new cell is in a different registration area, an LR request is performed.\nIf the MS loses coverage of a PLMN or SNPN, either a new PLMN or SNPN is selected automatically, or an indication of which PLMNs or SNPNs are available is given to the user, so that a manual selection can be made.\nRegistration is not performed by MSs only capable of services that need no registration.\nThe purpose of camping on a cell in idle mode is fourfold:\na)\tIt enables the MS to receive system information from the PLMN or SNPN.\nb)\tIf the MS wishes to initiate a call, it can do this by initially accessing the network on the control channel of the cell on which it is camped.\nc)\tIf the PLMN or SNPN receives a call for the MS, it knows (in most cases) the registration area of the cell in which the MS is camped. It can then send a \"paging\" message for the MS on control channels of all the cells in the registration area. The MS will then receive the paging message because it is tuned to the control channel of a cell in that registration area, and the MS can respond on that control channel.\nd)\tIt enables the MS to receive cell broadcast messages.\nIf the MS is unable to find a suitable cell to camp on, or the SIM is not inserted, or there is no valid entry in \"list of subscriber data\" in case the MS is operating in SNPN access operation mode over 3GPP access, or if it receives certain responses to an LR request (e.g., \"illegal MS\"), it attempts to camp on a cell irrespective of the PLMN identity or the SNPN identity, and enters a \"limited service\" state in which it can only attempt to make emergency calls or to access RLOS. An MS operating in NB-S1 mode, never attempts to make emergency calls or to access RLOS. An MS operating in N1 mode never attempts to access RLOS.\nIf the MS is in eCall only mode, it attempts to camp on a suitable cell and enters an \"eCall inactive\" state in which it can only attempt an eCall over IMS, or a call to a non-emergency MSISDN or URI for test or terminal reconfiguration services as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 [40].\nIf the MS is in eCall only mode and is unable to find a suitable cell to camp on, it attempts to camp on an acceptable cell in limited service state, and enters an \"eCall inactive\" state in which it can only attempt an eCall over IMS.\nWhile in eCall inactive state, the MS does not perform LR with the PLMN of the cell on which the MS is camped.\nIn A/Gb mode, if the CTS MS is in CTS mode only or in automatic mode with CTS preferred, it will start by attempting to find a CTS fixed part on which it is enrolled.\nThe idle mode tasks can be subdivided into the following processes:\n-\tPLMN selection;\n-\tSNPN selection (N1 mode only);\n-\tCSG selection (Iu mode and S1 mode only);\n-\tCell selection and reselection;\n-\tLocation registration;\n-\tCTS fixed part selection (A/Gb mode only); and\n-\tCAG selection (N1 mode only).\nIn A/Gb mode, to make this initial CTS fixed part selection, the MS shall be enrolled on at least one fixed part.\nExcept for SNPN selection, the relationship between these processes is illustrated in figure 1 in clause 5. The states and state transitions within each process are shown in figure 2a, figure 2b, and figure 3 in clause 5.\nIn the present document, EMM-IDLE mode with suspend indication (see 3GPP TS 24.301 [23A]) and 5GMM-IDLE mode with suspend indication (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]) shall be considered the same as idle mode.",

      "content": "The MS normally operates on its home PLMN (HPLMN) or equivalent home PLMN (EHPLMN). However, a visited PLMN (VPLMN) may be selected, e.g., if the MS loses coverage. There are two modes for PLMN selection:\ni)\tAutomatic mode ‑ This mode utilizes a list of PLMN/access technology combinations in priority order. The highest priority PLMN/access technology combination which is available and allowable is selected.\nii)\tManual mode ‑ Here the MS indicates to the user which PLMNs are available. Only when the user makes a manual selection does the MS try to obtain normal service on the VPLMN.\nTo prevent repeated attempts to have roaming service on a not allowed area (i.e. LA or TA), when the MS is informed that an area is forbidden, the LA or TA is added to a list of \"forbidden location areas for roaming\" or \"forbidden tracking areas for roaming\" respectively which is stored in the MS. These lists, if existing, are deleted when the MS is switched off or when the SIM is removed, and periodically (with period in the range 12 to 24 hours). LA area restrictions are always valid for complete location areas independent of possible subdivision into GPRS routing areas. The structure of the routing area identifier (see 3GPP TS 23.003 [22A]) supports area restriction on LA basis.\nTo prevent repeated attempts to obtain service on a PLMN through satellite NG-RAN or satellite E-UTRAN access technology, when the MS receives an integrity protected reject message with cause value #78 \"PLMNs not allowed to operate at the present UE location\" from a satellite NG-RAN cell or a satellite E-UTRAN cell, the MS maintains a list of \"PLMNs not allowed to operate at the present UE location\" in which it stores the PLMN ID of the rejecting PLMN, the current geographical location, if known by the MS. A timer is started when the PLMN ID of the rejecting PLMN is added to the list of \"PLMNs not allowed to operate at the present UE location\". If the geographical location exists, a MS implementation specific distance value needs to be stored. An entry in the list is deleted if the timer associated to the entry expires or the MS successfully registers to the PLMN stored in the entry. An entry in the list may be deleted if the current UE location is known, a geographical location is stored for the entry of this PLMN, and the distance to the current UE location is larger than a UE implementation specific value. For details see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64] and 3GPP TS 24.301 [23A].\nNOTE 1:\tThe list of \"PLMNs not allowed to operate at the present UE location\" is provided to the AS, see 3GPP TS 38.304 [61].\nIn automatic PLMN selection mode, if the MS detects a PLMN in satellite NG-RAN access technology which is part of the list of \"PLMNs not allowed to operate at the present UE location\" the MS shall consider the PLMN as PLMN selection candidate for satellite NG-RAN access technology only if the current MS location is known, a geographical location is stored for the entry of this PLMN, and the distance to the current MS location is larger than a MS implementation specific value.\nThis does not prevent selection of such a PLMN if it is available in another RAT.\nA timer is started when the PLMN ID of the rejecting PLMN is added to the list of \"PLMNs not allowed to operate at the present UE location\".\nIn automatic PLMN selection mode, if the MS detects a PLMN in satellite E-UTRAN access technology which is part of the list of \"PLMNs not allowed to operate at the present UE location\" the MS shall consider the PLMN as PLMN selection candidate for satellite E-UTRAN access technology only if the current MS location is known, a geographical location is stored for the entry of this PLMN, and the distance to the current UE location is larger than a UE implementation specific value.\nThis does not prevent selection of such a PLMN if it is available in another RAT.\nIf a message with cause value #15 (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [23], 3GPP TS 24.301 [23A] and 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]) is received by an MS, then the MS shall take the following actions depending on the mode in which the message was received:\nA/Gb mode or Iu mode:\nThe location area is added to the list of \"forbidden location areas for roaming\" which is stored in the MS. The MS shall then search for a suitable cell in the same PLMN but belonging to an LA or TA which is not in the \"forbidden location areas for roaming\" or \"forbidden tracking areas for roaming\" list respectively.\nS1-mode:\nThe tracking area is added to the list of \"forbidden tracking areas for roaming\" which is stored in the MS. The MS shall then search for a suitable cell in the same PLMN but belonging to a TA or LA which is not in the \"forbidden tracking areas for roaming\" or \"forbidden location areas for roaming\" list respectively\nN1-mode:\nThe tracking area is added to the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming\" which is stored in the MS.

Both lists can be retrieved either from the USIM if the lists are available in the USIM, or as described in 3GPP TS 24.285 [47] if the lists are not available in the USIM. These lists have zero or more entries.\nNOTE 1:\tThe network also updates the Allowed CSG list in the same updating operation if one or more entries are removed from the Operator CSG list. This avoids an entry removed from the Operator CSG list remaining in the Allowed CSG list.\nThere are two modes of CSG selection:\n-\tAutomatic mode: This mode utilizes the Allowed CSG list and the Operator CSG list. After a PLMN is selected, the MS camps on a cell in that PLMN only if the cell is either not a CSG cell or it is a CSG cell with a CSG identity that is in the Allowed CSG list or in the Operator CSG List. The idle mode procedures of NAS are not impacted by this mode. Upon switch on the MS is in automatic mode.\n-\tManual mode: In this mode, the MS indicates to the user a list of available CSGs and the associated PLMNs. Based on configuration by the HPLMN, the list of CSGs provided to the user for a certain PLMN is either:\n-\tnot restricted by the Allowed CSG list and the Operator CSG List stored in the MS; or\n-\trestricted to entries in the Operator CSG List only.\nAfter the user makes a selection, the MS camps on a cell with the selected CSG identity and may attempt to register with the associated PLMN (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [23] and 3GPP TS 24.301 [23A]).\nThe permitted CSG list is a combination of Operator CSG list and the Allowed CSG list.

When in the limited service state with a valid SIM, the MS shall search for available and allowable PLMNs in the manner described in clause 4.4.3.1 and when indicated in the SIM also as described in clause 4.4.3.4. For an MS that is not in eCall only mode, with the exception of performing GPRS attach or EPS attach for emergency bearer services, performing an initial registration for emergency services, or performing EPS attach for access to RLOS, no LR requests are made until a valid SIM is present and either a suitable cell is found or a manual network reselection is performed. For an MS in eCall only mode, no LR requests are made except for performing EPS attach for emergency bearer services or an initial registration for emergency services. When performing GPRS attach or EPS attach for emergency bearer services, an initial registration for emergency services, or performing EPS attach for access to RLOS, the PLMN of the current serving cell is considered as the selected PLMN for the duration the MS is attached for emergency bearer services, registered for emergency services, or attached for access to RLOS.

If the MS is enabled for SNPN, the MS needs to make an emergency call, there is no available PLMN supporting emergency services and the MS determines that there is an available SNPN supporting emergency services (based on broadcasted information of SNPN support for emergency services), the MS may start operating in SNPN access operation mode over 3GPP access and attempt to camp on a cell of the SNPN supporting emergency services. After an emergency call is released, the MS should stop operating in SNPN access operation mode over 3GPP access and perform PLMN selection. If the MS is enabled for SNPN and wants to perform configuration of SNPN subscription parameters in PLMN via the user plane, but there is no available PLMN for normal services, either because of no available PLMN or all available PLMNs being in forbidden PLMN list due to LR failure, the MS may start operating in SNPN access operation mode over 3GPP access (if the MS is configured with default UE credentials) and perform SNPN selection as per subclause 4.9.3.1.3 or 4.9.3.1.4. After the onboarding services in SNPN are complete, the MS may stop operating in SNPN access operation mode over 3GPP access and perform PLMN selection.\nFor the items a, c, d and f, if the MS operates in SNPN access operation mode over 3GPP access and the MS has a valid entry in the \"list of subscriber data\", the MS shall search for available and allowable SNPNs in the manner described in clause 4.9.3.1.

In the limited service state, the presence of the MS need not be known to the SNPN on whose cell it has camped. If the MS needs to make an emergency call, the MS supports accessing a PLMN, and there is no available SNPN supporting emergency services and the MS determines that there is an available PLMN supporting emergency services (based on broadcasted information of PLMN support for emergency services), the MS shall stop operating in SNPN access operation mode over 3GPP access and attempt to camp on a cell of the PLMN supporting emergency services so that emergency calls can be made. After an emergency call is released, the MS may re-start operating in SNPN access operation mode over 3GPP access and perform SNPN selection. If the MS is enabled for SNPN and wants to select an SNPN for onboarding services in SNPN, but finds no suitable SNPN as per subclause 4.9.3.1.3 or 4.9.3.1.4, the MS may stop operating in SNPN access operation mode over 3GPP access, and perform PLMN selection (if the MS is configured with PLMN credentials in USIM). The MS may perform PLMN selection as per clause 4.4. After the configuration of SNPN subscription parameters in PLMN via the user plane is complete, the MS may start operating in SNPN access operation mode over 3GPP access and perform SNPN selection. If the MS supports access to an SNPN providing access for localized services in SNPN and access for localized services in SNPN is enabled, and the MS is in limited service state because no SNPN is available as per subclause 4.9.3.1, when the validity information of an SNPN based on the \"credentials holder controlled prioritized list of preferred SNPNs for access for localized services in SNPN\" or \"credentials holder controlled prioritized list of preferred GINs for access for localized services in SNPN\" changes from not met to met, the MS shall perform an SNPN selection as per subclause 4.9.3.1.\nThere are also other conditions under which only emergency calls or access to RLOS may be made if the MS does not operate in SNPN access operation mode over 3GPP access. These are shown in table 2 in clause 5. ProSe communications can be initiated in case of PLMN if necessary (see 3GPP TS 24.334 [51] or 3GPP TS 24.554 [80]) when in the limited service state due to items a) or c) or f). V2X communication over PC5 can be initiated if necessary (see 3GPP TS 24.386 [59] or 3GPP TS 24.587 [75]) when in the limited service state due to items a) or c) or f). A2X communication over PC5 can be initiated if necessary (see 3GPP TS 24.577 [86]) when in the limited service state due to items a) or c) or f).\nFor the items i and j for an MS operating in automatic PLMN selection mode, when the time validity information of one or more CAG-IDs change from not authorized to authorized based on the \"Allowed CAG list\" associated with a PLMN other than the current PLMN in the \"CAG information list\" stored in the MS, and the MS does not have a PDU session for emergency services, the MS shall perform PLMN selection as per subclause 4.4.3.1. If the MS has an emergency PDU session established, then the MS shall attempt to perform PLMN selection after the emergency PDU session is released if the time validity information of one or more CAG-IDs are still authorized based on the \"Allowed CAG list\" associated with that PLMN.",

Otherwise, the PLMN selection procedures are performed without registration.\nThe ME shall utilise all the information stored in the SIM related to the PLMN selection; e.g. \"HPLMN Selector with Access Technology\", \"User Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\", \"Forbidden PLMNs\", \"Equivalent HPLMN\", see 3GPP TS 31.102 [40]. The ME shall also utilise the extension of the \"forbidden PLMNs\" list that it has stored locally on the ME if available.\nThe ME shall either utilise the \"Operator controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\" that it has stored locally on the ME, or the Operator controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\" stored in the SIM, for the purposes of PLMN selection.\nThe \"HPLMN Selector with Access Technology\", \"User Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\" and \"Operator Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\" data files in the SIM include associated access technologies for each PLMN entry, see 3GPP TS 31.102 [40]. The PLMN/access technology combinations are listed in priority order. If an entry indicates more than one access technology, then no priority is defined for the access technologies within this entry and the priority applied to each access technology within this entry is an implementation issue. If no particular access technology is indicated in an entry, it shall be assumed that all access technologies supported by the ME apply to the entry. If an entry only indicates access technologies not supported by the ME, the entry shall be ignored. If an entry indicates at least one access technology supported by the ME, the entry shall be used in the PLMN selection procedures if the other criteria defined for the specific PLMN selection procedures are fulfilled.\nThe Mobile Equipment stores a list of \"equivalent PLMNs\". This list is replaced or deleted at the end of each location update procedure, routing area update procedure, GPRS attach procedure, tracking area update procedure, EPS attach procedure, and registration procedure. The list is deleted by an MS attached for emergency bearer services or for access to RLOS after detach or registered for emergency services after de-registration. The stored list consists of a list of equivalent PLMNs as downloaded by the network plus the PLMN code of the registered PLMN that downloaded the list. All PLMNs in the stored list, in all access technologies supported by the PLMN, are regarded as equivalent to each other for PLMN selection, cell selection/re-selection and handover.\nWhen the MS reselects to a cell in a shared network, and the cell is a suitable cell for multiple PLMN identities received on the BCCH or on the EC-BCCH the AS indicates these multiple PLMN identities to the NAS according to 3GPP TS 44.018 [34], 3GPP TS 44.060 [39], 3GPP TS 25.304 [32], 3GPP TS 36.304 [43] and 3GPP TS 38.304 [61]. The MS shall choose one of these PLMNs. If the registered PLMN is available among these PLMNs, the MS shall not choose a different PLMN.\nThe MS shall not use the PLMN codes contained in the \"HPLMN Selector with Access Technology\" data file.\nIt is possible for the home network operator to identify alternative Network IDs as the HPLMN. If the EHPLMN list is present, and not empty, the entries in the EHPLMN list are used in the network selection procedures. When attempting to select a network the highest priority EHPLMN that is available shall be selected. If the EHPLMN list is present and is empty or if the EHPLMN list is not present, the HPLMN derived from the IMSI is used for network selection procedures.\nNOTE 1:\tThe \"HPLMN Selector with Access Technology\" data file is only used by the MS to get the HPLMN access technologies related to the HPLMN code which corresponds to the PLMN code included in the IMSI if the EHPLMN list is not present or is empty. If the EHPLMN list is present then this data field is applicable to all the entries within the EHPLMN list.\nNOTE 2:\tDifferent GSM frequency bands (e.g. 900, 1800, 1900, 400) are all considered GSM access technology. An MS supporting more than one band should scan all the bands it's supports when scanning for GSM frequencies. However GSM COMPACT systems which use GSM frequency bands but with the CBPCCH broadcast channel are considered as a separate access technology from GSM.\nNOTE 3:\tThe inclusion of the HPLMN derived from the IMSI in the EHPLMN list is allowed. The priority of the HPLMN derived from the IMSI is given by its position in the EHPLMN list, see 3GPP TS 31.102 [40].\nThe MS may support minimization of service interruption (MINT).",

In A/Gb mode an MS not supporting packet services shall not search for CPBCCH carriers.\nIf successful registration is achieved, the MS indicates the selected PLMN.\nIf:\n-\tthere is no registered PLMN;\n-\tregistration is not possible due to the PLMN being unavailable or registration failure; or\n-\tsignal level enhanced network selection is applicable (see clause 3.11) and the received signal quality of all access technologies (if the MS is capable of and if it is available) from the registered PLMN or equivalent PLMN (if available) is lower than the \"Operator controlled signal threshold per access technology\" stored in the USIM of the corresponding access technology.\nthe MS follows one of the following two procedures depending on its PLMN selection operating mode. At switch on, if the MS provides the optional feature of user preferred PLMN selection operating mode at switch on then this operating mode shall be used. Otherwise, the MS shall use the PLMN selection mode that was used before switching off.\nEXCEPTION: At switch on, if the MS is in manual mode and neither registered PLMN nor PLMN that is equivalent to it is available, but EHPLMN is available, then instead of performing the manual network selection mode procedure of clause 4.4.3.1.2 the MS may select and attempt registration on the highest priority EHPLMN. If the EHPLMN list is not available or is empty and the HPLMN is available, then the MS may select and attempt registration on the HPLMN. If the MS supports CAG and needs to select or attempt registration on the highest priority EHPLMN or HPLMN, the MS follows network selection procedures of clause 4.4.3.1.1 bullet m). The MS shall remain in manual mode.\nNOTE 3:\tIf successful registration is achieved, then the current serving PLMN becomes the registered PLMN and the MS does not store the previous registered PLMN for later use.\nEXCEPTION: If registration is not possible on recovery from lack of coverage due to the registered PLMN being unavailable, an MS attached to GPRS services, attached via E-UTRAN or registered via the NG-RAN may, optionally, continue looking for the registered PLMN for an implementation dependent time.\nNOTE 4:\tAn MS attached to GPRS services, attached via E-UTRAN or registered via the NG-RAN should use the above exception only if one or more PDP contexts, PDN connections or PDU sessions are currently active.\nEXCEPTION: At switch on, if the RPLMN is a PLMN with which the MS was registered for disaster roaming services and the MS is registered via non-3GPP access connected to 5GCN or an NG-RAN cell of the RPLMN broadcasts neither the disaster related indication nor a \"list of one or more PLMN(s) with disaster condition for which disaster roaming services is offered by the available PLMN\" including the UE determined PLMN with disaster condition or an allowable PLMN is available then the MS will ignore RPLMN and its equivalent PLMN.",

Additionally, the MS shall follow the requirements of the present document in its signalling procedures towards any 3GPP network.

See clause 1.2 for the definition of country.\nAnnex C (normative):Control plane solution for steering of roaming in 5GS\nC.0\tRequirements for 5G steering of roaming over the control plane\nIn addition to the requirements specified in 3GPP TS 22.011 [9] clause 3.2.2.8, 3GPP TS 22.261 [74] clause 6.30 and 3GPP TS 23.501 [62] clause 5.30.2.2, the requirements in this clause apply.\nThe UE supporting N1 mode shall support the control plane solution for steering of roaming in 5GS. If the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN supports and wants to use the control plane solution for steering of roaming in 5GS, then the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN shall provide the steering of roaming information to the UE using the control plane mechanism defined in this annex.\nThe VPLMN shall transparently relay the steering of roaming information received from the HPLMN to the UE. The UE shall be able to detect whether the VPLMN removed the steering of roaming information during the initial registration procedure in the VPLMN. The UE shall be able to detect whether the VPLMN altered the steering of roaming information. If the UE detects that the VPLMN altered or removed the steering of roaming information then the UE shall consider the current VPLMN as the lowest priority PLMN and perform PLMN selection as defined in this annex.\nThe non-subscribed SNPN shall transparently relay the steering of roaming information received from the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN to the UE. The UE shall be able to detect whether the non-subscribed SNPN removed the steering of roaming information during the initial registration procedure in the non-subscribed SNPN. The UE shall be able to detect whether the non-subcribed SNPN altered the steering of roaming information. If the UE detects that the non-subscribed SNPN altered or removed the steering of roaming information then the UE shall consider the current SNPN as the lowest priority SNPN and perform SNPN selection as defined in this annex.\nC.1\tGeneral\nC.1.1\tSteering of roaming over the control plane in a PLMN\nThe purpose of the control plane solution for steering of roaming in 5GS procedure in a PLMN is to allow the HPLMN to update one or more of the following via NAS signalling:\na)\tthe \"Operator Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\" list in the UE by providing the HPLMN protected list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations or a secured packet;\nb)\tthe SOR-CMCI;\nc)\tthe SOR-SNPN-SI associated with the selected PLMN subscription in the ME;\nd)\tthe SOR-SNPN-SI-LS associated with the selected PLMN subscription in the ME; and\ne) \tthe SOR-SENSE (i.e the \"Operator controlled signal threshold per access technology\") provided in a secured packet.\nIf the selected PLMN is a VPLMN, the HPLMN can provide the steering of roaming information to the UE using the control plane mechanism during and after registration. If the selected PLMN is the HPLMN, the HPLMN can provide the steering of roaming information to the UE using the control plane mechanism after registration only. The HPLMN updates the \"Operator Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\" based on the operator policies, which can be based on the registered VPLMN, the location of the UE, etc.\nThe HPLMN may update the \"Operator controlled signal threshold per access technology\" based on the operator policies and the operator specific data analytic information.\nThe HPLMN can configure their subscribed UE's USIM to indicate that the UE is expected to receive the steering of roaming information due to initial registration in 5GS in a VPLMN. At the same time the HPLMN will mark the UE is expected to receive the steering of roaming information due to initial registration in 5GS in a VPLMN, in the subscription information in the UDM. In this case, it is mandatory for the HPLMN to provide the steering of roaming information to the UE during initial registration in a VPLMN. Otherwise, if such configuration is not provided in the USIM, it is optional for the HPLMN to provide the steering of roaming information to the UE during initial registration (based on operator policy). The HPLMN can provide the steering of roaming information to the UE during the registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]) and initial registration procedure for emergency services. In addition, the HPLMN can request the UE to provide an acknowledgement of successful reception of the steering of roaming information.\nNOTE 1:\tIn annex C of this specification, the User Data Repository (UDR) is considered as part of the UDM.\nAs the HPLMN needs to consider certain criteria including the number of customers distributed through multiple VPLMNs in the same country or region, the list of the preferred PLMN/access technology combinations is not necessarily the same at all times and for all users. The list of the preferred PLMN/access technology combinations needs to be dynamically generated, e.g. generated on demand, by a dedicated steering of roaming application function (SOR-AF) providing operator specific data analytics solutions.\nNOTE 2:\tThe functional description of this dedicated application function (SOR-AF) is out of scope of 3GPP.\nThe steering of roaming connected mode control information (SOR-CMCI) enables the HPLMN to control the timing of a UE in 5GS connected mode to move to idle mode to perform the steering of roaming. If the UE selects a cell of any access technology other than NG-RAN, the SOR procedure is terminated (see clause C.4.2). The UE shall support the SOR-CMCI. The support and use of SOR-CMCI by the HPLMN is based on the HPLMN's operator policy.\nThe following requirements are applicable for the SOR-CMCI:\n-\tThe HPLMN may configure SOR-CMCI in the UE and may also send SOR-CMCI over N1 NAS signalling. The SOR-CMCI received over N1 NAS signalling has precedence over the SOR-CMCI configured in the UE.\nNOTE 3:\tBased on HPLMN policy, while setting the SOR-CMCI the HPLMN can take into consideration the user preference for the service(s) not to be interrupted due to SOR (e.g. MMTEL voice call, MMTEL video call, HPLMN defined services, among others). The user can communicate its preference for the service(s) not to be interrupted due to SOR to the HPLMN utilizing non-standard operator-specific mechanisms, e.g. web-based.\n-\tThe UE shall indicate ME's support for SOR-CMCI to the HPLMN.\nNOTE 4:\tThe HPLMN has the knowledge of the USIM's capabilities in supporting SOR-CMCI.\n-\tWhile performing SOR, the UE shall consider the list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations or secured packet received in the SOR information together with the available SOR-CMCI.\n-\tThe HPLMN may provision the SOR-CMCI in the UE over N1 NAS signalling. The UE shall store the configured SOR-CMCI in the non-volatile memory of the ME or in the USIM as described in clause C.4.\nThe following requirement is applicable for the SOR-SNPN-SI:\n-\tIf the UE supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder, the UE shall indicate ME's support for SOR-SNPN-SI to the HPLMN or EHPLMN.\nThe following requirement is applicable for the SOR-SNPN-SI-LS:\n-\tIf the UE supports access to an SNPN providing access for localized services in SNPN, the UE shall indicate ME's support for SOR-SNPN-SI-LS to the HPLMN.\nIn order to support various deployment scenarios, the UDM may support at least one of the following functionalities:\na)\tobtaining a list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations, SOR-CMCI, if any (if supported by the UDM and required by the HPLMN), or a secured packet which is available or becomes available in the UDM (i.e. retrieved from the UDR); or\nNOTE 5:\tA secured packet can be made available at the UDR via implementation specific means. In this case the implementation specific means are required to ensure that the secured packet satisfies the \"Replay detection and Sequence Integrity counter\" (see ETSI TS 102 225 [73]) every time it is sent out from the HPLMN to the UE.\nb)\tobtaining a list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations, SOR-CMCI, if any (if supported by the UDM and required by the HPLMN), or a secured packet from the SOR-AF.\nThe HPLMN policy for the SOR-AF invocation can be present in the UDM only if the UDM supports obtaining a list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations, SOR-CMCI, if any, or a secured packet from the SOR-AF.\nThe UDM discards any list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations, SOR-CMCI, if any, or any secured packet obtained from the SOR-AF or which is or becomes available in the UDM (i.e. retrieved from the UDR), either during registration (as specified in annex C.2) or after registration (as specified in annex C.3 and C.4.3), when the UDM cannot successfully forward the SOR information to the AMF (e.g. in case the UDM receives the response from the SOR-AF with the list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations, the SOR-CMCI, if any, if any, the secured packet after the expiration of the operator specific timer, or if there is no AMF registered for the UE).\nThe UE maintains a list of \"PLMNs where registration was aborted due to SOR\". If the UE receives steering of roaming information in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT or DL NAS TRANSPORT message and the security check to verify that the steering of roaming information is provided by HPLMN is successful, the UE shall remove the current selected PLMN from the list of \"PLMNs where registration was aborted due to SOR\". The UE shall delete the list of \"PLMNs where registration was aborted due to SOR\" when the MS is switched off or the USIM is removed. The UE may also remove PLMN(s) from the list of \"PLMNs where registration was aborted due to SOR\" after a UE implementation dependent time.\nIf:\na)\tthe UE's USIM is configured to indicate that the UE shall expect to receive the steering of roaming information during initial registration procedure but did not receive it or security check on the steering of roaming information fails;\nb)\tthe current chosen VPLMN is not contained in the list of \"PLMNs where registration was aborted due to SOR\";\nc)\tthe current chosen VPLMN is not part of \"User Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\" list; and\nd)\tthe UE is not in manual mode of operation;\nthen the UE will perform PLMN selection with the current VPLMN considered as lowest priority.\nIt is mandatory for the VPLMN to transparently forward to the UE the steering of roaming information received from HPLMN and to transparently forward to the HPLMN the acknowledgement of successful reception of the steering of roaming information received from UE, both while the UE is trying to register onto the VPLMN as described in clause C.2, and after the UE has registered onto the VPLMN as described in clause C.3 and C.4.3.\nIf the last received steering of roaming information contains the list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations then the ME shall not delete the \"Operator Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\" list stored in the non-volatile memory of the ME when the UE is switched off.\nThe \"Operator Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\" list shall be stored in the non-volatile memory of the ME together with the SUPI from the USIM. The ME shall delete the \"Operator Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\" list stored in the ME when a new USIM is inserted.\nThe procedure in this annex for steering of UE in VPLMN can be initiated by the network while the UE is trying to register onto the VPLMN as described in clause C.2, or after the UE has registered onto the HPLMN or the VPLMN as described in clause C.3, C.7 and C.4.3.\nC.1.2\tSteering of roaming over the control plane in an SNPN\nThe purpose of the control plane solution for steering of roaming in 5GS procedure in an SNPN is to allow the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN to update one or more of the following via NAS signalling:\na)\tthe SOR-SNPN-SI associated with the selected entry of \"list of subscriber data\" or the selected PLMN subscription in the ME, for a UE which supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credential holder;\nb)\tthe SOR-CMCI; and\nc)\tthe SOR-SNPN-SI-LS associated with the selected entry of \"list of subscriber data\" or the selected PLMN subscription in the ME, if the UE supports access to an SNPN providing access for localized services in SNPN.\nThe control plane solution for steering of roaming in 5GS procedure in an SNPN can also be used by the HPLMN to update the \"Operator Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\" list in the UE by providing the HPLMN protected list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations or a secured packet via NAS signalling.\nThe HPLMN or subscribed SNPN can provide the steering of roaming information to the UE using the control plane mechanism during and after registration. The HPLMN or subscribed SNPN updates the SOR-SNPN-SI based on the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN policies, which can be based on the registered SNPN, the location of the UE, etc. The control plane solution for steering of roaming in 5GS procedure in an SNPN is not applicable for credentials holder with AAA server.\nIf the UE supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder:\na)\tthe UE shall indicate ME's support for SOR-SNPN-SI when registering in a subscribed SNPN, in the HPLMN or in the EHPLMN; and\naa)\tthe UE supporting equivalent SNPNs shall indicate ME's support for SOR-SNPN-SI when registering in a non-subscribed SNPN; and\nb)\tthe UE may indicate ME's support for SOR-SNPN-SI when sending an SOR transparent container including a UE acknowledgement in a PLMN.\nWhen the UE indicates ME's support for SOR-SNPN-SI in the 5GMM capability in initial registration or emergency registration or when ME's support for SOR-SNPN-SI changes in mobility registration update, the AMF shall inform the UDM.\nWhen the UE supports equivalent SNPNs, the ME does not support SOR-SNPN-SI and the UE is in an equivalent SNPN of the subscribed SNPN, the AMF shall inform the UDM.\nThe HPLMN or subscribed SNPN can configure their subscribed UEs' SNPN configuration parameters associated with the PLMN subscription or the selected entry of the \"list of subscriber data\", respectively, to expect to receive the steering of roaming information due to initial registration in a non-subscribed SNPN. At the same time the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN will mark the UE as expecting to receive the steering of roaming information due to initial registration in a non-subscribed SNPN, in the subscription information in the UDM. In this case, it is mandatory for the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN to provide the steering of roaming information to the UE during initial registration in a non-subscribed SNPN. Otherwise if such configuration is not provided in the ME, it is optional for the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN to provide the steering of roaming information to the UE during initial registration (based on HPLMN or subscribed SNPN policy). The HPLMN or subscribed SNPN can provide the steering of roaming information to the UE during the registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]) and initial registration procedure for emergency services. In addition, the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN can request the UE to provide an acknowledgement of successful reception of the steering of roaming information.\nNOTE 1:\tIn annex C of this specification, the User Data Repository (UDR) is considered as part of the UDM.\nAs the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN needs to consider certain criteria including the number of customers distributed through multiple SNPNs in the same country or region, the SOR-SNPN-SI is not necessarily the same at all times and for all users.\nNOTE 2:\tThe functional description of this dedicated application function (SOR-AF) is out of scope of 3GPP.\nThe steering of roaming connected mode control information (SOR-CMCI) enables the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN to control the timing of a UE in connected mode to move to idle mode, if the UE decides to perform SNPN selection upon receiving the steering of roaming information. The UE shall support the SOR-CMCI. The support and use of SOR-CMCI by the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN is based on the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN policy.\nThe following requirements are applicable for the SOR-CMCI:\n-\tThe HPLMN or subscribed SNPN may configure SOR-CMCI in the UE and may also send SOR-CMCI over N1 NAS signalling. The SOR-CMCI received over N1 NAS signalling has precedence over the SOR-CMCI configured in the UE.\n-\tThe UE shall indicate ME's support for SOR-CMCI to the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN.\nNOTE 3:\tIf the credentials holder is the HPLMN, the HPLMN has the knowledge of the USIM's capabilities in supporting SOR-CMCI.\n-\tWhile performing SOR, the UE shall consider the SOR-SNPN-SI and SOR-SNPN-SI-LS (if any) received in the SOR information together with the available SOR-CMCI.\n-\tThe HPLMN or subscribed SNPN may provision the SOR-CMCI in the UE over N1 NAS signalling. The UE shall store the configured SOR-CMCI in the non-volatile memory of the ME or in the USIM as described in clause C.4.\nThe following requirement is applicable for the SOR-SNPN-SI-LS:\n-\tIf the UE supports access to an SNPN providing access for localized services in SNPN, the UE shall indicate ME's support for SOR-SNPN-SI-LS to the subscribed SNPN or the HPLMN.\nIn order to support various deployment scenarios, the UDM may support:\n-\tobtaining the SOR-SNPN-SI and SOR-SNPN-SI-LS, if any (if supported by the UDM and required by the HPLMN), which are or becomes available in the UDM (i.e. retrieved from the UDR);\n-\tobtaining the SOR-SNPN-SI and SOR-SNPN-SI-LS, if any (if supported by the UDM and required by the HPLMN), from the SOR-AF; or\n-\tboth of the above.\nThe HPLMN or subscribed SNPN policy for the SOR-AF invocation can be present in the UDM only if the UDM supports obtaining the SOR-SNPN-SI and SOR-SNPN-SI-LS, if any, from the SOR-AF.\nThe UDM discards any SOR-SNPN-SI and SOR-SNPN-SI-LS, if any, obtained from the SOR-AF or which are or becomes available in the UDM (i.e. retrieved from the UDR), either during registration (as specified in annex C.5) or after registration (as specified in annex C.6), when the UDM cannot successfully forward the SOR information to the AMF (e.g. in case the UDM receives the response from the SOR-AF with the SOR-SNPN-SI and SOR-SNPN-SI-LS, if any, after the expiration of the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN specific timer, or if there is no AMF registered for the UE).\nIf the UE is registering on the subscribed SNPN and the UE has not indicated ME's support for SOR-SNPN-SI in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message, the UDM shall delete the stored \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI\" indicator, if any, and shall not provide the SOR-SNPN-SI to the UE after registration.\nIf the UE is registering on the subscribed SNPN and the UE has indicated ME's support for SOR-SNPN-SI in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message, the UDM shall store the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI\" indicator and may provide the SOR-SNPN-SI to the UE after registration based on the subscribed SNPN or HPLMN policy.\nThe UE maintains a list of \"SNPNs where registration was aborted due to SOR\" per entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" or the PLMN subscription.

The selected PLMN is the VPLMN. The AMF is located in the selected VPLMN.\nFigure C.2.1: Procedure for providing list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations and the SOR-CMCI, if any, or secured packet during registration\nFor the steps below, security protection is described in 3GPP TS 33.501 [66].\n1)\tThe UE to the VPLMN AMF: The UE initiates initial registration, emergency registration or registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]) to the VPLMN AMF by sending REGISTRATION REQUEST message with the 5GS registration type IE indicating \"initial registration\", \"emergency registration\" or \"mobility registration updating\";\n2)\tUpon receiving REGISTRATION REQUEST message, the VPLMN AMF executes the registration procedure as defined in clause 4.2.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [63]. As part of the registration procedure:\na)\tthe AMF provides the registration type to the UDM using Nudm_UECM_Registration. As a consequence, in case of the 5GS registration type message indicates \"initial registration\" or \"emergency registration\" the UDM shall delete the stored \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator, if any, the stored \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI\" indicator, if any, and the stored \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI-LS\" indicator, if any, in UDR using Nudr_DM_Update service operation (see 3GPP TS 23.502 [63]).\nNOTE 1:\tNudr_DM_Update service operation corresponds to Nudr_DR_Update service operation (see 3GPP TS 29.504 [82] and 3GPP TS 29.505 [83]).\nIn addition:\na)\tif the VPLMN AMF does not have subscription data for the UE, the VPLMN AMF invokes Nudm_SDM_Get service operation to the HPLMN UDM to get amongst other information the Access and Mobility Subscription data for the UE (see step 14b in clause 4.2.2.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [63]); or\nb)\tif the VPLMN AMF already has subscription data for the UE and:\ni)\tthe 5GS registration type IE in the received REGISTRATION REQUEST message indicates \"initial registration\" and the \"SoR Update Indicator for Initial Registration\" field in the UE context is set to 'the UDM requests the AMF to retrieve SoR information when the UE performs NAS registration type \"initial registration\"' as specified in table 5.2.2.2.2-1 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [63]); or\nii)\tthe 5GS registration type IE in the received REGISTRATION REQUEST message indicates \"emergency registration\" and the \"SoR Update Indicator for Emergency Registration\" field in the UE context is set to 'the UDM requests the AMF to retrieve SoR information when the UE performs NAS registration type \"emergency registration\"' as specified in table 5.2.2.2.2-1 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [63]);\nthen the VPLMN AMF invokes Nudm_SDM_Get service operation message to the HPLMN UDM to retrieve the steering of roaming information (see step 14b in clause 4.2.2.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [63]);\notherwise the VPLMN AMF sends a REGISTRATION ACCEPT message without the steering of roaming information to the UE and steps 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, 4, 5, 6 are skipped;\n3a)\tIf the user subscription information indicates to send the steering of roaming information due to initial registration in a VPLMN, then the HPLMN UDM shall provide the steering of roaming information to the UE when the UE performs initial registration in a VPLMN, otherwise the HPLMN UDM may provide the steering of roaming information to the UE, based on operator policy.\nNOTE 2:\tBased on operator deployment and policy, if the UDM receives the list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations from the UDR, and the UDM supports communication with the SP-AF, the UDM can send this list to the SP-AF requesting it to provide this information in a secured packet as defined in 3GPP TS 29.544 [71].\nIf the HPLMN UDM is to provide the steering of roaming information to the UE when the UE performs the registration in a VPLMN, and the HPLMN policy for the SOR-AF invocation is absent then steps 3b and 3c are not performed and the HPLMN UDM obtains the available list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations or the available secured packet (i.e. all retrieved from the UDR). In addition, if the HPLMN UDM obtains the list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations and the \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator is stored for the UE, then the HPLMN UDM shall obtain the SOR-CMCI, if available, otherwise the HPLMN UDM shall not obtain the SOR-CMCI.

This is achieved by the HPLMN indicating to the UE the criteria for releasing specific PDU session(s) or services and entering idle mode.\nNOTE 1:\tThe released PDU sessions may be re-established by the application once the UE successfully registers on a higher priority PLMN or SNPN. User interaction is required for some applications.\nThe HPLMN or subscribed SNPN may configure the SOR-CMCI in the UE, and may also provide the SOR-CMCI to the UE over N1 NAS signalling. The SOR-CMCI received over N1 NAS signalling takes precedence over the SOR-CMCI stored in the non-volatile memory of the ME or stored in the USIM.\nNOTE 2:\tThe SOR-CMCI received over N1 NAS signalling in the steering of roaming information is either the SOR-CMCI in the USAT REFRESH with command qualifier of type \"Steering of Roaming\" (see 3GPP TS 31.111 [41]) which is received in a secured packet, or the SOR-CMCI received in plain text.\nIf the UE receives SOR information containing the list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations or SOR-SNPN-SI without SOR-CMCI, or the ME receives USAT REFRESH with command qualifier (see 3GPP TS 31.111 [41]) of type \"Steering of Roaming\" without SOR-CMCI, or the security check of the received steering of roaming information is not successful as described in clause C.2, clause C.3 and clause C.4.3, then:\n1)\tif the UE has SOR-CMCI stored in the non-volatile memory of the ME, the UE shall use the SOR-CMCI stored in the non-volatile memory of the ME; and\n2)\tif the UE has no SOR-CMCI stored in the non-volatile memory of the ME, the UE shall use the SOR-CMCI stored in the USIM, if any.\nThe UE shall delete the stored SOR-CMCI, if any, in the non-volatile memory of the ME and store the received SOR-CMCI in the non-volatile memory of the ME when:\n1)\tthe ME receives SOR-CMCI in the USAT REFRESH with command qualifier (see 3GPP TS 31.111 [41]) of type \"Steering of Roaming\"; or\n2)\tthe UE receives the steering of roaming information containing the SOR-CMCI in plain text over N1 NAS signalling and the UE receives the \"Store SOR-CMCI in ME\" indicator set to \"Store SOR-CMCI in ME\";\nThe SOR-CMCI shall be stored in the non-volatile memory of the ME together with the SUPI from the USIM. The ME shall not delete the SOR-CMCI when the UE is switched off. The ME shall delete the SOR-CMCI when a new USIM is inserted.\nThe MS shall be able to handle at least:\n-\t4 SOR-CMCI rules for PDU session attribute type criterion DNN of the PDU session;\n-\t4 SOR-CMCI rules for PDU session attribute type criterion S-NSSAI STT of the PDU session or S-NSSAI SST and SD of the PDU session; and\n-\t6 SOR-CMCI rules for any of the following types: service type criterion, SOR security check criterion or match all type criterion.\nIf the UE receives the steering of roaming information over N1 NAS signalling containing the SOR-CMCI together with the \"Store SOR-CMCI in ME\" indicator set to \"Do no store SOR-CMCI in ME\", the UE shall not overwrite the SOR-CMCI stored in the ME, if any, with the received SOR-CMCI, and shall apply the received SOR-CMCI for the procedure triggered by receiving the steering of roaming information containing that SOR-CMCI. If there is an ongoing SOR procedure, then the UE shall apply the received SOR-CMCI as described in clause C.4.\nSOR-CMCI consists of SOR-CMCI rules. Each SOR-CMCI rule consists of the following parameters:\ni)\ta criterion of one of the following types:\n-\tPDU session attribute type criterion;\n-\tservice type criterion;\n-\tSOR security check criterion; or\n-\tmatch all type criterion; and\nii)\ta value for Tsor-cm timer associated with each criterion presented in i) indicating the time the UE shall wait before releasing the PDU sessions or the services and entering idle mode.\nSOR-CMCI contains zero, one or more SOR-CMCI rules with PDU session attribute type criterion, zero, one or more SOR-CMCI rules with service type criterion, zero or one SOR-CMCI rule with SOR security check criterion and zero or one SOR-CMCI rule with match all type criterion.\nPDU session attribute type criterion consists of one of the following:\na)\tDNN of the PDU session;\nb)\tS-NSSAI STT of the PDU session; or\nc)\tS-NSSAI SST and SD of the PDU session.\nService type criterion consists of one of the following:\na)\tIMS registration related signalling;\nb)\tMMTEL voice call;\nc)\tMMTEL video call; or\nd)\tSMS over NAS or SMSoIP.\nSOR security check criterion consists of:\na)\tSOR security check not successful.\nMatch all type criterion consists of:\na)\tmatch all.\nWhen the SOR-CMCI received by the UE over N1 NAS signalling contains no SOR-CMCI rules, the UE shall stop all running Tsor-cm timers, if any, and shall not follow the procedure described in clause C.4.2. Additionally:\n-\tif the SOR-CMCI is received in plain text and it also contains the \"Store SOR-CMCI in ME\" indicator set to \"Store SOR-CMCI in ME\", the UE shall delete the stored SOR-CMCI in the non-volatile memory of the ME, if any; and\n-\tif the SOR-CMCI is received in a secured packet, and the USIM provides the ME with the SOR-CMCI in the USAT REFRESH with command qualifier of type \"Steering of Roaming\" (see 3GPP TS 31.111 [41]), then the UE shall delete the stored SOR-CMCI in the non-volatile memory of the ME, if any.\nThe HPLMN may update the SOR-CMCI in the USIM such that it contains no SOR-CMCI rules, in which case the UE behaviour described in clause C.4.2 applies. Also the HPLMN may make the SOR-CMCI file in the USIM unavailable (see 3GPP TS 31.102 [40]).\nIf there are more than one criterion applicable for a PDU session (e.g., a criterion for the PDU session and another one for the service) then the Tsor-cm timer with the highest value shall apply.\nIf there are more than one criterion applicable to different ongoing PDU sessions or services leading to multiple applicable Tsor-cm timers, then all the applicable Tsor-cm timers shall be started. Further handling of such cases is described in clause C.4.2.\nIf the value for Tsor-cm timer equals \"infinity\" then the UE shall wait until the PDU session is released or the service is stopped.\nThe Tsor-cm timer is applicable only if the UE is in automatic network selection mode.\nUpon switching to the manual network selection mode, the UE shall stop any Tsor-cm timer, if running. In this case, the UE is not required to enter idle mode and perform the de-registration procedure.\nThe UE shall consider the following services as exempted from being forced to release the related established PDU session, if any, enter idle mode and perform high priority PLMN/access technology or SNPN selection. These services are known to the UE by default and the UE shall not follow the SOR-CMCI criteria even if configured to interrupt such services:\ni)\temergency services.\nThe UE configured with high priority access in the selected PLMN or SNPN shall consider all services and all related established PDU sessions, if any, to be exempted from being forced to be released to enter idle mode and perform high priority PLMN/access technology or SNPN selection.\nC.4.2\tApplying SOR-CMCI in the UE\nDuring SOR procedure and while applying SOR-CMCI, the UE shall determine the time to release the PDU session(s) or the services as follows:\n-\tIf the UE encounters SOR security check not successful on the received steering of roaming information, and:\n-\tif a matching criterion \"SOR security check not successful\" is included in the stored SOR-CMCI, then the UE shall:\n-\tif the timer value is not zero, start an associated Tsor-cm timer with the value included in the SOR-CMCI;\n-\tstop all other running Tsor-cm timers, if any; and\n-\tnot start any new Tsor-cm timer while Tsor-cm timer associated with \"SOR security check not successful\" criterion is running;\n-\totherwise, the UE shall keep the Tsor-cm timers running, if any, and apply actions when the timers expire as described in this clause.\n-\tIf the UE encounters SOR security check successful on the received steering of roaming information and one or more SOR-CMCI rules are included in SOR-CMCI, where for each criterion:\na)\tDNN of the PDU session:\nthe UE shall check whether it has a PDU session with a DNN matching to the DNN included in SOR-CMCI, and if any, the UE shall, if the timer value is not zero, start an associated Tsor-cm timer with the value included in the SOR-CMCI;\nb)\tS-NSSAI SST of the PDU session:\nthe UE shall check whether it has a PDU session with a S-NSSAI SST matching the S-NSSAI SST included in SOR-CMCI, and if any, the UE shall, if the timer value is not zero, start an associated Tsor-cm timer with the value included in the SOR-CMCI;\nb1)\tS-NSSAI SST and SD of the PDU session:\nthe UE shall check whether it has a PDU session with a S-NSSAI SST and SD matching the S-NSSAI SST and SD included in SOR-CMCI, and if any, the UE shall, if the timer value is not zero, start an associated Tsor-cm timer with the value included in the SOR-CMCI;\nc)\tIMS registration related signalling:\nthe UE shall check whether IMS registration related signalling is ongoing, and if it is ongoing, the UE shall, if the timer value is not zero, start an associated Tsor-cm timer with the value included in the SOR-CMCI;\nd)\tMMTEL voice call:\nthe UE shall check whether MMTEL voice call is ongoing, and if it is ongoing, the UE shall, if the timer value is not zero, start an associated Tsor-cm timer with the value included in the SOR-CMCI;\ne)\tMMTEL video call:\nthe UE shall check whether MMTEL video call is ongoing, and if it is ongoing, the UE shall, if the timer value is not zero, start an associated Tsor-cm timer with the value included in the SOR-CMCI;\nf)\tSMS over NAS or SMSoIP:\nthe UE shall check whether SMS over NAS or SMSoIP services is ongoing, and if it is ongoing, the UE shall, if the timer value is not zero, start an associated Tsor-cm timer with the value included in the SOR-CMCI; or\ng)\tmatch all:\nthe UE shall check whether there are any PDU sessions or services for which there is no matching criterion in a) to f) above. If such PDU session or service exists, then for each of these PDU sessions or services, the UE shall, if the timer value is not zero, start an associated Tsor-cm timer with the value included in the SOR-CMCI.\nIf the SOR-CMCI is available, and:\n-\tthe SOR-CMCI used is in the USIM, contains no SOR-CMCI rule;\n-\tthere are one or more SOR-CMCI rules but there is no criterion matched with any ongoing PDU session or service; or\n-\tthere are one or more SOR-CMCI rules and there is one or more criteria matched with an ongoing PDU session or service, but the highest Tsor-cm timer value associated with the matched criteria is equal to zero;\nthen there is no Tsor-cm timer started for any PDU session or service.\nWhile one or more Tsor-cm timers are running, the UE shall check the newly established PDU session or service for a matching criterion in the SOR-CMCI:\n-\tIf a matching criterion is found and the applicable Tsor-cm timer indicated the value \"infinity\" then the UE shall start the Tsor-cm timer associated to the newly established PDU session or service with the value set to infinity; or\n-\tFor all other cases, if a matching criterion is found and the timer value is not zero then the UE shall start the Tsor-cm timer associated to the newly established PDU session or service with the value included in the SOR-CMCI, with the exception that if the value of the Tsor-cm timer included in the SOR-CMCI exceeds the highest value among the current values of all running Tsor-cm timers, then the value of the Tsor-cm timer for the newly established PDU session or service shall be set to the highest value among the current values of all running Tsor-cm timers.\nNOTE 1:\tFor newly established PDU session or service as described above, the timer is set irrespective of whether other ongoing PDU sessions or services that match the same criteria exist and for which corresponding Tsor-cm timers are running.\nNOTE 2:\tNAS 5GMM layer will receive an explicit indication from the upper layers that a service is started or stopped. When a service is started, it is handled as a new service in the procedures described in this clause.\nNOTE 3:\tWhile one or more Tsor-cm timers are running, the UE can trigger any 5GSM procedure or start new services.\nWhile one or more Tsor-cm timers are running, upon receiving a new SOR-CMCI as described in annex C.4.3, the UE shall check if there is a matching criterion found for any ongoing PDU session or service in the new SOR-CMCI:\n-\tif a matching criterion is found and the value of Tsor-cm timer in the new SOR-CMCI indicates the value \"infinity\", then:\na)\tif the Tsor-cm timer associated to the PDU session or service is not running, then the UE shall start the Tsor-cm timer associated to the PDU session or service with the value set to infinity; or\nb)\tif the Tsor-cm timer associated to the PDU session or service is already running, then the UE shall set the value of the Tsor-cm timer associated to the PDU session or service to infinity without stopping and restarting the timer;\n-\tif a matching criterion is found and the value of Tsor-cm timer in the new SOR-CMCI is other than infinity and is smaller than the current value of the running Tsor-cm timer for the associated PDU session or service, then the Tsor-cm timer value for the associated PDU session or service shall be replaced with the value in the new SOR-CMCI without stopping and restarting the timer; or\n-\tfor all other cases, the running Tsor-cm timers for the associated PDU sessions or services are kept unchanged.\nThe Tsor-cm timer shall be stopped when the associated PDU session is released or the associated service is stopped.\nIf the security check on the received steering of roaming information is successful, the UE shall stop the Tsor-cm timer associated with \"SOR security check not successful\", if running, and act on the received steering of roaming information. The current PLMN or SNPN is not considered as lowest priority.\nNOTE 4:\tThis also applies to the case when the current PLMN or SNPN is different from the PLMN or SNPN in which the Tsor-cm timer associated with \"SOR security check not successful\" was started.\nIf the UE, while one or more Tsor-cm timers are running:\na)\tenters idle mode not due to lower layer failure (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]);\nb)\tis not able to successfully recover the N1 NAS signalling connection (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]); or\nc)\tenters 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]);\nthen the UE shall stop the timer(s). In these cases, if:\na)\tthe UE has a list of available and allowable PLMNs or SNPNs in the area and based on this list or any other implementation specific means, the UE determines that there is a higher priority PLMN or SNPN than the selected VPLMN or non-subscribed SNPN; or\nb)\tthe UE does not have a list of available and allowable PLMNs or SNPNs in the area and is unable to determine whether there is a higher priority PLMN or SNPN than the selected VPLMN or non-subscribed SNPN using any other implementation specific means;\nthen the UE shall attempt to obtain service on a higher priority PLMN or SNPN as specified in clause 4.4.3.3 by acting as if timer T that controls periodic attempts has expired or as specified in clause 4.9.3.\nNOTE 5:\tWhen the UE enters idle mode due to lower layer failure while one or more Tsor-cm timers are running, then the UE does not stop Tsor-cm timer(s) as recovery of NAS signalling connection is possible (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]).\nWhen the UE determines that no Tsor-cm timer is started for any PDU session or service, the last running Tsor-cm timer is stopped due to release of the associated PDU sessions or stop of the associated services, or the last running Tsor-cm timer expires, if:\ni)\tthe UE has a list of available and allowable PLMNs or SNPNs in the area and based on this list or any other implementation specific means, the UE determines that there is a higher priority PLMN or SNPN than the selected VPLMN or non-subscribed SNPN; or\nii)\tthe UE does not have a list of available and allowable PLMNs or SNPNs in the area and is unable to determine whether there is a higher priority PLMN or SNPN than the selected VPLMN or non-subscribed SNPNusing any other implementation specific means;\nthen if the UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode, the UE shall perform the de-registration procedure (see clause 4.2.2.3 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [63]) that releases all the established PDU sessions and services, if any, and once the UE enters idle mode it shall attempt to obtain service on a higher priority PLMN or SNPN as specified in clause 4.4.3.3 by acting as if timer T that controls periodic attempts has expired or as specified in clause 4.9.3.\nNOTE 6:\tThe list of available and allowable PLMNs or SNPNs in the area is implementation specific.\nThe UE which has an emergency PDU session, receives a request from the upper layers to establish an emergency PDU session or perform emergency services fallback, registers for emergency services, or is configured for high priority access in the selected PLMN or SNPN is not required to enter idle mode if the last running Tsor-cm timer for any PDU session or service stops or expires. In this case, the UE shall attempt to perform the PLMN or SNPN selection after the emergency PDU session or the high priority service is released and after the UE enters idle mode or 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]).\nIf the UE selects a cell of any access technology other than NG-RAN, the ongoing SOR procedure is terminated and the UE shall stop applying SOR-CMCI and stop all running Tsor-cm timers without triggering any further actions.\nNOTE 7:\tIf the UE is served by any access technology other than NG-RAN, the HPLMN can initiate a steering of roaming procedure as specified in clause 4.4.6.\nC.4.3\tStage-2 flow for providing UE with SOR-CMCI in HPLMN, VPLMN, subscribed SNPN or non-subscribed SNPN after registration\nThe stage-2 flow for providing UE with SOR-CMCI in HPLMN, VPLMN, subscribed SNPN or non-subscribed SNPN after registration is indicated in figure C.4.3.1, when the ME supports the SOR-CMCI. The selected PLMN or SNPN can be the HPLMN, a VPLMN, the subscribed SNPN or a non-subscribed SNPN. The AMF is located in the selected PLMN or SNPN. The UDM is located in the HPLMN or the subscribed SNPN.\nIn this procedure, the SOR-CMCI is sent without the list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations and the SOR-SNPN-SI. In this procedure, the SOR-CMCI is sent in plain text or is sent within the secured packet.\nNOTE 0:\tWhen the UE is registered in a non-subscribed SNPN, the SOR-CMCI can be provided in a secured packet only if the UE is using a PLMN subscription to access the non-subscribed SNPN.\nNOTE 1:\tThe SOR-AF can determine that the ME supports the SOR-CMCI if the Nsoraf_SoR_Info service operation has returned the \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator. The UDM can determine that the ME supports the SOR-CMCI if the \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator is stored for the UE. How the SOR-AF determines that the USIM for the indicated SUPI supports SOR-CMCI is implementation specific.\nNOTE 2:\tThe secured packet provided by the SOR-AF can include SOR-CMCI only if the SOR-AF has determined that the ME supports the SOR-CMCI and the USIM of the indicated SUPI supports SOR-CMCI. Otherwise if only the \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator is stored for the UE, then SOR-CMCI, if any, cannot be included in the secured packet.\nThe procedure is triggered:\n-\tIf the UDM supports obtaining the parameters of the list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations, the SOR-SNPN-SI, the SOR-CMCI, and the \"Store SOR-CMCI in ME\" indicator, if any, or a secured packet from the SOR-AF, the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN policy for the SOR-AF invocation is present in the UDM and the SOR-AF provides the UDM with the SOR-CMCI for a UE identified by SUPI; or\n-\tWhen the SOR-CMCI becomes available in the UDM (i.e., retrieved from the UDR).\nFigure C.4.3.1: Procedure for configuring UE with SOR-CMCI after registration\nFor the steps below, security protection is described in 3GPP TS 33.501 [66].\n1)\tThe SOR-AF to the UDM: Nudm_ParameterProvision_Update request is sent to the UDM to trigger the update of the UE with the SOR-CMCI (in plain text or secured packet). In case of providing SOR-CMCI in plain text, include the \"Store SOR-CMCI in ME\" indicator, if applicable. In case of providing SOR-CMCI in a secured packet, include an indication that \"the list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations is not included in the secured packet\".\n2)\tThe UDM to the AMF: The UDM notifies the changes of the user profile to the affected AMF by the means of invoking Nudm_SDM_Notification service operation. The Nudm_SDM_Notification service operation contains the steering of roaming information that needs to be delivered transparently to the UE over NAS within the Access and Mobility Subscription data. If the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN decided that the UE is to acknowledge successful security check of the received steering of roaming information, the Nudm_SDM_Notification service operation also contains an indication that the UDM requests an acknowledgement from the UE as part of the steering of roaming information. The UDM:\n-\tupon receiving the SOR-CMCI (in plain text), shall:\ni)\tif the UE is registered in the HPLMN or a VPLMN, include the SOR-CMCI, the \"Store SOR-CMCI in ME\" indicator, if any, and the HPLMN indication that 'no change of the \"Operator Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\" list stored in the UE is needed and thus no list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations is provided';\nii)\tif the UE is registered in a non-subcribed SNPN, include the SOR-CMCI, the \"Store SOR-CMCI in ME\" indicator, if any, and the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN indication that 'no change of the SOR-SNPN-SI stored in the UE is needed and thus no SOR-SNPN-SI is provided'; and\niii)\tif the UE is registered in a subcribed SNPN and the AMF has reported to the UDM that the UE supports SOR-SNPN-SI, include the SOR-CMCI, the \"Store SOR-CMCI in ME\" indicator, if any, and the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN indication that 'no change of the SOR-SNPN-SI stored in the UE is needed and thus no SOR-SNPN-SI is provided'; or\n-\tupon receiving the SOR-CMCI in secured packet, shall include the secured packet into the steering of roaming information;\nNOTE 3:\tThe UDM considers \"the list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations is not included in the secured packet\" received together with the secured packet from the SOR-AF to indicate that the UE is not expected to perform SOR based on the associated steering of roaming information sent to the UE. However, the SOR-CMCI included in the secured packet can be applied by the UE if the UE has one or more Tsor-cm timers running as described in C.4.2.\nNOTE 4:\tThe UDM cannot provide the SOR-CMCI, if any, to the AMF which does not support receiving SoR transparent container (see 3GPP TS 29.503 [78]).\n3)\tThe AMF to the UE: the AMF sends a DL NAS TRANSPORT message to the served UE. The AMF includes in the DL NAS TRANSPORT message the steering of roaming information received from the UDM.\n4)\tUpon receiving the steering of roaming information containing the SOR-CMCI and the HPLMN indication that 'no change of the \"Operator Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\" list stored in the UE is needed and thus no list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations is provided' or the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN indication that 'no change of the SOR-SNPN-SI stored in the UE is needed and thus no SOR-SNPN-SI is provided', or the secured packet, the UE shall perform a security check on the steering of roaming information included in the DL NAS TRANSPORT message to verify that the steering of roaming information is provided by HPLMN or subscribed SNPN, and:\na)\tif the security check is successful, the UE shall store the SOR-CMCI according to clause C.4.1. If the UE has one or more Tsor-cm timers running, the UE shall apply the received SOR-CMCI as described in C.4.2.\nIf the steering of roaming information contains a secured packet and the UDM has requested an acknowledgement from the UE in the DL NAS TRANSPORT message, the UE sends an UL NAS TRANSPORT message to the serving AMF with an SOR transparent container including the UE acknowledgement and the UE shall set the \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator to \"supported\" only after the ME receives UICC responses indicating that the UICC has received the secured packet successfully. Otherwise, if the UDM has requested an acknowledgement from the UE in the DL NAS TRANSPORT message, the UE sends an UL NAS TRANSPORT message to the serving AMF with an SOR transparent container including the UE acknowledgement and the UE shall set the \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator to \"supported\". Additionally, if the UE supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder and the UE is in a PLMN, the UE may set the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI\" indicator to \"supported\".\nIf the UDM has not requested an acknowledgement from the UE then step 5 is skipped; and\nb)\tif the selected PLMN is a VPLMN or a non-subscribed SNPN, the security check is not successful and the UE is in automatic network selection mode, then:\n-\tif the UE has a stored SOR-CMCI, the current PLMN is considered as lowest priority and the UE shall apply the actions in clause C.4.2;\n-\totherwise, the UE shall wait until it moves to idle mode or 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]) before attempting to obtain service on a higher priority PLMN as specified in clause 4.4.3.3 by acting as if timer T that controls periodic attempts has expired, with an exception that the current PLMN is considered as lowest priority, or before attempting to obtain service on a higher priority SNPN as specified in clause 4.9.3, with an exception that the current registered SNPN is considered as lowest priority. If the selected PLMN or SNPN is a VPLMN or a non-subscribed SNPN and the UE has an established emergency PDU session then the UE shall attempt to perform the PLMN selection after the emergency PDU session is released and after the UE enters idle mode or 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]).\nStep 5 is skipped;\nNOTE 5:\tWhen the UE is in the manual mode of operation or the current chosen VPLMN is part of the \"User Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\" list or the current chosen non-subscribed SNPN is part of the user controlled prioritized list of preferred SNPNs for the selected entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" the selected PLMN subscription, the UE stays on the VPLMN or non-subscribed SNPN.\n5)\tThe AMF to the UDM: If the UL NAS TRANSPORT message with an SOR transparent container is received, the AMF uses the Nudm_SDM_Info service operation to provide the received SOR transparent container to the UDM. If the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN decided that the UE is to acknowledge successful security check of the received steering of roaming information in step 2, the UDM verifies that the acknowledgement is provided by the UE. If:\n-\tthe \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator in the header of the SOR transparent container is set to \"supported\", then the UDM shall store the \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator, otherwise the UDM shall delete the stored \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator, if any; and\n-\tthe \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI\" indicator in the header of the SOR transparent container is set to \"supported\", then the UDM shall store the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI\" indicator, otherwise the UDM shall delete the stored \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI\" indicator, if any; and\n6)\tThe UDM to the SOR-AF: Nsoraf_SoR_Info (SUPI of the UE, successful delivery, \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator, \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI\" indicator, if any). If the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN policy for the SOR-AF invocation is present and the UDM received and verified the UE acknowledgement in step 5, then the UDM informs the SOR-AF about successful delivery of the SOR-CMCI to the UE. The UDM shall include the \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator. If the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI\" indicator is stored for the UE, the UDM shall include the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI\" indicator.\nIf the selected PLMN is a VPLMN or a non-subscribed SNPN and:\n-\tthe UE in manual mode of operation encounters security check failure of SOR information in DL NAS TRANSPORT message; and\n-\tupon switching to automatic network selection mode the UE remembers that it is still registered on the PLMN the non-subscribed SNPN where the security check failure of SOR information was encountered;\nthe UE shall wait until it moves to idle mode or 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]) before attempting to obtain service on a higher priority PLMN as specified in clause 4.4.3.3, by acting as if timer T that controls periodic attempts has expired, with an exception that the current registered PLMN is considered as lowest priority, or before attempting to obtained service on a higher priority SNPN as specified in clause 4.9.3, with an exception that the current registered SNPN is considered as lowest priority. If the selected PLMN is a VPLMN or the selected SNPN is a non-subscribed SNPN and the UE has an established emergency PDU session then the UE shall attempt to perform the PLMN selection after the emergency PDU session is released and after the UE enters idle mode or 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]).\nNOTE 6:\tThe receipt of the steering of roaming information by itself does not trigger the release of the emergency PDU session.\nC.5\tStage-2 flow for steering of UE in SNPN during registration\nThe stage-2 flow for the case when the UE registers in a non-subscribed SNPN is described below in figure C.5.1.

As part of the registration procedure:\na)\tthe AMF provides the registration type to the UDM using Nudm_UECM_Registration. As a consequence, in case of the 5GS registration type message indicates \"initial registration\" or \"emergency registration\" the UDM shall delete the stored \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator, if any, and the stored \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI-LS\" indicator, if any, in UDR using Nudr_DM_Update service operation (see 3GPP TS 23.502 [63]).\nNOTE 1:\tNudr_DM_Update service operation corresponds to Nudr_DR_Update service operation (see 3GPP TS 29.504 [82] and 3GPP TS 29.505 [83]).\nIn addition:\na)\tif the AMF does not have subscription data for the UE, the AMF invokes Nudm_SDM_Get service operation to the UDM to get amongst other information the Access and Mobility Subscription data for the UE (see step 14b in clause 4.2.2.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [63]); or\nb)\tif the AMF already has subscription data for the UE and:\ni)\tthe 5GS registration type IE in the received REGISTRATION REQUEST message indicates \"initial registration\" and the \"SoR Update Indicator for Initial Registration\" field in the UE context is set to 'the UDM requests the AMF to retrieve SoR information when the UE performs NAS registration type \"initial registration\"' as specified in table 5.2.2.2.2-1 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [63]); or\nii)\tthe 5GS registration type IE in the received REGISTRATION REQUEST message indicates \"emergency registration\" and the \"SoR Update Indicator for Emergency Registration\" field in the UE context is set to 'the UDM requests the AMF to retrieve SoR information when the UE performs NAS registration type \"emergency registration\"' as specified in table 5.2.2.2.2-1 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [63]);\nthen the AMF invokes Nudm_SDM_Get service operation message to the UDM to retrieve the steering of roaming information (see step 14b in clause 4.2.2.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [63]);\notherwise the AMF sends a REGISTRATION ACCEPT message without the steering of roaming information to the UE and steps 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, 4, 5, 6 are skipped;\n3a)\tIf the UE is registering on a non-subscribed SNPN except if the UE supports equivalent SNPNs, the ME does not support SOR-SNPN-SI and the UE is in an equivalent SNPN of the subscribed SNPN,the UDM shall store the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI\" indicator.\nExcept if the UE supports equivalent SNPNs, the ME does not support SOR-SNPN-SI and the UE is in an equivalent SNPN of the subscribed SNPN:\na)\tif the user subscription information indicates to send the steering of roaming information due to initial registration in a non-subscribed SNPN, then when the UE performs initial registration in a non-subscribed SNPN, the UDM shall provide the steering of roaming information to the UE; and\nb)\totherwise, when the UE is registering on a non-subscribed SNPN, the UDM may provide the SOR-SNPN-SI to the UE based on the subscribed SNPN or HPLMN policy.\nIf the UDM is to provide the steering of roaming information to the UE when the UE performs the registration in a non-subscribed SNPN and the subscribed SNPN or HPLMN policy for the SOR-AF invocation is absent then steps 3b and 3c are not performed and the UDM obtains the available SOR-SNPN-SI (i.e. all retrieved from the UDR). In addition, if the UDM obtains the SOR-SNPN-SI and\n-\tthe \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator is stored for the UE, then the UDM shall obtain the SOR-CMCI, if available, otherwise the UDM shall not obtain the SOR-CMCI.

The AMF includes in the DL NAS TRANSPORT message the steering of roaming information received from the UDM.\n4)\tUpon receiving the steering of roaming information, the UE shall perform a security check on the steering of roaming information included in the DL NAS TRANSPORT message to verify that the steering of roaming information is provided by HPLMN, and:\na)\tif the security check is successful:\n-\tif the steering of roaming information contains a secured packet (see 3GPP TS 31.115 [67]) and the service \"data download via SMS Point-to-point\" is allocated and activated in the USIM Service Table (see 3GPP TS 31.102 [40]), the ME shall upload the secured packet to the USIM using procedures in 3GPP TS 31.111 [41]; and\n-\tif the steering of roaming information contains the list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations, the ME shall replace the highest priority entries in the \"Operator Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\" list stored in the ME with the received list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations, and delete the PLMNs identified by the list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations from the Forbidden PLMN list and from the Forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service list, if they are present in these lists.\nIf the UDM has requested an acknowledgement from the UE in the DL NAS TRANSPORT message, the UE sends an UL NAS TRANSPORT message to the serving AMF with an SOR transparent container including the UE acknowledgement and the UE shall set the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI\" indicator to \"supported\".\nIf the UDM has not requested an acknowledgement from the UE then step 5 is skipped; and\nb)\tif the security check is not successful and the UE is in automatic network selection mode, then:\n-\tif the UE has a stored SOR-CMCI, then:\n-\tif there are ongoing PDU sessions or services, the current SNPN is considered as lowest priority and the UE shall apply the actions in clause C.4.2;\n-\tif there are no ongoing PDU sessions or services, the UE shall release the current N1 NAS signalling connection locally and attempt to obtain service on a higher priority SNPN as specified in clause 4.9.3, with an exception that the current SNPN is considered as lowest priority;\n-\tif the UE does not have a SOR-CMCI stored in the non-volatile memory of the ME, then:\n-\tif there are ongoing PDU sessions or services, the UE shall wait until it moves to idle mode or 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]) before attempting to obtain service on a higher priority SNPN as specified in clause 4.9.3, with an exception that the current SNPN is considered as lowest priority. If the UE has an established emergency PDU session then the UE shall attempt to perform the SNPN selection after the emergency PDU session is released and after the UE enters idle mode or 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]); or\n-\tif there are no ongoing PDU sessions or services, the UE shall release the current N1 NAS signalling connection locally and attempt to obtain service on a higher priority SNPN as specified in clause 4.9.3, with an exception that the current SNPN is considered as lowest priority.\nStep 5 is skipped;\nNOTE 1:\tWhen the UE is in the manual mode of operation or the current chosen non-subscribed SNPN is part of the user controlled prioritized list of preferred SNPNs, the UE stays on current chosen non-subscribed SNPN.\n5)\tThe AMF to the UDM: If the UL NAS TRANSPORT message with an SOR transparent container is received, the AMF uses the Nudm_SDM_Info service operation to provide the received SOR transparent container to the UDM. If the HPLMN decided that the UE is to acknowledge successful security check of the received steering of roaming information in step 2, the UDM verifies that the acknowledgement is provided by the UE. The UDM shall store the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI\" indicator except if the UE supports equivalent SNPNs, the ME does not support SOR-SNPN-SI and the UE is in an equivalent SNPN of the subscribed SNPN.\nIf the present flow was invoked by the UDM after receiving from the SOR-AF a list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations or a secured packet for a UE identified by SUPI using an Nudm_ParameterProvision_Update request, and the UDM verification of the UE acknowledgement is successful, then the UDM informs the SOR-AF about successful delivery of the steering of roaming information using Nsoraf_SoR_Info (SUPI of the UE, successful delivery); and\n6)\tThe UDM to the SOR-AF: Nsoraf_SoR_Info (SUPI of the UE, successful delivery, \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI\" indicator, if any). If the HPLMN policy for the SOR-AF invocation is present and the HPLMN UDM received and verified the UE acknowledgement in step 5, then the UDM informs the SOR-AF about successful delivery of the steering of roaming information to the UE. If the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI\" indicator is stored for the UE, the UDM shall include the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI\" indicator.\nIf:\n-\tthe UE in manual mode of operation encounters security check failure of SOR information in DL NAS TRANSPORT message; and\n-\tupon switching to automatic network selection mode the UE remembers that it is still registered on non-subscribed SNPN where the security check failure of SOR information was encountered;\nthe UE shall wait until it moves to idle mode or 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]) before attempting to obtain service on a higher priority SNPN as specified in clause 4.9.3, with an exception that the current registered SNPN is considered as lowest priority. If the UE has an established emergency PDU session then the UE shall attempt to perform the SNPN selection after the emergency PDU session is released and after the UE enters idle mode or 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]).\nNOTE 2:\tThe receipt of the steering of roaming information by itself does not trigger the release of the emergency PDU session.\nAnnex D (informative):Change history\nTSG#\nTdoc\nSPEC\nVERS\nCR\nREV\nPHASE\nCAT\nN_VER\nSUBJECT\ncomment\n03.22\n8.2.0\nR99\nSplit of 03.22/R99 to 03.22 and
