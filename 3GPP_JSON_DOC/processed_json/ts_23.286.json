It utilizes the architectural reference model specified in clause 4.2 in 3GPP TS 23.285 [5] and clause 4.2 in 3GPP TS 23.287 [19] which have impact on the application layer support aspects.\nFigure 6.2-1: Simplified architectural model for the V2X application layer\nThe V2X UE1 communicates with V2X application server over V1 reference point. The V2X UE1 and V2X UE2 communicate over V5 reference point. V2X UE1 can also act as a UE-to-network relay, to enable V2X UE2 to access the V2X application server over V1 reference point.\nThe reference point V1 supports the V2X application related interactions between V2X UE and V2X AS and is specified in 3GPP TS 23.285 [5] and 3GPP TS 23.287 [19]. This reference point is supported for both unicast and multicast delivery modes. The reference point V5 supports the interactions between the V2X UEs and is specified in 3GPP TS 23.285 [5] and 3GPP TS 23.287 [19].\nFigure 6.2-2 illustrates the detailed V2X application layer functional model. It enhances the simplified architectural model for the V2X application layer by specifying the functional entities at the V2X application layer.\nFigure 6.2-2: V2X application layer functional model\nThe V2X application layer functional entities for the V2X UE and the V2X application server are grouped into the V2X application specific layer and the VAE layer. The VAE layer offers the VAE capabilities to the V2X application specific layer. The V2X application layer functional model utilizes the SEAL services as specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [6].\nThe VAE server is located in the VAE layer. The SEAL services utilized by VAE layer are location management, group management, configuration management, identity management, key management and network resource management. The V2X application specific layer consists of the V2X application specific functionalities.\nNOTE 1:\tThe functionalities of the V2X application specific layer are out of scope of the present document.\nThe V2X application server consists of the VAE server, the SEAL servers and the V2X application specific server. The VAE server provides the V2X application layer support functions to the V2X application specific server over Vs reference point. The SEAL server(s) provide the SEAL services to the V2X application specific server over SEAL‑S reference point.\nThe V2X UEs consist of the VAE client, the SEAL clients and the V2X application specific client. The VAE client provides the V2X application layer support functions to the V2X application specific client over Vc reference point. The SEAL client(s) provide the SEAL services to the V2X application specific client over SEAL‑C reference point.\nNOTE 2:\tIn some deployments, the client and server entities of SEAL can be part of VAE client and VAE server respectively.\nThe VAE client acts as a VAL client for its interaction with the SEAL clients as specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [6]. The VAE server acts as a VAL server for its interaction with the SEAL servers as specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [6].\nIn the VAE layer, the VAE client communicates with the VAE server over V1-AE reference point. In the V2X application specific layer, the V2X application specific client communicates with V2X application specific server over V1-APP reference point.\nNOTE 3:\tThe V1-APP reference point is out of scope of the present document.\nIn the VAE layer, the VAE client of V2X UE2 communicates with VAE client of V2X UE1 over V5-AE reference point. In the V2X application specific layer, the V2X application specific client of V2X UE2 communicates with VAE client of V2X UE1 over V5-APP reference point.\nNOTE 4:\tThe V5-APP reference point is out of scope of the present document.\nThe following SEAL services for V2X applications are supported:\n-\tLocation management as specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [6];\n-\tGroup management as specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [6];\n-\tConfiguration management as specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [6];\n-\tIdentity management as specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [6];\n-\tKey management as specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [6]; and\n-\tNetwork resource management as specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [6].\nThe VAE client interacts with SEAL clients over the SEAL-C reference point specified for each SEAL service. The VAE server interacts with SEAL servers over the SEAL-S reference point specified for each SEAL service. The interaction between the SEAL clients is supported by SEAL-PC5 reference point specified for each SEAL service. The interaction between a SEAL client and the corresponding SEAL server is supported by SEAL-UU reference point specified for each SEAL service.\nNOTE 5:\tThe SEAL-C, SEAL-S, SEAL-PC5, SEAL-UU reference points for each SEAL service is specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [6].\nTo support distributed VAE server deployments, the VAE server interacts with another VAE server over VAE-E reference point.\nV2X UE1 can also act as a UE-to-network relay,\n-\tto enable VAE client on V2X UE2 to access VAE server over V1-AE reference point; and\n-\tto enable V2X application specific client on V2X UE2 to access V2X application specific server over V1-APP reference point.\nA V1-AE message can be sent over unicast, transparent multicast via xMB, transparent multicast via MB2. The non-transparent multicast via xMB (as specified in 3GPP TS 26.348 [11]) is triggered by a V1-AE message. Multicast distribution can be supported by both transparent and non-transparent multicast modes.\nThe VAE server interacts with the 3GPP network system over V2, MB2, xMB, Rx, T8, N5 and N33 reference points.

The VAE server has subscribed to QoS notification service from 5GS (e.g. PCF/NWDAF). The notification may either include the request for QoS sustainability events as specified in 3GPP TS 23.288 [24] or can include a QoS change notification requests as provided by SMF and specified in 3GPP TS 23.287 [19];\n2.\tThe V2X UE1 and V2X UE2 have subscribed for the network monitoring information at the VAE server.\n3.\tThe VAE server may be aware of the RAT type the V2X UE supports from the registration of VAE client.\nFigure 9.7.4.2-1: Notifications for network monitoring information\n1.\tThe VAE server communicates with the SCEF to receive network monitoring information as per the procedure in subclause 4.9 of 3GPP TS 23.682 [8], and/or communicates with NEF or NWDAF to receive QoS monitoring information and/or data analytics information of 5GS as defined in 3GPP TS 23.288 [24] for the requesting area and/or the V2X UE(s). The VAE server may determine to receive network monitoring information from EPC or 5GC or both considering the RAT type provided by the UE. The VAE server subscription to QoS monitoring service from 5GS (e.g. PCF/NWDAF) may be active for a certain period of time or a given geographical area and/or the V2X UE(s). The monitoring may either include the request for QoS sustainability events as specified in 3GPP TS 23.288 [24], or can include a QoS change notification requests as provided by SMF and specified in 3GPP TS 23.287 [19]. The reporting may be configured by the application enabler layer for a given area, V2X UE(s), time, periodicity etc taking into account the service requirement and other parameters (e.g. expected congestion in certain area, time of the day, road conditions). Based on the subscription, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.287 [19], 5GS provides the extended QoS monitoring report, over N33 interface. This report may come either from NWDAF or SMF via PCF/NEF.\n2.\tThe network monitoring information (e.g. uplink or downlink link degradations, congestions, etc.) available at the VAE server about the on-going V2V session(s) and the network status is based on the original network monitoring information provided by the SCEF in step 1, and/or based on QoS monitoring report or data analytics from 5GS as specified in step 1. The VAE server determines the network monitoring information to send to the UE.\n3.\tThe monitoring information is sent to the subscribed V2X UEs via network monitoring information notification.",

      "content": "Vehicle to Pedestrian (V2P) is one of the V2X scenarios, which enables communication between vehicles and pedestrians for both safety and traffic efficiency related applications.  One of the key V2P applications is the Vulnerable Road User Protection (VRUP) as specified in ETSI TS 103 300-2 [13]. VRUP provides warning to vehicles of the presence of vulnerable road users, e.g. pedestrian or cyclist, in case of dangerous situation. In VRUP, multiple V2X messages need to be exchanged between the pedestrian and the vehicular UEs, originating by one or more applications. Such messages can be standard VRU messages (e.g. VAM) and other V2X messages (CAM, DENM, BSM, CPM) and can be exchanged via different transmission modes (unicast, groupcast, broadcast).\nIn such scenario, one challenge is that a pedestrian UE might have a lower battery capacity and limited radio capability, and therefore may have to work in a low power consumption mode, e.g. not being able to send/receive V2X messages with the same periodicity as a Vehicular UE. Continuous sending/receiving V2X messages by the pedestrian UE would affect UE power efficiency. A further challenge is that multiple applications related to VRU may be deployed, which may have differentiated traffic/QoS requirements as well as transmission/reception schedules.\nThe VAE layer may provide support functionality for enabling V2P applications, by consolidating the V2P application requirements and aligning the communication traffic pattern with the PC5 QoS setting and the AS layer configurations (e.g. DRX cycles).",

The V2X application layer functional model as specified in clause 6 may be deployed in edge computing environment.\nFigure D-1 illustrates a V2X application layer deployment in edge computing environments.\nFigure D-1: Utilization of edge computing\nFigure D-1 illustrates the utilization of edge computing for V2X application layer based on edge enabler layer specified in 3GPP TS 23.558 [25].\nAt UE side, V2X Application Specific client(s) and VAE client interact with the Edge Enabler Client (EEC) via EDGE‑5 reference point. In an Edge Data Network (EDN), V2X Application Specific Server and VAE server assume the role of EAS (Edge Application Server) and interacts with the Edge Enabler Server (EES) via EDGE-3 reference point, for instance, to register its profile into the EES. Upon service provisioning, the EEC interacts with the EES via EDGE-1 reference point, for instance, to discover V2X Application Specific Server(s) and VAE Server and further the EEC provides the discovered V2X Application Specific Server(s) and VAE server to the V2X Application Specific client and VAE client respectively. The interactions between the entities and 5GS are not shown for the sake of simplicity.\nIn an EDN, there could be several EES(s) provided by the same or different ECSP. The V2X application specific server(s), VAE server(s) and SEAL servers (e.g. GMS, NRMS, ADAES) shall be able to discover and register into an appropriate EES. If CAPIF is used, this can be done by utilizing the AEF serving area and/or the AEF location as described in 3GPP TS 23.222 [21]; otherwise, local configuration of the EES endpoint may be used.\nThe services provided by EES over EDGE-3 are not re-exposed by the VAE server or SEAL servers to the V2X application specific server but are directly consumed by the SEAL servers, VAE server and V2X application specific server(s).\nNOTE:\tThis clause illustrates an example edge deployment using edge enabler layer and there can be other valid edge deployments enabled for V2X application layer.\nAnnex E:Change history\nChange history\nDate\nMeeting\nTDoc\nCR\nRev\nCat\nSubject/Comment\nNew version\n2018-10\nSA6#26\nTS skeleton\n0.0.0\n2018-10\nSA6#26\nImplementation of the following
