The following types are supported:\n-\tCurrent geographic location estimate\n-\tLocation assistance data for the target UE\n-\tLast known location estimate\nIf the location estimate is requested, the E-SMLC performs positioning procedure on the target UE using a particular position method or a combination of more than one positioning method based on the UE capability. If UE capability is unknown, the E-SMLC may request UE position capability through LPP as defined in 3GPP TS 36.305 [2]. If the location estimate is requested and the UE Country Determination Indication is set to \"required\", the E-SMLC shall map the location estimate to the country or the area in the country or international area.\nAlternatively, if assistance data was requested, the E-SMLC may provide positioning assistance data to the UE. The E-SMLC may invoke the following LCS-AP procedures to get assistance data:\n-\tConnection Oriented Information Transfer\n-\tConnectionless Information Transfer\nOtherwise, if a last known location estimate is requested, the E-SMLC obtains a geographic location estimate using only the information provided in the LCS-AP Location Request message. The E-SMLC shall not attempt to obtain location information for the target UE from either the E-UTRAN or the target UE (e.g. because the UE may not be currently reachable).\nIf a location estimate or a last known location estimate was requested and was subsequently obtained, the E-SMLC shall return a LCS-AP Location Response to the initiator of the location request using the same SCTP association as the location request.

If one IE needed to appear more than once in one object set, then the different occurrences have different IE ids):\n-\tIEs shall be ordered (in an IE container) in the order they appear in object set definitions.\n-\tObject set definitions specify how many times IEs may appear. An IE shall appear exactly once if the presence field in an object has value \"mandatory\". An IE may appear at most once if the presence field in an object has value \"optional\" or \"conditional\". If in a tabular format there is multiplicity specified for an IE (i.e. an IE list) then in the corresponding ASN.1 definition the list definition is separated into two parts. The first part defines an IE container list where the list elements reside. The second part defines list elements. The IE container list appears as an IE of its own. For this version of the standard an IE container list may contain only one kind of list elements.\nIf a LCS-AP message that is not constructed as defined above is received, this shall be considered as Abstract Syntax Error, and the message shall be handled as defined for Abstract Syntax error.\nFor the handling of unknown, unforeseen and erroneous protocol data, please refer to 3GPP TS 36.413 [7].",
