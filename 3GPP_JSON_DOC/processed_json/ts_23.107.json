The UMTS Bearer Service consists of two parts, the Radio Access Bearer Service and the Core Network Bearer Service. Both services reflects the optimised way to realise the UMTS Bearer Service over the respective cellular network topology taking into account such aspects as e.g. mobility and mobile subscriber profiles.\nThe Radio Access Bearer Service provides confidential transport of signalling and user data between MT and CN Edge Node with the QoS adequate to the negotiated UMTS Bearer Service or with the default QoS for signalling. This service is based on the characteristics of the radio interface and is maintained for a moving MT.\nIf unequal error protection shall be supported, it is provided by underlying Radio Bearer Services. In this case the payload of the user data SDU, transported by the Radio Access Bearer Service, shall conform to a SDU format defined with possible exact sizes and the payload bits statically structured per size. Each bit of the SDU payload belongs to a defined subflow. At Radio Access Bearer Service establishment, the exact SDU payload format and required reliability per subflow is signalled to RAN using standardised attributes (see clause 6.4.3).\nIn release 1999, unequal error protection for a Radio Access Bearer is only applicable for services using a codec integrated in the core network. This implies that UMTS Bearer service can not use the attribute SDU format information to define subflows and the payload bits of the SDUs will therefore be equally protected.\nThe Core Network Bearer Service of the UMTS core network connects the UMTS CN Edge Node with the CN Gateway to the external network. The role of this service is to efficiently control and utilise the backbone network in order to provide the contracted UMTS bearer service.

      "content": "When defining the UMTS QoS classes, also referred to as traffic classes, the restrictions and limitations of the air interface have to be taken into account. It is not reasonable to define complex mechanisms as have been in fixed networks due to different error characteristics of the air interface. The QoS mechanisms provided in the cellular network have to be robust and capable of providing reasonable QoS resolution. Table 1 illustrates the QoS classes for UMTS.\nThere are four different QoS classes:\n-\tconversational class;\n-\tstreaming class;\n-\tinteractive class; and\n-\tbackground class.\nThe main distinguishing factor between these QoS classes is how delay sensitive the traffic is: Conversational class is meant for traffic which is very delay sensitive while Background class is the most delay insensitive traffic class.\nConversational and Streaming classes are mainly intended to be used to carry real-time traffic flows. The main divider between them is how delay sensitive the traffic is. Conversational real-time services, like video telephony, are the most delay sensitive applications and those data streams should be carried in Conversational class.\nInteractive class and Background are mainly meant to be used by traditional Internet applications like WWW, Email, Telnet, FTP and News. Due to looser delay requirements, compare to conversational and streaming classes, both provide better error rate by means of channel coding and retransmission. The main difference between Interactive and Background class is that Interactive class is mainly used by interactive applications, e.g. interactive Email or interactive Web browsing, while Background class is meant for background traffic, e.g. background download of Emails or background file downloading. Responsiveness of the interactive applications is ensured by separating interactive and background applications. Traffic in the Interactive class has higher priority in scheduling than Background class traffic, so background applications use transmission resources only when interactive applications do not need them. This is very important in wireless environment where the bandwidth is low compared to fixed networks.\nHowever, these are only typical examples of usage of the traffic classes. There is in particular no strict one-to-one mapping between classes of service (as defined in TS 22.105 [5]) and the traffic classes defined in this TS. For instance, a service interactive by nature can very well use the Conversational traffic class if the application or the user has tight requirements on delay.",

      "content": "The most well known use of this scheme is telephony speech (e.g. GSM). But with Internet and multimedia a number of new applications will require this scheme, for example voice over IP and video conferencing tools. Real time conversation is always performed between peers (or groups) of live (human) end-users. This is the only scheme where the required characteristics are strictly given by human perception.\nReal time conversation scheme is characterised by that the transfer time shall be low because of the conversational nature of the scheme and at the same time that the time relation (variation) between information entities of the stream shall be preserved in the same way as for real time streams. The maximum transfer delay is given by the human perception of video and audio conversation. Therefore the limit for acceptable transfer delay is very strict, as failure to provide low enough transfer delay will result in unacceptable lack of quality. The transfer delay requirement is therefore both significantly lower and more stringent than the round trip delay of the interactive traffic case.\nReal time conversation - fundamental characteristics for QoS:\n-\tpreserve time relation (variation) between information entities of the stream;\n-\tconversational pattern (stringent and low delay).",

It is characterised by that the time relations (variation) between information entities (i.e. samples, packets) within a flow shall be preserved, although it does not have any requirements on low transfer delay.\nThe delay variation of the end-to-end flow shall be limited, to preserve the time relation (variation) between information entities of the stream. But as the stream normally is time aligned at the receiving end (in the user equipment), the highest acceptable delay variation over the transmission media is given by the capability of the time alignment function of the application.

The traffic is conformant with Maximum bitrate as long as it follows a token bucket algorithm where token rate equals Maximum bitrate and bucket size equals Maximum SDU size.\nThe conformance definition should not be interpreted as a required implementation algorithm. The token bucket algorithm is described in annex B.\nThe Maximum bitrate is the upper limit a user or application can accept or provide. All UMTS bearer service attributes may be fulfilled for traffic up to the Maximum bitrate depending on the network conditions.\n[Purpose:\tMaximum bitrate can be used to make code reservations in the downlink of the radio interface. Its purpose is 1) to limit the delivered bitrate to applications or external networks with such limitations 2) to allow maximum wanted user bitrate to be defined for applications able to operate with different rates (e.g. applications with adapting codecs).]\nGuaranteed bitrate (kbps)\nDefinition: guaranteed number of bits delivered by UMTS at a SAP within a period of time (provided that there is data to deliver), divided by the duration of the period. The traffic is conformant with the guaranteed bitrate as long as it follows a token bucket algorithm where token rate equals Guaranteed bitrate and bucket size equals Maximum SDU size.\nThe conformance definition should not be interpreted as a required implementation algorithm. The token bucket algorithm is described in annex B.\nUMTS bearer service attributes, e.g. delay and reliability attributes, are guaranteed for traffic up to the Guaranteed bitrate. For the traffic exceeding the Guaranteed bitrate the UMTS bearer service attributes are not guaranteed.\n[Purpose:\tDescribes the bitrate the UMTS bearer service shall guarantee to the user or application. Guaranteed bitrate may be used to facilitate admission control based on available resources, and for resource allocation within UMTS.]\nDelivery order (y/n)\nDefinition: indicates whether the UMTS bearer shall provide in-sequence SDU delivery or not.\n[Purpose:\tthe attribute is derived from the user protocol (PDP type) and specifies if out-of-sequence SDUs are acceptable or not. This information cannot be extracted from the traffic class. Whether out-of-sequence SDUs are dropped or re-ordered depends on the specified reliability]\nDelivery order should be set to 'no' for PDP Type = 'IPv4' or 'IPv6'. The SGSN shall ensure that the appropriate value is set.\nMaximum SDU size (octets)\nDefinition: the maximum SDU size for which the network shall satisfy the negotiated QoS.\n[Purpose:\tThe maximum SDU size is used for admission control and policing and/or optimising transport (optimized transport in for example the RAN may be dependent on the size of the packets). Handling by the network of packets larger than Maximum SDU size is implementation specific (e.g. they may be dropped or forwarded with decreased QoS).]\nNOTE:\tThe Maximum Transfer Unit (MTU) of the IP layer and the Maximum SDU Size have no relationship; in particular the GGSN should not perform IP fragmentation based on the Maximum SDU Size.\nSDU format information (bits)\nDefinition: list of possible exact sizes of SDUs\n[Purpose:\tRAN needs SDU size information to be able to operate in transparent RLC protocol mode, which is beneficial to spectral efficiency and delay when RLC re-transmission is not used. Thus, if the application can specify SDU sizes, the bearer is less expensive.]\nSDU error ratio\nDefinition: Indicates the fraction of SDUs lost or detected as erroneous. SDU error ratio is defined only for conforming traffic.\nNOTE 1:\tBy reserving resources, SDU error ratio performance is independent of the loading conditions, whereas without reserved resources, such as in Interactive and Background classes, SDU error ratio is used as target value.\n[Purpose:\tUsed to configure the protocols, algorithms and error detection schemes, primarily within RAN.]\nResidual bit error ratio\nDefinition: Indicates the undetected bit error ratio in the delivered SDUs. If no error detection is requested, Residual bit error ratio indicates the bit error ratio in the delivered SDUs.\n[Purpose:\tUsed to configure radio interface protocols, algorithms and error detection coding.]\nDelivery of erroneous SDUs (y/n/-)\nDefinition: Indicates whether SDUs detected as erroneous shall be delivered or discarded.\nNOTE 2:\t'yes' implies that error detection is employed and that erroneous SDUs are delivered together with an error indication, 'no' implies that error detection is employed and that erroneous SDUs are discarded, and '-' implies that SDUs are delivered without considering error detection.\n[Purpose:\tUsed to decide whether error detection is needed and whether frames with detected errors shall be forwarded or not.]\nTransfer delay (ms)\nDefinition: Indicates maximum delay for 95th percentile of the distribution of delay for all delivered SDUs during the lifetime of a bearer service, where delay for an SDU is defined as the time from a request to transfer an SDU at one SAP to its delivery at the other SAP.\n[Purpose:\trelates to the delay tolerated by the application. In conjunction with the SDU error ratio attribute, care needs to be taken in deriving the value for the 95th percentile when an application desires, for example, that 99.9% of all transmitted packets are delivered within a certain time. This attribute allows RAN to set transport formats and ARQ parameters.]\nNOTE 3:\tTransfer delay of an arbitrary SDU is not meaningful for a bursty source, since the last SDUs of a burst may have long delay due to queuing, whereas the meaningful response delay perceived by the user is the delay of the first SDU of the burst.\nTraffic handling priority\nDefinition: specifies the relative importance for handling of all SDUs belonging to the UMTS bearer compared to the SDUs of other bearers.\n[Purpose:\tWithin the interactive class, there is a definite need to differentiate between bearer qualities. This is handled by using the traffic handling priority attribute, to allow UMTS to schedule traffic accordingly. By definition, priority is an alternative to absolute guarantees, and thus these two attribute types cannot be used together for a single bearer.]\nAllocation/Retention Priority\nDefinition: specifies the relative importance compared to other UMTS bearers for allocation and retention of the UMTS bearer. The Allocation/Retention Priority attribute is a subscription attribute which is not negotiated from the mobile terminal, but the value might be changed either by the SGSN or the GGSN network element.\nNOTE 4:\tThe addition of a user-controlled Allocation/Retention Priority attribute is for further study in future releases.\n[Purpose:\tPriority is used for differentiating between bearers when performing allocation and retention of a bearer. In situations where resources are scarce, the relevant network elements can use the Allocation/Retention Priority to prioritize bearers with a high Allocation/Retention Priority over bearers with a low Allocation/Retention Priority when performing admission control.]\nSource statistics descriptor ('speech'/'unknown')\nDefinition: specifies characteristics of the source of submitted SDUs.\nEditor's note:\tThe number of different source statistics descriptors that should be allowed is FFS.\n[Purpose:\tConversational speech has a well-known statistical behaviour (or the discontinuous transmission (DTX) factor). By being informed that the SDUs for a UMTS bearer are generated by a speech source, RAN, the SGSN and the GGSN and also the UE may, based on experience, calculate a statistical multiplex gain for use in admission control on the relevant interfaces.]\nSignalling Indication (Yes/No)\nDefinition: Indicates the signalling nature of the submitted SDUs. This attribute is additional to the other QoS attributes and does not over-ride them. This attribute is only defined for the interactive traffic class. If signalling indication is set to 'Yes', the UE should set the traffic handling priority to '1'.\n[Purpose:\tSignalling traffic can have different characteristics to other interactive traffic, e.g. higher priority, lower delay and increased peakiness. This attribute permits enhancing the RAN operation accordingly. An example use of the Signalling Indication is for IMS signalling traffic.]\nNOTE:\tThis indication is sent by the UE in the QoS IE.\nEvolved Allocation/Retention Priority\nDefinition: Enhances the Allocation/Retention Priority attribute with an increased value range of the priority level and additional information about the pre-emption capability and the pre-emption vulnerability of the bearer. The pre-emption capability information defines whether a bearer with a lower priority level should be dropped to free up the required resources. The pre-emption vulnerability information whether a bearer is applicable for such dropping by a pre-emption capable bearer with a higher priority value.",

      "content": "Conversational class\nIf the UMTS bearer carries speech service, Source statistics descriptor can be set, which allows UMTS to calculate a statistical multiplexing gain in core network, RAN and UE and use that for admission control.\nThe support for SRVCC requires conversational class and Source statistics descriptor set to speech only be used for IMS speech sessions in accordance to TS 23.216 [11].\nNOTE:\tTriggering SRVCC will cause service interruption and/or inconsistent service experience when using conversational class and Source statistics descriptor set to speech for non-IMS services.\nAlthough the bitrate of a conversational source codec may vary, conversational traffic is assumed to be relatively non‑bursty. Maximum bitrate specifies the upper limit of the bitrate with which the UMTS bearer delivers SDUs at the SAPs. The UMTS bearer is not required to transfer traffic exceeding the Guaranteed bitrate. Maximum and guaranteed bitrate attributes are used for resource allocation within UMTS. Minimum resource requirement is determined by guaranteed bitrate (When a conversational source generates less traffic than allocated for the bearer, the unused resources can of course be used by other bearers).\nSince the traffic is non-bursty, it is meaningful to guarantee a transfer delay of an arbitrary SDU.\nConversational bearers are likely to be realised in RAN without RLC re-transmissions. Hence, RAN transport is more efficient and thereby cheaper if RLC PDU size is adapted to UMTS bearer SDU size (RLC transparent mode). This motivates the use of SDU format information. The SDU periodicity knowledge needed to operate in RLC transparent mode is obtained through dividing the largest defined SDU format by Maximum bitrate. This shall be considered when setting the attribute values in a service request.\nThe Maximum SDU size is only applicable if SDU format information is not specified and is used for admission control and policing and/or optimising transport. If Maximum SDU size is specified the SDU size is variable. If SDU format information is specified, with one or several possible sizes, each SDU shall exactly conform to one of the specified sizes. By using the SDU error ratio, Residual bit error ratio and Delivery of erroneous SDUs attribute, the application requirement on error rate can be specified, as well as whether the application wants UMTS to detect and discard SDUs containing errors and an adequate forward error correction means can be selected.\nStreaming class\nIf the UMTS bearer carries streaming speech service, Source statistics descriptor can be set, which allows UMTS to calculate a statistical multiplexing gain in core network, RAN and UE and use that for admission control.\nAs for conversational class, streaming traffic is assumed to be rather non-bursty. Maximum bitrate specifies the upper limit of the bitrate the UMTS bearer delivers SDUs at the SAPs. The UMTS bearer is not required to transfer traffic exceeding the Guaranteed bitrate. Maximum and guaranteed bitrate attributes are used for resource allocation within UMTS. Minimum resource requirement is determined by guaranteed bitrate. (When a streaming source generates less traffic than allocated for the bearer, the unused resources can of course be used by other bearers.)\nSince the traffic is non-bursty, it is meaningful to guarantee a transfer delay of an arbitrary SDU.\nThe transfer delay requirements for streaming are typically in a range where at least in a part of this range RLC re‑transmission may be used. It is assumed that the application's requirement on delay variation is expressed through the transfer delay attribute, which implies that there is no need for an explicit delay variation attribute.\nIt shall be possible for Streaming bearers to be realised in RAN without RLC re-transmissions. Hence, RAN transport is more efficient and thereby cheaper if RLC PDU size is adapted to UMTS bearer SDU size (RLC transparent mode). This motivates the use of SDU format information. The SDU periodicity knowledge needed to operate in RLC transparent mode is obtained through dividing the largest defined SDU format by Maximum bitrate. This shall be considered when setting the attribute values in a service request.\nThe Maximum SDU size is only applicable if SDU format information is not specified and is used for admission control and policing and/or optimising transport. If Maximum SDU size is specified the SDU size is variable. If SDU format information is specified, with one or several possible sizes, each SDU shall exactly conform to one of the specified sizes.\nBy using the SDU error ratio, Residual bit error ratio and Delivery of erroneous SDUs attribute, the application requirement on error rate can be specified, as well as whether the application wants UMTS to detect and discard SDUs containing errors.\nInteractive class\nThis bearer class is optimised for transport of human or machine interaction with remote equipment, such as web browsing. The source characteristics are unknown but may be bursty.\nTo be able to limit the delivered data rate for applications and external networks by traffic conditioning, maximum bitrate is included.\nThere is a definite need to differentiate between quality for bearers within the interactive class. One alternative would be to set absolute guarantees on delay, bitrate etc, which however at present seems complex to implement within RAN/CN. Instead, traffic handling priority is used. SDUs of a UMTS bearer with higher traffic handling priority is given priority over SDUs of other bearers within the interactive class, through UMTS-internal scheduling.\nIt is principally impossible to combine this relative approach with attributes specifying delay, bitrate, packet loss etc, so an interactive bearer gives no quality guarantees, and the actual bearer quality will depend on the load of the system and the admission control policy of the network operator.\nThe only additional attribute that is reasonable to specify is the bit integrity of the delivered data, which is given by SDU error ratio, Residual bit error ratio and Delivery of erroneous SDUs. Because there are no reserved resources for interactive class, SDU error ratio should be used as a target value. SDU error ratio cannot be guaranteed under abnormal load conditions.\nIf the Signalling Indication is set, a statistical multiplexing gain and/or improvements in signalling speed may be obtained within the UTRAN.\nBackground class\nThe background class is optimised for machine-to-machine communication that is not delay sensitive, such as messaging services. Background applications tolerate a higher delay than applications using the interactive class, which is the main difference between the background and interactive classes.\nUMTS only transfers background class SDUs when there is definite spare capacity in the network. To be able to limit the delivered data rate for applications and external networks by traffic conditioning, maximum bitrate is included.\nNo other guarantee than bit integrity in the delivered data, given by SDU error ratio, Residual bit error ratio and Delivery of erroneous SDUs , is needed. Because there are no reserved resources for background class, SDU error ratio should be used as a target value. SDU error ratio cannot be guaranteed under abnormal load conditions.",

Guaranteed bitrate may be used to facilitate admission control based on available resources, and for resource allocation within RAN.. The guaranteed bitrate at the RAB level may be different from that on UMTS bearer level, for example due to header compression.]\nDelivery order (y/n)\nDefinition: indicates whether the UMTS bearer shall provide in-sequence SDU delivery or not.\n[Purpose:\tspecifies if out-of-sequence SDUs are acceptable or not.

If unequal error protection shall be used by a Radio Access Bearer service, SDU format information defines the exact subflow format of the SDU payload. SDU format information also supports definition of allowed subflow bitrates.\nNOTE 1:\tSDU format information is used by RAN to define which bits of the payload that belongs to each subflow. Exact syntax of SDU format information attribute is the task of RAN WG3.\n[Purpose:\tRAN needs SDU format information to be able to operate in transparent RLC protocol mode, which is beneficial to spectral efficiency and delay when RLC re-transmission is not used. Thus, if the application can specify SDU sizes, the bearer is less expensive. Moreover, in case of unequal error protection, RAN needs to know the exact format of SDU payload to be able to demultiplex the SDU onto different radio bearer services. When rate control is applied to services having a constant SDU size, e.g. CS data, the subflow bitrate is used to calculate the allowed inter PDU transmission interval (IPTI).]\nSDU error ratio\nDefinition: Indicates the fraction of SDUs lost or detected as erroneous. SDU error ratio is defined only for conforming traffic. In case of unequal error protection., SDU error ratio is set per subflow and represents the error ratio in each subflow.

For equal error protection, only one value is needed. If no error detection is requested for a subflow, Residual bit error ratio indicates the bit error ratio in that subflow of the delivered SDUs.\n[Purpose:\tUsed to configure radio interface protocols, algorithms and error detection coding. For services requiring unequal error protection, residual bit error ratio is given for each subflow.]\nDelivery of erroneous SDUs (y/n/-)\nDefinition: Indicates whether SDUs with detected errors shall be delivered or not. In case of unequal error protection, the attribute is set per subflow.\nNOTE 3:\t'yes' implies that error detection is employed and that erroneous SDUs are delivered together with an error indication, 'no' implies that error detection is employed and that erroneous SDUs are discarded, and '-' implies that SDUs are delivered without considering error detection.\nIn case of unequal protection, different subflows may have different settings. Whenever there is a detected error in a subflow with 'no', the SDU is discarded, irrespective of settings in other subflows. For an SDU with multiple subflows with a 'yes' setting, there may be one error indication per subflow, or, if there is only one error indication per SDU, it indicates that an error was detected in at least one of these subflows. Exact definitions are the task of RAN3.\n[Purpose:\tUsed to decide whether error detection is needed and whether frames with detected errors shall be forwarded or discarded.]\nTransfer delay (ms)\nDefinition: Indicates maximum delay for 95th percentile of the distribution of delay for all delivered SDUs during the lifetime of a bearer service, where delay for an SDU is defined as the time from a request to transfer an SDU at one SAP to its delivery at the other SAP.\n[Purpose:\tpermits the derivation of the RAN part of the total transfer delay for the UMTS bearer. In conjunction with the SDU error ratio attribute, care needs to be taken in deriving the value for the 95th percentile when an application desires, for example, that 99.9% of all transmitted packets are delivered within a certain time. This attribute allows RAN to set transport formats and ARQ parameters.]\nTraffic handling priority\nDefinition: specifies the relative importance for handling of all SDUs belonging to the radio access bearer compared to the SDUs of other bearers.\n[Purpose:\tWithin the interactive class, there is a definite need to differentiate between bearer qualities. This is handled by using the traffic handling priority attribute, to allow RAN to schedule traffic accordingly. By definition, priority is an alternative to absolute guarantees, and thus these two attribute types cannot be used together for a single bearer.]\nAllocation/Retention Priority\nDefinition: specifies the relative importance compared to other Radio access bearers for allocation and retention of the Radio access bearer. For PS services the Allocation/Retention Priority attribute of the Radio access bearer is derived from the UMTS bearer service attributes Allocation/Retention Priority. Other attributes may be used in addition. For CS services the Allocation/Retention Priority attribute of the Radio access bearer is derived from the eMLPP priority level attribute (TS 23.067 [9]) and/or the CS Allocation/Retention Priority attribute (TS 23.008 [8]) and/or the Mobile Station Category attribute (TS 23.008 [8]) (which is only available for subscribers in their home PLMN). Other attributes may be used in addition.\nNOTE 4:\tThe parameter is not negotiated from the mobile terminal. The addition of a user-controlled Allocation/Retention Priority attribute is for further study in future releases.\n[Purpose:\tPriority is used for differentiating between bearers when performing allocation and retention of a bearer. In situations where resources are scarce, the relevant network elements can use the Allocation/Retention Priority to prioritize bearers with a high Allocation/Retention Priority over bearers with a low Allocation/Retention Priority when performing admission control.]\nSource statistics descriptor ('speech'/'unknown')\nDefinition: specifies characteristics of the source of submitted SDUs.\n[Purpose:\tConversational speech has a well-known statistical behaviour (or the discontinuous transmission (DTX) factor). By being informed that the SDUs for a RAB are generated by a speech source, RAN may, based on experience, calculate a statistical multiplex gain for use in admission control on the radio and RAN Access interfaces.]\nSignalling Indication (Yes/No)\nDefinition: Indicates the signalling nature of the submitted SDUs. This attribute is additional to the other QoS attributes and does not over-ride them.\n[Purpose:\tSignalling traffic can have different characteristics to other interactive traffic, e.g. higher priority, lower delay and increased peakiness. This attribute permits enhancing the RAN operation accordingly. An example use of the Signalling Indication is for IMS signalling traffic. ]",

In addition to these, there are cases when mapping of QoS attributes are needed internal to a node.\nGPRS Release 99 (R99) QoS attributes shall be equivalent to the UMTS QoS Attributes. For interworking purposes between different releases, mapping rules between GPRS Release 97/98 (R97/98) and GPRS Release 99 (R99) as well as UMTS are defined. Mapping shall occur whenever the UE, the SGSN, the GGSN and the HLR nodes are of different releases R97/98 or R99. The mapping is required in PDP context activation and modification procedures and when a R99 HLR Insert Subscriber Data towards a R97/98 SGSN.\nIt is not within the scope of the present document to determine if any value combinations of attribute values can not be supported. This means that complete mapping rules are defined here, and if the user requests a QoS profile which the network is not able to support (e.g. a low delay and a high reliability), the decision if such a attribute combination can be supported is left to admission control functionality within the PDP context activation procedure, and the QoS for such a profile may be renegotiated by the network based on the available resources.\nThe overall principle for the mapping between two profiles is that the two profiles, applied in their respective network releases, give the same or at least similar QoS. The GPRS R97/98 equipment will not be able to provide realtime service corresponding to the R99 conversational and streaming traffic classes. Therefore, the mapping is always to the non-realtime interactive and background traffic classes.\nThe R97/R98 QoS attributes are described in TS 03.60 Release 1998 [10].",

Internet applications do not directly use the services of UMTS but they use Internet QoS definitions and attributes, which are mapped to UMTS QoS attributes at API.

The mapping between Internet QoS and UMTS QoS is presented in following clause.\nIP based QoS models shall be supported for PDP contexts, meaning both Integrated Services (IntServ) signalled by RSVP [RFC 2205] and Differentiated Services (6-bit QoS attribute on each IP packet, DiffServ).

The way application level QoS and UMTS level QoS interact is detailed in TS 23.207 [7].\nAnnex A (informative):Error resilience in real-time packet multimedia payloads\nA.1\tIntroduction\nThis annex provides some basic information with respect to the error resilience of different encoded media streams when considering the support of unequal error protection for real-time packet multimedia services. It provides some indicative figures for the residual bit error rates that could be tolerated by audio-visual H.323 payloads in a 3G environment.\nH.323 employs the H.225.0 packetisation scheme, which in turn uses UDP/IP and RTP to transport each media stream. The structure of an H.323 packet is shown in figure A.1.\nFigure A.1: Structure of H.323 packet\nFigure A.2: Structure of compressed H.323 packet. Class 1 bits can tolerate medium BER; Class 2 bits can tolerate high BER\nIt is assumed that some elements of the H.323 header information, which comprises the IP, UDP and RTP headers, can be compressed. It is also assumed that this information will require reliable transmission, such that any errors in the header will result in the loss of the complete H.323 packet. However, for real-time multimedia streams that cannot accommodate a large delay (and therefore packet retransmission), codecs can be used that are tolerant to residual bit errors.\nThis annex highlights the error resilience of audio and visual codecs, and provide some example tolerance figures for media streams of the type that are likely to comprise H.323 payloads.\nA.1.1\tFactors affecting error resilience\nSpecific error resilience figures will depend on a number of factors, including:\n-\tthe media type;\n-\tthe quality of service (QoS) required;\n-\tthe specific codec used.\nMedia streams may also be sub-divided into different classes on the basis of bit error sensitivity as shown in figure A.2. In some cases the most sensitive bits may be protected by in-band checksum information. It should also be noted that, in addition to the effect of residual bit errors in the media stream, the QoS will be further degraded by packet loss due to errors in the H.323 header.\nA.2\tExample figures\nThe following values are indicative of the QoS attributes required by audio and video media streams, including bit error rates (BER) and frame erasure rates (FER).\nFor the purposes of example, figures are provided for the AMR speech codec and the MPEG-4 video codec.\nAMR speech codec payload\nBit rate:\t4,75 - 12,2 kbit/s\nDelay:\tend-to-end delay not to exceed 100ms (codec frame length is 20ms)\nBER:\t10-4 for Class 1 bits\n10-3 for Class 2 bits\nfor some applications, a higher BER class (~10-2) might be feasible.\nFER\t< 0,5% (with graceful degradation for higher erasure rates)\nMPEG-4 video payload:\nBit rate:\tvariable, average rate scalable from 24 to 128 kbit/s and higher\nDelay:\tend-to-end delay between 150 and 400ms\nvideo codec delay is typically less than 200 ms\nBER:\t10-6 - no visible degradation\n10-5 - little visible degradation\n10-4 - some visible artefacts\n> 10-3 - limited practical application\nPacket loss rate FFS\nData and control:\nData (data refers to other types than audio and video e.g. file transfers, shared whiteboard) and control information shall be transmitted reliably (i.e. residual bit errors should result in a lost packet).\nAnnex B (normative):Reference Algorithm for Conformance Definition of Bitrate\nThe annex shows a reference algorithm for the conformance definition of bitrate. This may be used for traffic contract between UMTS bearers and external network/user equipment. It should be noted that the reference algorithm will never imply a particular implementation for the traffic conditioner.\nThe algorithm is well known as \"Token Bucket Algorithm\" which has been described in IETF. Here, \"tokens\" represents the allowed data volume, for example in byte. \"Tokens\" are given at a constant \"token rate\" by a traffic contract, are stored temporarily in a \"token bucket\", and are consumed by accepting the packet. This algorithm uses the following two parameters (r and b) for the traffic contract and one variable (TBC) for the internal usage.\n-\tr: token rate, (corresponds to the monitored Maximum bitrate/Guaranteed bitrate).\n-\tb: bucket size, (the upper bound of TBC, corresponds to bounded burst size).\n-\tTBC(Token bucket counter): the number of given/remained tokens at any time.\nIn words, conformance according to a token bucket can be defined as: \"Data is conformant if the amount of data submitted during any arbitrarily chosen time period T does not exceed (b+rT)\".\nThe algorithm is described in the following.\nToken bucket counter (TBC) is usually increased by \"r\" in each small time unit. However, TBC has upper bound \"b\" and the value of TBC shall never exceed \"b\".\nWhen a packet #i with length Li arrives, the receiver checks the current TBC. If the TBC value is equal to or larger than Li, the packet arrival is judged compliant, i.e., the traffic is conformant. At this moment tokens corresponding to the packet length is consumed, and TBC value decreases by Li.\nWhen a packet #j with length Lj arrives, if TBC is less than Lj, the packet arrival is non-compliant, i.e., the traffic is not conformant. In this case, the value of TBC is not updated.\nFigure B.1: Operation example of the reference conformance algorithm\nAnnex C (normative):Determine which QoS profile is of highest QoS\nIn handovers from Release 1999 to GPRS Release 97/98 networks, it will be necessary to determine which PDP context of a set of PDP contexts provides the highest QoS, since, of a set of PDP contexts with the same APN and PDP address, all PDP contexts except the one with the highest QoS profile will be deactivated.\nTo determine which PDP context that has the highest QoS table C.1 is used. Only the PDP context(s) with the highest QoS ranking will be maintained and the rest will be deactivated. In a second step, if more than one PDP context remain, the PDP context with the highest value for the maximum bitrate attributes for downlink or uplink is selected. All PDP contexts except the PDP context(s) with the highest Maximum bitrate selected will be deactivated.\nIf more than one PDP context remain after the second step, all PDP contexts except that with the lowest NSAPI are deactivated.\nTable C.1\nQoS ranking\nTraffic class\nTraffic handling priority\n1\nInteractive\n1\n2\nconversational\nNot applicable\n3\nstreaming\nNot applicable\n4\nInteractive\n2\n5\nInteractive\n3\n6\nBackground\nNot applicable\nAnnex D (normative):Determine Traffic Class weights in HLR QoS profile\nThe QoS profile in the subscription record represents the maximum QoS per PDP context to the associated APN. Subsequently, it shall be possible to negotiate all QoS parameters, including an appropriate Traffic Class for each QoS flow. This is valid for the first PDP context that is established as well as subsequent PDP contexts, i.e. this includes primary and secondary PDP contexts activations.
