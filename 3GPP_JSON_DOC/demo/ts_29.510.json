      "content": "The services operations defined for the Nnrf_NFManagement service are as follows:\n-\tNFRegister: It allows an NF, SCP or SEPP Instance to register its profile in the NRF; it includes the registration of the general parameters of the NF, SCP or SEPP Instance, together with the list of potential services exposed by the NF Instance. This service operation is not allowed to be invoked from an NRF in a different PLMN.If the \"Shared-Data-Registration\" feature is supported, the registered profile may contain shared data Ids identifying shared data, and the operation also allows consumers to register shared data in the NRF. In deployments where shared data are locally configured at the NRF by means of OAM, support of shared data registration by means of the Nnrf_NFManagement service is not a required part of the \"Shared-Data-Registration\" feature.\n-\tNFUpdate: It allows an NF, SCP or SEPP Instance to replace, or update partially, the parameters of its profile (including the parameters of the associated services, if any) in the NRF; it also allows to add or delete individual services offered by the NF Instance. This service operation is not allowed to be invoked from an NRF in a different PLMN.If the \"Shared-Data-Registration\" feature is supported, it also allows consumers to update shared data in the NRF. In deployments where shared data are locally configured at the NRF by means of OAM, support of shared data update by means of the Nnrf_NFManagement service is not a required part of the \"Shared-Data-Registration\" feature.\n-\tNFDeregister: It allows an NF, SCP or SEPP Instance to deregister its profile in the NRF, including the services offered by the NF Instance, if any. This service operation is not allowed to be invoked from an NRF in a different PLMN.If the \"Shared-Data-Registration\" feature is supported, it also allows consumers to deregister shared data in the NRF. In deployments where shared data are locally configured at the NRF by means of OAM, support of shared data de-registration by means of the Nnrf_NFManagement service is not a required part of the \"Shared-Data-Registration\" feature.\n-\tNFStatusSubscribe: It allows an NF or SCP Instance to subscribe to changes on the status of NF or SEPP Instances registered in NRF. It also allows an SCP Instance to subscribe to changes on the status of other SCP Instances registered in NRF. This service operation can be invoked by an NF Instance in a different PLMN (via the local NRF in that PLMN) for changes on the status of NF Instances. It cannot be invoked by an SCP instance in a different PLMN. For changes on the status of SEPP Instance, this operation can only be invoked between the NRF and an NF Instance or SCP in the same PLMN.If the \"Shared-Data-Retrieval\" feature is supported, it also allows NF service consumers to create or update subscriptions to shared data change notifications in the NRF.\n-\tNFStatusNotify: It allows the NRF to notify subscribed NF or SCP Instances of changes on the status of NF or SEPP Instances. It also allows the NRF to notify subscribed SCP Instances of changes on the status of SCP Instances. This service operation can be invoked directly between the NRF and an NF Instance in a different PLMN (without involvement of the local NRF in that PLMN) for changes on the status of NF Instances. It cannot be invoked between the NRF and an SCP instance in a different PLMN. For changes on the status of SEPP Instance, this operation can only be invoked between the NRF and an NF Instance or SCP in the same PLMN.If the \"Shared-Data-Retrieval\" feature is supported, it also allows NF service consumers to be notified of the shared data changes in the NRF.\n-\tNFStatusUnsubscribe: It allows an NF or SCP Instance to unsubscribe to changes on the status of NF or SEPP Instances registered in NRF. It also allows an SCP Instance to unsubscribe to changes on the status of other SCP Instances registered in NRF. This service operation can be invoked by an NF Instance in a different PLMN (via the local NRF in that PLMN) for changes on the status of NF Instances. It cannot be invoked by an SCP instance in a different PLMN. For changes on the status of SEPP Instance, this operation can only be invoked between the NRF and an NF Instance or SCP in the same PLMN.If the \"Shared-Data-Retrieval\" feature is supported, it also allows NF service consumers to delete subscriptions to shared data change notifications in the NRF.\nNOTE 1:\tThe \"change of status\" of the NFStatus service operations can imply a request to be notified of newly registered NF, SCP or SEPP Instances in NRF, or to be notified of profile changes of a specific NF, SCP or SEPP Instance, or to be notified of the deregistration of an NF, SCP or SEPP Instance.\nNOTE 2:\tAn NRF instance can also use the NFRegister, NFUpdate or NFDeregister service operations or OA&M system to register, update or deregister its profile in another NRF in the same PLMN.\n-\tNFListRetrieval: It allows retrieving a list of NFs, SCPs and SEPPs currently registered in the NRF. This service operation is not allowed to be invoked from an NRF in a different PLMN.\n-\tNFProfileRetrieval: It allows retrieving the profile of a given NF, SCP or SEPP instance. This service operation is not allowed to be invoked from an NRF in a different PLMN.\n-\tSharedDataRetrieval: If the \"Shared-Data-Retrieval\" feature is supported, it allows NF service consumers to retrieve shared data from the NRF\nThe NFStatusSubscribe / NFstatusNotify / NFStatusUnsubscribe operations can be invoked by an NF Service Consumer (i.e., \"source NF\" or \"SCP\") requesting to be notified about events (registration, deregistration, profile change) related to an NF instance (i.e., \"target NF\") located in the same PLMN, or in a different PLMN, or related to a SEPP instance located in the same PLMN. An SCP can also invoke these operations to be notified about events (registration, deregistration, profile change) related to an SCP instance or SEPP instance located in the same PLMN.\nIn the description of these operations in clauses 5.2.2.5, 5.2.2.6 and 5.2.2.7, when the NF instances are located in the same PLMN, both source NF and target NF are said to be located in the \"Serving PLMN\" but, in the general case, the functionality is not restricted to the PLMN that is serving a given UE, and it shall be applicable as well to any scenario in which source NF and target NFs belong to the same PLMN.\nWhen source NF and target NF are located in different PLMNs, the source NF is said to be in the \"Serving PLMN\", and the target NF (and the NRF where such NF is registered) is said to be in the \"Home PLMN\", similarly to the scenarios described in 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], but the functionality shall be equally applicable to any scenario between any pair of PLMNs (e.g. with the source NF in the Home PLMN and the target NF in the Serving PLMN).\nThe SCP and SEPP are treated by the Nnrf_NFManagement service in the same way as NFs. Specifically, the SCP and SEPP are designated with a specific NF type and NF Instance ID. However, the SCP and SEPP do not support services. Accordingly, references to \"NF\" or \"NF Profile\" in the description of the service operations in the following clauses also apply to an SCP and SEPP.\nAn NRF may be part of an NRF set, whereby all NRF instances of the NRF Set share the same context data (e.g. registered NF profiles, NF status subscriptions). If so:\n-\tthe NF Service Consumer may be configured with the NRF Set ID or it may discover the same in the NRF Bootstrapping response.\n-\tThe NF Service Consumer may register with any of the NRF Instance of the NRF Set. If the NRF instance where an NF Service Consumer registered is down, the NF Service Consumer needs not re-register to any new NRF instance within the NRF Set.\n-\tThe NRF may provide a binding indication to the NF service consumer, e.g. when the NF Service Consumer registers or updates its NF profile in the NRF or when it issues heartbeat requests, to indicate a preferred binding of the NF Service Consumer to one NRF instance within the NRF set, e.g. based on the location or data center of the registering/registered NF Service Consumer.\nNOTE 3:\tThe NF Service Consumer can retrieve the NRF Set Information from the NRF via the Nnrf_NFDiscovery service as specified in clause 5.3.2.1.",

E.g., prefixing the custom NF type name with the string \"CUSTOM_\".\nDuring the registration of a Network Function instance with a custom NF type, the NF instance may provide NF-specific data (in the \"customInfo\" attribute), that shall be stored by the NRF as part of the NF profile of the NF instance.\nThe NRF shall accept the registration of NF Instances containing Vendor-Specific attributes (see 3GPP TS 29.500 [4], clause 6.6.3), and therefore, it shall accept NF Profiles containing attributes whose type may be unknown to the NRF, and those attributes shall be stored as part of the NF's profile data in NRF.\nBefore an NF Instance registers its NF Profile in NRF, the NF Instance should check the capabilities of the NRF by issuing an OPTIONS request to the \"nf-instances\" resource (see clause 6.1.3.2.3.2), unless the NF Instance already sent a Bootstrapping Request to the NRF and received the nrfFeatures attribute in the response. The NRF may indicate in the response capabilities such as the support of receiving compressed content in the HTTP PUT request used for registration of the NF Profile, or support of specific attributes of the NF Profile.\nNOTE 2:\tA Rel-16 NF needs to register the list of NF Service Instances in the \"nfServices\" array attribute towards an NRF not supporting the Service-Map feature (i.e. a Rel-15 NRF).",

When the NF Service Consumer creates multiple subscriptions in the NRF, it should use distinct callback URIs for each subscription.\nThe subscription request may also include additional parameters indicating the list of attributes (including Vendor-Specific attributes, see 3GPP TS 29.500 [4], clause 6.6.3) in the NF Profile to be monitored (or to be excluded from monitoring), in order to determine whether a notification from NRF should be sent, or not, when any of those attributes is changed in the profile.\nThe NF Service Consumer may request the creation of a subscription to a specific NF Instance, or to a set of NF Instances, where the set is determined according to different criteria specified in the request body, in the \"subscrCond\" attribute of the \"SubscriptionData\" object type (see clause 6.1.6.2.16).\nThe subscription shall be authorized, or rejected, by the NRF by checking the relevant input attributes (e.g. reqNfType, reqNfFqdn, reqSnssais, reqPerPlmnSnssais, reqPlmnList, reqSnpnList, etc.) in the subscription request body (along with the contents of any optional Oauth2 access token provided in the API request) against the list of authorization attributes in the NF Profile of the target NF Instance to be monitored.\nAn SCP may request a subscription to the complete profile of NF Instances (including, e.g. the authorization attributes of the target NF Instances to be monitored). Upon receiving such a request, the NRF shall verify that the requesting entity is authorized to subscribe to the complete profile of NF instances, based on local policies or the receipt of an Oauth2 access token granting such permission. If the requesting entity is not authorized to do so, the NRF shall reject the request or handle it as a subscription request without access to the complete profile.\nWhen the subscription request is for a set of NFs, the authorization attributes of the NF Instances in the set may differ, resulting in positive authorization of the subscription for only a part of the NF Instances in the set; in that case, the subscription to the set of NFs may be accepted by the NRF, but the NF Instances in the set that are not authorized for the NF Service Consumer that requested the subscription, shall not result in triggering any notification event from the NRF to the NF Service Consumer.\n2a.\tOn success, \"201 Created\" shall be returned. The response shall contain the data related to the created subscription, including the validity time, as determined by the NRF, after which the subscription becomes invalid. Once the subscription expires, if the NF Service Consumer wants to keep receiving status notifications, it shall create a new subscription in the NRF.\n2b.\tOn failure or redirection:\n-\tIf the creation of the subscription fails at the NRF due to errors in the SubscriptionData JSON object in the request body, the NRF shall return \"400 Bad Request\" status code with the ProblemDetails IE providing details of the error. E.g., the NRF may verify that the input attributes (e.g. reqNfType) in the subscription request match with the corresponding ones in, e.g. the public key certificate of the NF service consumer received during TLS initial handshake procedure (see 3GPP TS 33.310 [50]). If the verification is unsuccessful, the request shall be rejected with \"400 Bad Request\" status code and the \"cause\" attribute set to \"INVALID_CLIENT\".\n-\tIf the creation of the subscription fails at the NRF due to NRF internal errors, the NRF shall return \"500 Internal Server Error\" status code with the ProblemDetails IE providing details of the error.\n-\tIn the case of redirection, the NRF shall return 3xx status code, which shall contain a Location header with an URI pointing to the endpoint of another NRF service instance.",

In that case, the NRF indicates in the notification data whether the notification is due to the NF Instance to newly start or stop matching the subscription condition (i.e. based on the presence of the \"conditionEvent\" attribute of the NotificationData).\nThe notification of changes of the profile may be done by the NRF either by sending the entire new NF Profile, or by indicating a number of \"delta\" changes (see clause 6.1.6.2.17) from an existing NF Profile that might have been previously received by the NF Service Consumer during an NFDiscovery search operation (see clause 5.3.2.2).

      "content": "The service operations defined for the Nnrf_NFDiscovery service are as follows:\n-\tNFDiscover: It provides to the NF service consumer or SCP the profile (including IP address(es) or FQDN) of the NF Instance(s) or NF Service(s) or SEPP instances matching certain input criteria. It also provides to the SCP the profile (including IP address(es) or FQDN) of the SCP Instance(s) matching certain input criteria.\nThe NFDiscover operation can be invoked by an NF Service Consumer (i.e., \"source NF\") or SCP requesting to discover NF instances (i.e., \"target NFs\") located in the same PLMN, or in a different PLMN, or SEPP instances located in the same PLMN. It can also be invoked by an SCP requesting to discover SCP instances located in the same PLMN.\nIn the description of these operations in clause 5.3.2.2, when the NF instances are located in the same PLMN, both source NF and target NFs are said to be located in the \"Serving PLMN\" but, in the general case, the functionality is not restricted to the PLMN that is serving a given UE, and it shall be applicable as well to any scenario in which source NF and target NFs belong to the same PLMN.\nWhen source NF and target NFs are located in different PLMNs, the source NF is said to be in the \"Serving PLMN\", and the target NFs (and the NRF where they are registered) are said to be in the \"Home PLMN\", similarly to the scenarios described in 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], but the functionality shall be equally applicable to any scenario between any pair of PLMNs (e.g. with the source NF in the Home PLMN and the target NF in the Serving PLMN).\nThe SCP and SEPP are treated by the Nnrf_NFDiscovery service in the same way as NFs. Specifically, the SCP and SEPP are designated with a specific NF type and NF Instance ID. However, the SCP and SEPP do not support services. Accordingly, references to \"NF\" or \"NF Profile\" in the description of the service operations in the following clauses also apply to an SCP and SEPP.\n-\tSCPDomainRoutingInfoGet: It allows a service consumer (e.g. SCP) to fetch the SCP domain routing information (list of all SCP Domains registered by SCPs and the interconnected SCP domains per SCP domain), if both the SCP and the NRF supports the \"SCPDRI\" feature. It also allows a service consumer (e.g. NRF) to fetch the local SCP domain routing information (based on SCPs registered in the NRF as service producer), if both the NRF as service consumer and NRF as service producer supports the \"SCPDRI\" feature.\nNOTE:\tTwo SCP domains are considered interconnected when at least one SCP belongs to both SCP domains, i.e. at least one SCP can bridge messages between these two SCP domains.\n-\tSCPDomainRoutingInfoSubscribe: It allows a service consumer (e.g. SCP) to create a subscription for changes of the SCP domain routing information, if both the SCP and the NRF supports the \"SCPDRI\" feature. It also allows a service consumer (e.g. NRF) to create a subscription for changes of local SCP domain routing information, if both the NRF as service consumer and NRF as service producer supports the \"SCPDRI\" feature.\n-\tSCPDomainRoutingInfoNotify: It allows the NRF to send notification(s) to a service consumer (e.g. SCP) previously subscribed to the changes of the SCP domain routing information, if both the SCP and the NRF supports the \"SCPDRI\" feature. It also allows the NRF as service producer to send notification(s) to a service consumer (e.g. NRF) previously subscribed to the changes of the local SCP domain routing information, if both the NRF as service consumer and NRF as service producer supports the \"SCPDRI\" feature.\n-\tSCPDomainRoutingInfoUnsubscribe: It allows a service consumer (e.g. SCP or NRF) to delete a previously created subscription for changes of the SCP domain routing information, if both the service consumer and the NRF as service producer supports the \"SCPDRI\" feature.\nA NRF may be part of an NRF set, whereby all NRF instances of the NRF Set share the same context data (e.g. registered NF profiles, NF status subscriptions) , as specified in clause 5.2.2.1. If so:\n-\tthe NF Service Consumer may be configured with the NRF Set ID or it may discover the same in the NRF Bootstrapping response;\n-\tthe NF Service Consumer may discover the NRF Set Information from the NRF via the Nnrf_NFDiscovery service by issuing an NF Discovery Request including the target-nf-type parameter set to \"NRF\" and the target-nf-set-id parameter set to the NRF Set ID, which allows to discover the list of NRF instances that are part of the NRF set with, for each NRF instance, its NRF Instance ID and addressing information (i.e. part of NRF profile).\nNOTE:\tAs part of the discovery of NRF instances belonging to an NRF Set, not all attributes in the NFProfile and NFService data structures (typically used for NF Consumer – NF Producer interaction) are needed for the NF Consumer to interact with the instances of the NRF Set, so the discovery response from NRF can be simplified and omit certain parameters.",

In such case, when the results of a previous query are reused, the service consumer need consider that the previous results will possibly include NF profiles that the new query would not; hence, the service consumer has to complete the filtering itself against the additional filter attributes in the new internal query.\nOtherwise, if the query parameters in the new service discovery are different and don't consist of the previous query attributes and additional ones (i.e. the new query parameters, in general, don't have any relationship with those of the previous search), the reuse of cached profiles may still be done.\nIn these two last cases (i.e. where the query parameters of the new query are not identical to the previous query), re-using data from cached profiles may possibly yield to different results than if a new discovery was performed, and thus may be subject to operator's policy.\nNOTE:\tCertain types of query attributes affect the contents of the NF Profiles returned in the discovery responses (e.g., \"preferred-location\" typically affects the setting of the \"priority\" attribute inside the NF Profiles returned by NRF); reusing the results from a previous query, when the new query involves any of such parameters, may not be feasible.\nIf an SCP receives complete NF profiles (including, e.g. the authorization attributes) from the NRF (see clauses 5.3.2.2.2 and 5.2.2.5.2), the SCP may use these cached profiles to serve new service requests received from NFs with different requester's information (e.g. different NF type, domain, S-NSSAI), but if it does so, the SCP shall check the authorization parameters of the complete profiles to ascertain that the requesting NFs are authorized to access the related NF services.\nThe NF Service Consumer should avoid to send multiple NF discovery requests with the same query parameters to NRF simultaneously.",

The format of the sharedProfileDataId shall be a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) version 4, as described in IETF RFC 4122 [18]. The hexadecimal letters should be formatted as lower-case characters by the sender, and they shall be handled as case-insensitive by the receiver.\nExample:\n\"4ace9d34-2c69-4f99-92d5-a73a3fe8e23b\"\nShared-Data-Registration, Shared-Data-Retrieval\nNOTE 1:\tAt least one of the addressing parameters (fqdn, ipv4address or ipv6adress) shall be included in the NF Profile. If the NF supports the NF services with \"https\" URI scheme (i.e use of TLS is mandatory), then the FQDN shall be provided in the NF Profile or the NF Service profile (see clause 6.1.6.2.3) and it shall be used to construct the target URI (unless overriden by a NFService-specific FQDN). See NOTE 1 of Table 6.1.6.2.3-1 for the use of these parameters. If multiple ipv4 addresses and/or ipv6 addresses are included in the NF Profile, the NF Service Consumer of the discovery service shall select one of these addresses randomly, unless operator defined local policy of IP address selection, in order to avoid overload for a specific ipv4 address and/or ipv6 address.\nNOTE 2:\tIf the type of Network Function is UPF, the addressing information is for the UPF N4 interface and, if the UPF registers service instances supporting the UPF Event Exposure service or the Nupf_GetUEPrivateIPaddrAndIdentifiers service without registering addressing information at these service instances level, also for accessing the UPF Event Exposure service or the Nupf_GetUEPrivateIPaddrAndIdentifiers service at these service instances. If the type of Network Function is MB-UPF, the addressing information is for the MB-UPF N4mb interface. If the type of Network Function is a P-CSCF and if no Gm FQDN or IP addresses are registered in the pcscfInfoList attribute, the addressing information is also used for the P-CSCF Gm interface.\nNOTE 3:\tA requester NF may use this information to select a NF instance (e.g. a NF instance preferably located in the same data center).\nNOTE 4:\tThe capacity and priority parameters, if present, are used for NF selection and load balancing. The priority and capacity attributes shall be used for NF selection in the same way that priority and weight are used for server selection as defined in IETF RFC 2782 [23].\nNOTE 5:\tThe NRF shall notify NFs subscribed to receiving notifications of changes of the NF profile, if the NF recoveryTime or the nfStatus is changed. See clause 6.2 of 3GPP TS 23.527 [27].\nNOTE 6:\tA requester NF may consider that all the resources created in the NF before the NF recovery time have been lost. This may be used to detect a restart of a NF and to trigger appropriate actions, e.g. release local resources. See clause 6.2 of 3GPP TS 23.527 [27].\nNOTE 7:\tA NF may register multiple PLMN IDs in its profile within a PLMN comprising multiple PLMN IDs. If so, all the attributes of the NF Profile shall apply to each PLMN ID registered in the plmnList. As an exception, attributes including a PLMN ID, e.g. IMSI-based SUPI ranges, TAIs and GUAMIs, are specific to one PLMN ID and the NF may register in its profile multiple occurrences of such attributes for different PLMN IDs (e.g. the UDM may register in its profile SUPI ranges for different PLMN IDs).\nNOTE 8:\tOther NFs are in a different PLMN if they belong to none of the PLMN ID(s) configured for the PLMN of the NRF.\nNOTE 9:\tThis is for the use case where an NF (e.g. AMF) supports multiple PLMNs and the slices supported in each PLMN are different. See clause 9.2.6.2 of 3GPP TS 38.413 [29].\nNOTE 10:\tFor notification types that may be associated with a specifc service of the NF Instance receiving the notification (see clause 6.1.6.3.4), if notification endpoints are present both in the profile of the NF instance (NFProfile) and in some of its NF Services (NFService) for a same notification type, the notification endpoint(s) of the NF Services shall be used for this notification type. The defaultNotificationSubscriptions attribute may contain multiple default subscriptions for a same notification type; in that case, those default subscriptions are used as alternative notification endpoints so, for each notification event that needs to be sent, the NF Service Consumer shall select one of such subscriptions and use it to send the notification.\nNOTE 11:\tThe absence of the pcscfInfoList attribute in a P-CSCF profile indicates that the P-CSCF can be selected for any DNN and Access Type, and that the P-CSCF Gm addressing information is the same as the addressing information registered in the fqdn, ipv4Addresses and ipv4Addresses attributes of the NF profile.\nNOTE 12:\tThe absence of both the smfInfo and smfInfoList attributes in an SMF profile indicates that the SMF can be selected for any S-NSSAI listed in the sNssais and perPlmnSnssaiList IEs, or for any S-NSSAI if neither the sNssais IE nor the perPlmnSnssaiList IE are present, and for any DNN, TAI and access type.\nNOTE 13:\tThe servingScope attribute may indicate geographical areas, It may be used e.g. to discover and select NFs in centralized Data Centers that are expected to serve users located in specific region(s) or province(s). It may also be used to reduce the large configuration of TAIs in the NF instances.\nNOTE 14:\tAn NF (other than a SCP) can register at most one SCP domain in NF profile, i.e. the NF can belong to only one SCP domain. If an NF (other than a SCP) includes this information in its profile, this indicates that the services produced by this NF should be accessed preferably via an SCP from the SCP domain the NF belongs to.\nNOTE 15:\tIf the NF Service Consumer that issues an NF profile retrieval request indicates support for the \"Service-Map\" feature, the NRF shall return in the NF profile retrieval response the list of NF Service Instances in the \"nfServiceList\" map attribute. Otherwise, the NRF shall return the list of NF Service Instances in the \"nfServices\" array attribute.\nNOTE 16:\tThe nfStatus also indicate the Status of the NF instance as NF Service Consumer for notification delivery. When a notification is to be delivered to the NF instance and the NF Service Producer (or SCP) has been aware that the NF instance is not operative from the nfStatus in its NF profile, the NF Service producer (or SCP) shall reselect another NF Service Consumer as target if possible, e.g. using binding indication or discovery factors previously provided for the notification. When selecting or reselecting an NF Service Consumer for notification delivery, not operative NF instances shall not be selected as target.\nNOTE 17:\tA change of this attribute shall trigger a \"NF_PROFILE_CHANGED\" notification from NRF, if the change of the NF Profile results in that the NF Instance starts or stops being authorized to be accessed by an NF having subscribed to be notified about NF profile changes.\nNOTE 18:\tFor API URIs constructed with an FQDN, the NF Service Consumer may use the FQDN of the target URI to do a DNS query and obtain the IP address(es) to setup the TCP connection, and ignore the IP addresses that may be present in the NFProfile; alternatively, the NF Service Consumer may use those IP addresses to setup the TCP connection, if no service-specific FQDN or IP address is provided in the NFService data and if the NF Service Consumer supports to indicate specific IP address(es) to establish an HTTP/2 connection with an FQDN in the target URI.\nNOTE 19:\tWhen present, this attribute allows an NF requesting NF Discovery (e.g. an NF Service Consumer) to determine which vendor-specific extensions are supported in a given NF (e.g. an NF Service Producer), so as to select an appropriate NF with specific capability, or to include or not the vendor-specific attributes (see 3GPP TS 29.500 [4] clause 6.6.3) required for a given feature in subsequent messages towards a certain NF. One given vendor-specific feature shall not appear in both NF Profile and NF Service Profile. If one vendor-specific feature is service related, it shall only be included in the NF Service Profile.\nNOTE 20:\tThe absence of the easdfInfoList attribute in an EASDF profile indicates that the EASDF can be selected for any S-NSSAI, DNN, DNAI or PSA UPF N6 IP address.\nNOTE 21:\tThe NF service consumer when invoking NF services offered by collocated NF service producers shall follow the respective service API in the same manner as if they were not collocated with any other NF type. The NF service consumer shall not assume any optimization of signaling between the NF service consumer and the collocated NF service producers.\nNOTE 22:\tThe nfSetIdList attribute shall be present only if all NF service instance(s) of the NF instance are redundant at NF Set level. I.e. any NF service instance shall be redundant (i.e. functionally equivalent, inter-changeable and sharing contexts) with equivalent service instance(s) of every other NF instance(s) within the indicated NF Set or, if the NF service instance belongs to an NF service set, it shall be redundant with NF service instance(s) in an equivalent NF service set of every other NF instance(s) within the indicated NF set.\nNOTE 23:\tThe NF Instance shall be removed from an NF set or re-assigned to another NF set ONLY when there is NO ongoing resource/context associated with the NF instance.",

The priority and capacity attributes shall be used for NF selection in the same way that priority and weight are used for server selection as defined in IETF RFC 2782 [23].\nNOTE 3:\tThe NRF shall notify NFs subscribed to receiving notifications of changes of the NF profile, if the recoveryTime or the nfServiceStatus is changed. See clause 6.2 of 3GPP TS 23.527 [27].\nNOTE 4:\tA requester NF subscribed to NF status changes may consider that all the resources created in the NF service before the NF service recovery time have been lost. This may be used to detect a restart of a NF service and to trigger appropriate actions, e.g. release local resources. See clause 6.2 of 3GPP TS 23.527 [27].\nNOTE 5:\tIf this attribute is present in the NFService and in the NF profile, the attribute from the NFService shall prevail. The absence of this attribute in the NFService and in the NFProfile indicates that there is no corresponding restriction to access the service instance.

See clause 9.2.6.2 of 3GPP TS 38.413 [29].\nNOTE 10:\tWhen present, this attribute allows the NF requesting NF discovery (e.g. an NF Service Consumer) to determine which vendor-specific extensions are supported in a given NF (e.g. an Service Producer) in order to select an appropriate NF, or to include or not include the vendor-specific attributes (see 3GPP TS 29.500 [4] clause 6.6.3) required for a given feature in subsequent service requests towards a certain service instance of the NF Service Producer. One given vendor-specific feature shall not appear in both NF Profile and NF Service Profile. If one vendor-specific feature is service related, it shall only be included in the NF Service Profile.\nNOTE 11:\tThese attributes are used in order to determine whether a given resource/operation-level scope shall be granted to an NF Service Consumer that requested an Oauth2 access token with a specific scope. If attribute \"allowedOperationsPerNfInstanceOverrides\" is absent, or set to false, the NRF shall only grant such scope in the access token, if the scope is present in either \"allowedOperationsPerNfType\", for the specific NF type of the NF Service Consumer, or in \"allowedOperationsPerNfInstance\", for the specific NF instance ID of the NF Service Consumer. If attribute \"allowedOperationsPerNfInstanceOverrides\" is present and set to true, the NRF shall grant such scope in the access token, if the scope is included in the \"allowedOperationsPerNfInstance\" attribute for the NF Instance ID of the NF Service Consumer. If attribute \"allowedOperationPerNfInstanceOverrides\" is present and set to true, but the NF Instance ID of the NF Service Consumer is not included in attribute \"allowedOperationPerNfInstance\", the NRF shall grant such scope if it is present in the \"allowedOperationsPerNfType\" for the specific NF type of the NF Service Consumer.These attributes need not be registered if the NF service instance only supports (or is configured to only use) the service-level scope for all NF service consumers allowed to access the service. When both these attributes are absent, the NRF should grant access tokens for the service-level scope only.When at least one of these IEs is present, these IEs shall indicate all the NF types or NF instances allowed to access the NF service instance, with all the corresponding scopes (i.e. the service-level scope and resource/operation specific scopes) allowed for each NF type or NF instance, i.e. any NF type or NF instance not listed in these IEs is disallowed to access the NF service instance.\nExample: if an NF service instance is configured to enable an NF type X to access all service operations including resource/operations defined with resource/operation specific scopes and an NF type Y toaccess only the service operations not requiring resource/operation specific scopes, the allowedOperationsPerNfType IE should be present and set as follows:allowedOperationsPerNfType: {  X: [<service-level scope>, <resource/operation scope 1>, <resource/operation scope 2>],  Y: [<service-level scope>]}\nNOTE 12:\tThe nfServiceStatus also indicate the Status of the NF service instance as NF Service Consumer for notification delivery. When a notification is to be delivered to the NF service instance and the NF Service Producer (or SCP) has been aware that the NF service instance is not operative from the nfServiceStatus in the NF profile, the NF Service producer (or SCP) shall reselect another NF Service Consumer as target if possible, e.g. using binding indication or discovery factors previously provided for the notification. When selecting or reselecting an NF Service Consumer for notification delivery, not operative NF (service) instances shall not be selected as target.\nNOTE 13:\tA change of this attribute shall trigger a \"NF_PROFILE_CHANGED\" notification from NRF, if the change of the NF Profile results in that the NF Instance starts or stops being authorized to be accessed by an NF having subscribed to be notified about NF profile changes.\nNOTE 14:\tFor API URIs constructed with an FQDN, the NF Service Consumer may use the FQDN in the target URI to do a DNS query and obtain the IP address(es) to setup the TCP connection, and ignore the IP addresses that may be present in the ipEndPoints attribute; alternatively, the NF Service Consumer may use those IP addresses to setup the TCP connection, if the NF Service Consumer supports to indicate specific IP address(es) to establish an HTTP/2 connection with an FQDN in the target URI.\nNOTE 15:\tThe NF service Instance shall be removed from an NF service set or re-assigned to another NF service set ONLY when there is NO ongoing resource/context associated with the NF service instance.",

This is so because the authority of the target URI shall consist of an FQDN (due to the \"https\" scheme or inter-PLMN signalling), and it is not always possible to ensure which IP address will be used by the HTTP/2 stack after the DNS resolution has been performed.\nNOTE 6:\tIf the \"ipEndPoints\" array contains an entry (IpEndPoint object) containing either ipv4Address or ipv6Address, and with the \"port\" attribute absent, the NF Service Consumer shall use the default port for the given HTTP scheme when building a target URI that uses such IP address in the authority field of the URI.\nThe following examples describe valid cases of the authority of target URIs, considering the addressing information present in the NFProfile and in the NFService objets (in the \"nfServiceList\" map).\nEXAMPLE 1:\nNFProfile:\n{\n\"fqdn\": \"nf.example.com\",\n\"ipv4Addresses\": [ \"1.2.3.4\" ],\n\"nfServiceList\": {\n\"Service1\": {\n\"scheme\": \"http\",\n\"ipEndPoints\": [\n{ \"port\": 8080 },\n{ \"ipv4Address\": \"1.2.3.5\", \"port\": 8081 }\n]\n}\n}\n}\nValid authority for target URIs:\nhttp://1.2.3.5:8081/\nNote that the IP address contained in ipEndPoints override the FQDN and IP address in NFProfile-level, so the value contained in \"port\" cannot be used, in this configuration.\nEXAMPLE 2:\nNFProfile:\n{\n\"fqdn\": \"nf.example.com\",\n\"ipv4Addresses\": [ \"1.2.3.4\" ],\n\"nfServiceList\": {\n\"Service1\": {\n\"scheme\": \"http\",\n\"fqdn\": \"service1.example.com\",\n\"ipEndPoints\": [\n{ \"ipv4Address\": \"1.2.3.5\", \"port\": 8081 },\n{ \"ipv4Address\": \"1.2.3.6\" }\n]\n}\n}\n}\nValid authority for target URIs:\nhttp://1.2.3.5:8081/\nhttp://1.2.3.6:80/\nhttp://1.2.3.6/\nEXAMPLE 3:\nNFProfile:\n{\n\"fqdn\": \"nf.example.com\",\n\"ipv4Addresses\": [ \"1.2.3.4\" ],\n\"nfServiceList\": {\n\"Service1\": {\n\"scheme\": \"http\",\n\"ipEndPoints\": [\n{ \"port\": 8080 },\n]\n}\n}\n}\nValid authority for target URIs:\nhttp://nf.example.com:8080/\nhttp://1.2.3.4:8080/",

When performing discovery, the AMF shall use other query parameters together with this IE to ensure the required configurations and/or features are supported by the V-SMF/I-SMF(s), e.g. required Slice for the PDU session, support of DTSSA feature if V-SMF change is required for PDU Session, etc. If no SMF instances that explicitly indicated support of V-SMF/I-SMF(s) capability can be matched for the discovery, the NRF shall return matched SMF instances not indicating support of V-SMF/I-SMF(s) capability explicitly, i.e. the SMF instances not registered vsmfSupportInd/ismfSupportInd IE in the NF profile but matched to the rest query parameters, if available.\nNOTE 16:\tWhen required-pfcp-features is used as query parameter, the NRF shall return a list of candidate UPFs supporting all the required PFCP features. The NRF may also return UPF profiles not including the \"SupportedPfcpFeatures\" attribute (e.g. pre-Rel-17 UPFs) but matching the other query parameters. The NF Service Consumer, e.g. a SMF, when using required-pfcp-features as query parameter, shall also include the query parameter corresponding to the UPF features (atsss-capability, upf-ue-ip-addr-ind, redundant-gtpu) which correspond to the PFCP feature flags MPTCP and ATSSS_LL, UEIP, and RTTL respectively, if the corresponding PFCP feature is required. For example an SMF, that wishes to select a UPF supporting UE IP Address Allocation by the UP function, shall set the UEIP flag to \"1\" in the required-pfcp-features and also include the upf-ue-ip-addr-ind parameter set to \"true\".\nNOTE 17:\tIn this release, the usage of Home Network Public Key identifier for AUSF/UDM discovery is limited to the scenario where the AUSF/UDM NF consumers belong to the same PLMN as AUSF/UDM.\nNOTE 18:\tThe NF service consumer may derive the serving scope from e.g. the TAI of the UE, using local configuration. This parameter may be used to discover any NF that registers to the NRF, e.g. a 5GC NF or a P-CSCF.\nNOTE 19:\tIf the NRF supports the \"Collocated-NF-Selection\" feature and the NF service consumer has included the \"preferred-collocated-nf-types\" attribute, the NRF shall return a list of candidates NFs (for the target-nf-type) matching the discovery query parameters and preferentially supporting CollocatedNfType(s) as indicated in the preferred-collocated-nf-types.\nNOTE 20:\tIf the NRF supports this IE and the NF service consumer has included this IE with the value \"true\" in discovery request, the NRF shall look up and return PGW-C+SMF instances matching the other query parameters. If no matching is found, the NRF shall return a list of standalone SMF instances matching the other query parameters. If the NRF supports this IE and the NF service consumer has included this IE with the value \"false\" in discovery request, the NRF shall look up and return standalone SMF instances matching the other query parameters. If no matching is found, the NRF shall return a list of PGW-C+SMF instances matching the other query parameters.\nNOTE 21:\tEither pgw-ind IE or preferred-pgw-ind IE may be included in the discovery request.\nNOTE 22:\tMB-SMF may use an NRF to discover the AMF(s) serving an MBS service area (see clause 7.3.1 in 3GPP TS 23.247 [43]. For this purpose, the MB-SMF may use query parameters specified in this table, e.g.  'tai' and 'service-names', or 'snssais', or any other parameters.\nNOTE 23:\tThis parameter may be set by an NF service consumer or SCP to filter-out specific NF (service) instances or NF (service) sets from the NF Discovery response, e.g. when the NFc knows that an NF service producer is not responsive or overloaded. See the 3gpp-Sbi-Selection-Info header in clause 5.2.3.3.10 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].\nNOTE 24:\tA feature shall not be included in both required-features IE and preferred-features IE in the same discovery request.\nNOTE 25:\tWhen Locality is configured in NSACF(s), an NSACF consumer, e.g. AMF or SMF, may use a locally configured NSACF Locality to discover the candidate NSACF, or otherwise may use its own Locality to discover the candidate NSACF. When Locality is configured in MRF(s) or MRFP(s), an MRF/MRFP consumer, e.g. IMS entity, may use a locally configured MRF/MRFP Locality to discover the candidate MRF/MRFP, or otherwise may use its own Locality to discover the candidate MRF/MRFP. When Locality is configured in MF, an MF consumer, e.g. IMS AS, may use a locally configured MF Locality to discover the candidate MF, or otherwise may use its own Locality to discover the candidate MF.\nNOTE 26:\tOnly one of the target-nf-instance-id and target-nf-instance-id-list query parameters may be present in an NF Discovery Request.\nNOTE 27:\tWhen the query parameter \"ue-ipv4-address\" or \"ue-ipv6-prefix\" is used to discover a UPF as specified in clause 4.15.10 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], the NRF shall find a match by looking into either natedIpv4AddressRanges or natedIpv6PrefixRanges in the DnnUpfInfoItem.\nNOTE 28:\tIf the NF service consumer includes a \"tai-list\" query parameter and the \"nf-tai-list-ind\" query parameter set to true, and if the NRF supports the same and the NRF is not able to find any NF supporting all TAs included in the tai-list, the NRF may return a list of NFs in the SearchResult where each NF supports at least one TA in the tai-list; in this case, the NRF should attempt to return a list of NFs that altogether support as many TAIs from the tai-list as possible, and it should indicate in the SearchResultInfo attribute the list of TAIs from the tai-list which are not supported by these NFs.\nNOTE 29:\tThe NRF should return as many matching NF profiles and/or NF Instance IDs as possible in the NF Discovery Response. If all the NF profiles matching the query parameters cannot be returned in the NF Discovery response (e.g. due to the maximum payload size), the NRF may decide to store the complete search result for subsequent retrieval by the NRF consumer (see clause 6.2.3.4). Alternatively, the NRF may include all the NF instance IDs rather than NF profiles in the NF Discovery response (using the Enh-NF-Discovery feature, see clause 5.3.2.2.2).\nWhen certain query parameters in the discovery request are not supported by the NRF, the NRF shall ignore the unsupported query parameters and continue processing the request with the supported query parameters. The default logical relationship among the supported query parameters is logical \"AND\", i.e. all the provided query parameters shall be matched, with the exception of the \"preferred-locality\", \"ext-preferred-locality\", \"preferred-nf-instances\", \"preferred-tai\", \"preferred-api-versions\", \"preferred-full-plmn\", \"preferred-collocated-nf-types\", \"preferred-pgw-ind\", \"preferred-analytics-delays\", \"preferred-features\" and \"mbs-session-id\" query parameters (see Table 6.2.3.2.3.1-1).\nThe NRF may support the Complex query expression as defined in 3GPP TS 29.501 [5] for the NF Discovery service. If the \"complexQuery\" query parameter is included, then the logical relationship among the query parameters contained in \"complexQuery\" query parameter is as defined in 3GPP TS 29.571 [7].\nA NRF not supporting Complex query expression shall reject a NF service discovery request including a complexQuery parameter, with a ProblemDetails IE including the cause attribute set to INVALID_QUERY_PARAM and the invalidParams attribute indicating the complexQuery parameter.\nThis method shall support the request data structures specified in table 6.1.3.2.3.1-2 and the response data structures and response codes specified in table 6.1.3.2.3.1-3.\nTable 6.2.3.2.3.1-2: Data structures supported by the GET Request Body on this resource\nData type\nP\nCardinality\nDescription\nn/a\nTable 6.2.3.2.3.1-3: Data structures supported by the GET Response Body on this resource\nData type\nP\nCardinality\nResponse\ncodes\nDescription\nSearchResult\nM\n1\n200 OK\nThe response body contains the result of the search over the list of registered NF Instances.\nRedirectResponse\nO\n0..1\n307 Temporary Redirect\nThe response shall be used when the intermediate NRF redirects the service discovery request.\nThe NRF shall include in this response a Location header field containing a URI pointing to the resource located on the redirect target NRF.\nIf an SCP redirects the message to another SCP then the location header field shall contain the same URI or a different URI pointing to the endpoint of the NF service producer to which the request should be sent.\nProblemDetails\nO\n0..1\n400 Bad Request\nThe response body contains the error reason of the request message.\nIf the query parameter used to match the authorization parameter is required but not provided in the NF discovery request, the \"cause\" attribute shall be set to \"MANDATORY_QUERY_PARAM_MISSING\", and the missing query parameter shall be indicated.\nThe \"cause\" attribute shall be set to \"INVALID_CLIENT\" if some or all attributes of the NF Service Consumer in query parameters do not match the requester information in, e.g. its public key certificate.\nProblemDetails\nO\n0..1\n403 Forbidden\nThis response shall be returned if the Requester NF is not allowed to discover the NF Service(s) being queried.\nProblemDetails\nO\n0..1\n404 Not Found\nThis response shall be returned if the requested resource URI as defined in clause 6.2.3.2.2 (query parameter not considered) is not found in the server.\nIt may also be sent in hierarchical NRF deployments when the NRF needs to forward/redirect the request to another NRF but lacks information in the request to do so; similarly, the NRF shall return this response code when it is received from the upstream NRF.\nProblemDetails\nO\n0..1\n500 Internal Server Error\nThe response body contains the error reason of the request message.\nTable 6.2.3.2.3.1-4: Headers supported by the GET method on this endpoint\nName\nData type\nP\nCardinality\nDescription\nIf-None-Match\nstring\nC\n0..1\nValidator for conditional requests, as described in IETF RFC 9110 [40], clause 13.1.2\nTable 6.2.3.2.3.1-5: Headers supported by the 200 Response Code on this endpoint\nName\nData type\nP\nCardinality\nDescription\nCache-Control\nstring\nC\n0..1\nCache-Control containing max-age, described in IETF RFC 9111 [20], clause 5.2\nETag\nstring\nC\n0..1\nEntity Tag containing a strong validator, described in IETF RFC 9110 [40], clause 8.8.3\nTable 6.2.3.2.3.1-6: Headers supported by the 307 Response Code on this endpoint\nName\nData type\nP\nCardinality\nDescription\nLocation\nstring\nM\n1\nThe URI pointing to the resource located on the redirect target NRF\nTable 6.2.3.2.3.1-7: Links supported by the 200 Response Code on this endpoint\nName\nResource name\nHTTP method or custom operation\nParameters table\nDescription\nsearch\nStored Search (Document)\nGET\n6.2.3.2.3.1-8\nThe 'searchId' parameter returned in the response can be used as the 'searchId' parameter in the GET request to '/searches/{searchId}'\ncompleteSearch\nComplete Stored Search (Document)\nGET\n6.2.3.2.3.1-9\nThe 'searchId' parameter returned in the response can be used as the 'searchId' parameter in the GET request to '/searches/{searchId}/complete'",

The priority and capacity attributes shall be used for NF selection in the same way that priority and weight are used for server selection as defined in IETF RFC 2782 [23].\nNOTE 3:\tIf the requester-plmn in the query parameter is different from the PLMN of the discovered NF, then the fqdn attribute value shall contain the interPlmnFqdn value registered by the NF during NF registration (see clause 6.1.6.2.2). The requester-plmn is different from the PLMN of the discovered NF if it belongs to none of the PLMN ID(s) configured for the PLMN of the NRF.\nNOTE 4:\tThe usage of the load parameter by the NF service consumer is implementation specific, e.g. be used for NF selection and load balancing, together with other parameters.\nNOTE 5:\tAn NF may register multiple PLMN IDs in its profile within a PLMN comprising multiple PLMN IDs. If so, all the attributes of the NF Profile shall apply to each PLMN ID registered in the plmnList. As an exception, attributes including a PLMN ID, e.g. IMSI-based SUPI ranges, TAIs and GUAMIs, are specific to one PLMN ID and the NF may register in its profile multiple occurrences of such attributes for different PLMN IDs (e.g. the UDM may register in its profile SUPI ranges for different PLMN IDs).\nNOTE 6:\tFor notification types that may be associated with a specifc service of the NF Instance receiving the notification (see clause 6.1.6.3.4), if notification endpoints are present both in the profile of the NF instance (NFProfile) and in some of its NF Services (NFService) for a same notification type, the notification endpoint(s) of the NF Services shall be used for this notification type.\nNOTE 7:\tThe absence of the pcscfInfoList attribute in a P-CSCF profile indicates that the P-CSCF can be selected for any DNN and Access Type, and that the P-CSCF Gm addressing information is the same as the addressing information registered in the fqdn, ipv4Addresses and ipv4Addresses attributes of the NF profile.\nNOTE 8:\tThe absence of both the smfInfo and smfInfoList attributes in an SMF profile indicates that the SMF can be selected for any S-NSSAI listed in the sNssais and perPlmnSnssaiList IEs, or for any S-NSSAI if neither the sNssais IE nor the perPlmnSnssaiList IE are present, and for any DNN, TAI and access type.\nNOTE 9:\tIf an NF (other than a SCP or SEPP) includes this information in its profile, this indicates that the services produced by this NF should be accessed preferably via an SCP from the SCP domain the NF belongs to.\nNOTE 10:\tIf the NF Service Consumer that issued the discovery request indicated support for the \"Service-Map\" feature, the NRF shall return in the discovery response the list of NF Service Instances in the \"nfServiceList\" map attribute. Otherwise, the NRF shall return the list of NF Service Instances in the \"nfServices\" array attribute.\nNOTE 11:\tFor API URIs constructed with an FQDN, the NF Service Consumer may use the FQDN of the target URI to do a DNS query and obtain the IP address(es) to setup the TCP connection, and ignore the IP addresses that may be present in the NFProfile; alternatively, the NF Service Consumer may use those IP addresses to setup the TCP connection, if no service-specific FQDN or IP address is provided in the NFService data and if the NF Service Consumer supports to indicate specific IP address(es) to establish an HTTP/2 connection with an FQDN in the target URI.\nNOTE 12:\tWhen present, this attribute allows an NF requesting NF Discovery (e.g. an NF Service Consumer) to determine which vendor-specific extensions are supported in a given NF (e.g. an NF Service Producer), so as to select an appropriate NF with specific capability, or to include or not the vendor-specific attributes (see 3GPP TS 29.500 [4] clause 6.6.3) required for a given feature in subsequent messages towards a certain NF. One given vendor-specific feature shall not appear in both NF Profile and NF Service Profile. If one vendor-specific feature is service related, it shall only be included in the NF Service Profile.\nNOTE 13:\tThe absence of the easdfnfoList attributes in an EASDF profile indicates that the EASDF can be selected for any S-NSSAI, DNN, DNAI or PSA UPF N6 IP address.\nNOTE 14:\tThis attribute may be used by the requester NF or SCP e.g. to build the authority of the Location header in 3xx response or to set the 3gpp-Sbi-apiRoot header in a response message (see clause 6.10.4 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4]), when the NF redirects a request issued by a consumer from a different PLMN towards the discovered NF, or when the SCP has reselected the discovered NF for such a request.",

It shall be treated as a key, value pair data structure to be encoded using x-www-form-urlencoded format as specified in clause 17.13.4 of W3C HTML 4.01 Specification [26].\nNOTE 2:\tThough scope attribute is optional as per IETF RFC 6749 [16], it is mandatory for 3GPP as per 3GPP TS 33.501 [15].\nNOTE 3:\tAn access token request should be rejected if the requester NF is not allowed to access the target NF based on the authorization parameters in the NF profile of the target NF. The authorization parameters in NF Profile are those used by NRF to determine whether a given NF Instance / NF Service Instance can be discovered by an NF Service Consumer in order to consume its offered services (e.g. \"allowedNfTypes\", \"allowedNfDomains\", etc.).

Spaces are percent-encoded as '+'.\nThe request body, before URL-encoding, and displayed in multiples lines only for illustration purposes, would be:\ngrant_type=client_credentials\n&nfInstanceId=4e0b2760-0356-42c4-b739-8d6aaa491b63\n&nfType=AMF\n&targetNfType=UDM\n&scope=nudm-sdm nudm-uecm nudm-ueau\n&requesterPlmn={\"mcc\":\"123\",\"mnc\":\"456\"}\n&targetPlmn={\"mcc\":\"321\",\"mnc\":\"654\"}\n&targetSnssaiList=[{\"sst\":1,\"sd\":\"A08923\"},{\"sst\":2}]\n&targetNsiList=Slice A, instance 1\n&targetNsiList=Slice B, instance 2\nThe actual request message, after URL-encoding, and where all input parameters are contained into one single line in the request body, would be:\nPOST /oauth2/token\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nAccept: application/json\ngrant_type=client_credentials&nfInstanceId=4e0b2760‑0356‑42c4‑b739‑8d6aaa491b63&nfType=AMF&targetNfType=UDM&scope=nudm‑sdm+nudm‑uecm+nudm‑ueau&requesterPlmn=%7B%22mcc%22%3A%22123%22%2C%22mnc%22%3A%22456%22%7D&targetPlmn=%7B%22mcc%22%3A%22321%22%2C%22mnc%22%3A%22654%22%7D&targetSnssaiList=%5B%7B%22sst%22%3A1%2C%22sd%22%3A%22A08923%22%7D%2C%7B%22sst%22%3A2%7D%5D&targetNsiList=Slice+A%2C+instance+1&targetNsiList=Slice+B%2C+instance+2",

When doing so, the NRF shall include in the NF Profile returned in the response:\n-\tattributes that are mandatory to include in the NF Profile; if an optional IE is included (e.g. nfServices), attributes that are mandatory to include in this optional IE (e.g. serviceInstanceId) shall also be included;\n-\toptional or conditional IEs that have been changed or added by the NRF; and\n-\tthe nfProfileChangesInd IE set to \"true\", indicating that the returned profile contains NF profile changes.\nEXAMPLE 1:\tThe NRF does not change the NF Profile received in the request.\nThe NRF response contains a NFProfile with just the following IEs:\n-\tnfInstanceId, nfType, nfStatus; and\n-\tnfProfileChangesInd IE set to \"true\".\nEXAMPLE 2:\tThe NRF modifies or adds the heartbeatTimer attribute to the NF Profile received in the request.\nThe NRF response contains a NFProfile with just the following IEs:\n-\tnfInstanceId, nfType, nfStatus;\n-\theartbeatTimer with NRF chosen value;\n-\tnfProfileChangesInd IE set to \"true\".\nAnnex C (normative):Enhanced Authorization Policy using RuleSets in NF (Service) Profile\nC.1\tGeneral\nWhen scope of authorizations allowed to NF-Service-Consumers of different PLMNs, S-NSSAIs, SNPNs, NF-Domains etc. are different, it is not always possible for an NF (Service) Producer to register an authorization profile into NRF using allowedXXX parameters alone. The Allowed-ruleset feature addresses such requirements by extending the authorization policy with a prioritized list of RuleSets in the NF (Service) profile.\nThis clause provides configuration examples and guidance on handling backward compatibility when the Allowed-ruleset feature is deployed.\nC.2\tExamples of NF-Producer profile only using RuleSets (i.e. without AllowedXXX parameters) in NF (Service) Profile\nThis clause provides configuration examples of allowedScopesRuleSet parameter in the NF-Service profile (Clause 6.1.6.2.3).\nFollowing is an example of rules formed by para-phrasing the individual RuleSets registered by an NF-Service-Producer:\npriority 1 plmns <> nfTypes <> nfInstances <> scopes <> allow\npriority 2 plmns <> nfTypes <> scopes <> allow\npriority 3 plmns <> nfTypes <> allow\npriority 100 deny\nWhen a NF-Service-Consumer requests an access-token from NRF, the NRF matches the properties of the NF-Service-Consumer (PLMN, SNPN, nfType, NfDomain, S-NSSAIs, NF-Instance Id etc.) against these rules in decreasing order of priority (1 being the highest). If a match is found, search stops, and the matching rule is applied to determine the scope to be granted.\nConsider 3 NF-Service Producers p1, p2 and p3 who need to register their NF-Service Profile into NRF. Each of these producers define operation level scopes Op1, Op2 and Op3 and the service-level scope.\n-\tNF-Service-Producer p1 allows all NF-Service-Consumers with nfType=A to access its resources unrestricted. However NF-Service-Consumers with nfType=B are limited to Op1 and Op2. It may register, in the NF-Service-Profile:\npriority 2 nfType {B} scopes {Op1, Op2, service level scope} allow\npriority 5 nfType {A} allow\npriority 100 deny\n-\tNF-Service-Producer p2 allows all NF-Service-Consumers with nfType=A to access its resources unrestricted. NF-Service-Consumers with nfType=B are limited to Op1 and Op2. It additionally wants to allow NF-Service-Consumer with NF-Instance-ID=X to Op3 only. It may register, in the NF-Service-Profile:\npriority 2 nfInstance-id {X} scopes {Op3, service level scope} allow\npriority 5 nfType {B} scopes {Op1, Op2, service level scope} allow\npriority 10 nfType {A} allow\npriority 100 deny\n-\tNF-Service-Producer p3 allows all NF-Service-Consumers of PLMN1 of nfType=A or nfType=B to access its resources unrestricted. However, for the NFs of PLMN2, NF-Service-Consumers of nfType=A are allowed to access its resources unrestricted, but the NF-Service-Consumers of nfType=B are limited to Op1 and Op2. It may register, in the NF-Service-Profile:\npriority 2 plmn {plmn1} nfType {A,B} allow\npriority 5 plmn {plmn2} nfType {A} allow\npriority 10 plmn {plmn2} nfType {B} scopes {Op1, Op2, service level scope} allow\npriority 100 deny\nAbsence of scopes in a rule indicates that all service operations/all scopes are allowed.\nRule with no identification of NF-Consumer (e.g. priority 100 rule in example above) indicates the rule applies to all.\nSimilar examples apply to allowedRuleSet parameter in NF-Profile (Clause 6.1.6.2.2), however without the scopes parameter, as in the case of NF-Profile, the allowedRuleSet parameter is used to determine whether an NF-Consumer is allowed or not allowed to access the NF-Producer.\nC.3\tExample of NF-Producer profile using RuleSets and AllowedXXX parameters in NF (Service) Profile\nWhen a NF (Service) producer registers both the AllowedXXX parameters and the allowedScopesRuleSet parameter in the NF-Service Profile, the authorization scopes assigned to an NF-Consumer are determined by performing a logical OR operation of the two sets of parameters. The helps implementations to use Allowed-ruleset feature only when the authorization policy cannot be configured using the AllowedXXX parameters alone.\nThis clause provides configuration examples with allowedScopesRuleSet parameter in the NF-Service profile (Clause 6.1.6.2.3) along with allowedXXX parameters.\nConsider the example of NF-Service-Producer p3 in Annex C.2, which allows all NF-Service-Consumers of PLMN1 of nfType=A or nfType=B to access its resources unrestricted. However, for the NFs of PLMN2, NF-Service-Consumers of nfType=A are allowed to access its resources unrestricted, but the NF-Service-Consumers of nfType=B are limited to Op1 and Op2. This can be achieved by configuring the rules as:\n{\nallowedPLMNs = plmn1\nallowedNfTypes = A,B\n}\nOR\n{\npriority 5 plmn {plmn2} nfType {A} allow\npriority 10 plmn {plmn2} nfType {B} scopes {Op1, Op2, service level scope} allow\n}\nSimilar examples apply with allowedRuleSet parameter in NF-Profile (Clause 6.1.6.2.2), however without the scopes parameter, as in the case of NF-Profile, the allowedRuleSet parameter is used to determine whether an NF-Consumer is allowed or not allowed to access the NF-Producer.\nC.4\tBackward Compatibility\nThis clause provides examples for addressing backward compatibility issues with the Allowed-ruleset feature.\nConsider an NF-Producer p1 supporting Allowed-ruleset feature which registers its following NF-Service profile into NRF utilizing the new allowedScopesRuleSet parameter:\npriority 2 nfInstance-id {X} scopes {Op3, service level scope} allow\npriority 5 nfType {B} scopes {Op1, Op2, service level scope} allow\npriority 10 nfType {A} allow\npriority 15 nssais {1,2} scopes {Op1, service level scope} allow\npriority 100 deny\nConsider an NF-Consumer c1 which does not support the Allowed-ruleset feature and discovers NF-Producer p1 using Nnrf_NFDiscovery service.\n-\tIf the highest priority rule matching NF-Consumer c1 is priority 2, the NRF may include, in the Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Get response, parameter allowedOperationsPerNfInstance, containing applicable scopes.\n-\tIf the highest priority rule matching NF-Consumer c1 is priority 5, the NRF may include, in the Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Get response, parameter allowedOperationsPerNfType, containing applicable scopes.\n-\tIf the highest priority rule matching NF-Consumer c1 is priority 10, the NRF may not include, in the Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Get response, the parameters allowedOperationsPerNfInstance and allowedOperationsPerNfType.\n-\tIf the highest priority rule matching NF-Consumer c1 is priority 15, the NRF may include, in the Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Get response, any of the parameters allowedOperationsPerNfInstance or allowedOperationsPerNfType, containing applicable scopes.\nIf entities (e.g. SCP) of a network are configured to use Complete Profile Subscription or Complete Profile Discovery feature, the Allowed-ruleset feature shall only be deployed if all these entities in the network have been upgraded to support and use the Allowed-ruleset feature.\nNF-Producers shall only be configured to use the Allowed-ruleset feature after NRFs in the network are upgraded and configured to use the Allowed-ruleset feature, as otherwise NF-Producers would need to translate RuleSets to existing service access control parameters (i.e. allowedPlmns, allowedSnpns, allowedNfTypes etc.) which may not always be possible.\nAnnex D (normative):Support of \"Canary Release\" testing in the NRF\nThis feature allows a network operator to deploy new software features in a Network Function (NF) in a controlled manner, by isolating the NF (Service) Instances that implement the new features, and steering solely a part of the traffic that, otherwise, would be sent towards such NF (Service) Instance producer.\nThis is achieved by means of the following mechanisms:\n-\tSetting the NF (Service) Instance in Canary Release condition. This can be done by:\n-\tsetting the NFStatus, or NFServiceStatus, of the NF service producer, to the value \"CANARY_RELEASE\", or\n-\tsetting the \"canaryRelase\" attribute to true in the NFProfile or NFService, while keeping the NF(Service)Status as \"REGISTERED\"\n-\tDefining in the NFProfile or NFService of the NF service producer a set of selection conditions, that will be evaluated by an NF service consumer when attempting to select a candidate producer\nThe set of conditions may include, e.g.:\n-\tThe NF type of the consumer\n-\tA feature number that is required by the consumer to select (and send traffic to) a producer\n-\tA set of specific UEs (e.g. based on SUPI ranges, GPSI ranges, IMPU/IMPI ranges, list of PEIs)\n-\tAny UE camping on a TAI within a set of TAI ranges\n-\tA list of DNNs\nIn order to allow flexibility in the definition of the selection conditions, the above conditions can be combined by means of \"and\" / \"or\" logical operators.\nEXAMPLE:\tAn SMF is deployed with a new software feature, and the operator wishes to test it by carrying traffic to it with the following conditions:\n-\tThe SMF shall ony be selected by an AMF, a NEF, or an NWDAF\n-\tThe SMF shall only be selected by the AMF when:\n-\t its selection requires the support of the \"ATSSS\" feature (which corresponds with feature number #2 in the \"nsmf-pdusesssion\" service)\n-\tthe UE belongs to a certain range of SUPIs\n-\tthe UE is camping on a TAI belonging to a range of TAIs\n-\tWhen the SMF is selected by the NEF, it shall only do it for a certain DNN\n-\tWhen the SMF is selected by the NWDAF, it shall onlly do it when the UE is camping on a TAI belonging to a range of TAIs\nAn example of the \"selectionConditions\" attribute could be as follows (note that there might be different logical expressions to encode the same logic):\n\"selectionConditions\": {\n\"or\": [\n{\n\"and\": [\n{ \"consumerNfType\": [ \"AMF\" ] },\n{ \"serviceFeature\": 2 },\n{ \"supiRange\": { \"start\": \"1234511111\", \"end\": \"1234599999\" } },\n{ \"taiRange\": {\n\"plmnId\": { \"mcc\": \"123\", \"mnc\": \"45\" },\n\"tacRangeList\": [\n{ \"start\": \"000011\", \"end\": \"0000ff\" }\n]\n}\n}\n]\n},\n{\n\"and\": [\n{ \"consumerNfType\": [ \"NEF\" ] },\n{ \"dnnList\": [ \"internet.operator.com\" ] }\n]\n},\n{\n\"and\": [\n{ \"consumerNfType\": [ \"NWDAF\" ] },\n{ \"taiRange\": {\n\"plmnId\": { \"mcc\": \"123\", \"mnc\": \"45\" },\n\"tacRangeList\": [\n{ \"start\": \"000011\", \"end\": \"000022\" }\n]\n}\n}\n]\n}\n]\n}\nor, alternatively, with a more simplified encoding, based on the fact that the individual conditions (attributes) inside ConditionItem (see clause 6.1.6.2.124) are evaluated following the \"AND\" logical operator:\n\"selectionConditions\": {\n\"or\": [\n{\n\"consumerNfType\": [ \"AMF\" ],\n\"serviceFeature\": 2,\n\"supiRange\": { \"start\": \"1234511111\", \"end\": \"1234599999\" },\n\"taiRange\": {\n\"plmnId\": { \"mcc\": \"123\", \"mnc\": \"45\" },\n\"tacRangeList\": [\n{ \"start\": \"000011\", \"end\": \"0000ff\" }\n]\n}\n},\n{\n\"consumerNfType\": [ \"NEF\" ],\n\"dnnList\": [ \"internet.operator.com\" ]\n},\n{\n\"consumerNfType\": [ \"NWDAF\" ],\n\"taiRange\": {\n\"plmnId\": { \"mcc\": \"123\", \"mnc\": \"45\" },\n\"tacRangeList\": [\n{ \"start\": \"000011\", \"end\": \"000022\" }\n]\n}\n}\n]\n}\nOnce the producer has defined the selection conditions in its NFProfile, registered at the NRF, the sequence of steps for selection an NF after it is deployed with a \"canary\" software release, would be as follows:\n1.\tNF Service Instance to be software-upgraded changes its status to \"UNDISCOVERABLE\", and potential consumers are notified\n2.\tNF Service Instance gets progressively emptied of existing sessions, until no sessions remain\n3.\tNF Service Instance may optionally change its status to \"SUSPENDED\", to ensure that no residual traffic is sent to the NF Service Instance, and potential consumers are notified\n4.\tNF Service Instance is software-upgraded\n5.\tNF Service Instance with new software registers in NRF indicating its Canary Release condition, by setting its NF(Service)Status to \"CANARY_RELEASE\" or by setting the \"canaryRelease\" attribute to true while keeping its NF(Service)Status as \"REGISTERED\", and includes the set of conditions for selection (e.g. a SUPI range)\n6.\tConsumer NF sends discovery to NRF with usual discovery parameters and gets matching NF Instances containing NF Services with status \"REGISTERED\" or \"CANARY_RELEASE\"\n7.\tConsumer performs selection from the list of candidate NFs and, if the producer NF is in Canary Release condition, such NF shall only be selected if the selection conditions match (e.g. it shall only be selected if the SUPI matches the SUPI range indicated by the producer NF).\nThe selection of the candidate producers shall take into account the attributes of the discovered NFProfiles, and in addition, the consumer shall evaluate the attributes in the selection conditions, which shall take precedence over the attributes of the NFProfile of the producer, for those NF (Service) Instances in Canary Release condition.\nIf multiple candidate producers are available with NF (Service) status set to \"REGISTERED\" or \"CANARY_RELEASE\", the consumer shall preferably select a producer in \"CANARY_RELEASE\" status except if the \"exclusiveCanaryReleaseSelection\" attribute is present and set to true; in this case, the consumer shall only select producers in Canary Release condition (for which the selection conditions match), and shall not select those producers that are not in Canary Release condition.\nNOTE:\tIn the scenario of exclusive selection of Canary NF producers, the operator typically conducts very restricted Canary tests where the NF consumer only considers as valid candidate NF producer those instances in Canary condition, and discards all other NF producers (in non-Canary condition); the benefit of these tests is to check if the traffic case (for the selection conditions of the Canary nodes) actually end up in success or failure, rather than, e.g., ensuring that the traffic cases complete successfully after the consumer re-selects a non-Canary candidate producer. In these test scenarios, the operator need to ensure that the \"exclusiveCanaryReleaseSelection\" flag is consistently set in all the Canary NF producers; otherwise, the consumer can send traffic exclusively to Canary NF producers as long as there is one instance among the candidate producers having the \"exclusiveCanaryReleaseSelection\" set to true.\nFor the case of Indirect Communication, the selection of a candidate producer may be done by the SCP. In that case, the SCP needs to be able to evaluate the selection conditions for those producers in Canary Release condition. Since the SCP does not count with this information at its disposal (e.g. the different identities of the UE for which a service request is invoked via the SCP), it shall be provided by the consumer, e.g. by including the \"3gpp-Sbi-Correlation-Info\" HTTP header or by including the corresponding discovery headers (\"3ggp-Sbi-Discovery\") containing the UE identities involved in the specific traffic case.\nIn certain cases, the operator may want to maintain the NF Instance fully operative (so it keeps serving traffic to any consumer), at the same time as testing the new software features; in such case, the operator may deploy distinct service instances, some of which may keep the old software version and keep the \"REGISTERED\" NFServiceStatus, while other service instances may be deployed with the new software version, and set the NFServiceStatus to \"CANARY_RELEASE\", to ensure that it is only selected by consumers when the desired conditions are met.\nAnother alternative approach to maintain the node fully operative may be achieved by setting the \"canaryRelease\" indication to true in the NFProfile or NFService of the NF (Service) instance, while keeping both the NFStatus and NFServiceStatus as \"REGISTERED\". This way, all consumers that do not support the Canary Release feature will keep discovering and potentially selecting such NF (Service) instance, so it will keep serving traffic normally for legacy consumers; however, if the consumer supports the Canary Release feature, it shall check the \"canaryRelease\" flag and, if set to true, it shall evaluate the selection conditions, similarly as if the NF(Service)Status would be set to \"CANARY_RELEASE\".\nAn SCP or SEPP Network Entities may be set under Canary Release condition and define a set of selection conditions at NFProfile level to indicate to potential consumers that such Network Entity (SCP or SEPP) should only be selected if the selection conditions match.\nGiven that there are no services defined for an SCP, it is not possible to have an SCP \"operative\" (i.e. to be able to serve traffic to any consumer) when the status is set to \"CANARY_RELEASE\" and the consumers might not support the \"CANARY_RELEASE\" feature. However, it is possible to keep the SCP operative (and serve traffic to consumers not supporting such feature) by setting the \"canaryRelease\" attribute to true in the NFProfile of the SCP, and keep the NFStatus as \"REGISTERED\".\nFor a SEPP, the same considerations as with SCP apply, since there are no SEPP services per-se, in relation to the selection of SEPP instances, and the invocation of its N32-related message transfer capabilities.\nHowever, a SEPP Network Entity may set the NFServiceStatus of a \"nsepp-telescopic\" service instance (while keeping the NFStatus of the SEPP set to \"REGISTERED\"). In this case, it is possible to have several instances of this service deployed, where some of them have the NFServiceStatus set to \"REGISTERED\" (and any consumer may select them) and others set to \"CANARY_RELEASE\", so consumers should only select such service instance when the selection conditions match.\nAnnex E (informative):Change
