An untrusted AF shall only be allowed to access NSACF services via NEF. If multiple NSACFs are deployed in the network and the trusted AF is interested in the aggregated report, then the trusted AF collects the report from NEF, instead of contacting multiple NSACFs directly.\n4.1A\tNSAC Architecture Options\nIf the network is configured with a single NSAC service area, there is a single NSACF deployed to handle the admissions for an S-NSSAI.\nIf the network is configured with multiple NSAC service areas, one of the three NSAC architecture options, i.e. non-hierarchical NSAC architecture, centralized NSAC architecture and hierarchical NSAC architecture (as specified in clause 5.15.11.0 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [2]), may be selected to handle the admissions for an S-NSSAI based on operator’s policy.\nIn different NSAC architectures, there are different roles of NSACFs as:\n-\tindependent NSACFs are deployed in each NSAC service area in non-hierarchical NSAC architecture;\n-\ta single centralized NSACF is deployed in the whole network in centralized NSAC architecture; and\n-\ta primary NSACF and several distributed NSACFs are deployed in hierarchical NSAC architecture.\nFor the hierarchical NSAC architecture, the NSACF role (i.e. primary NSACF or distributed NSACF) is configured in the NSACF per S-NSSAI (e.g. a NSACF may act as primary NSACF for a first S-NSSAI and as a distributed NSACF for a second S-NSSAI). For the same S-NSSAI, the role of primary and distributed NSACFs can be co-located at the same NSACF instance. A NSACF acting as a Primary NSACF for a given S-NSSAI handles overall NSAC for the S-NSSAI at the global level (i.e. it is ultimately responsible for the NSAC for an S-NSSAI).

If the access type is not configured for NSAC for the indicated S-NSSAI, the NSACF shall skip the above handling for increasing/decreasing the number of UEs and return successful handling for this S-NSSAI. If the access type is configured for NSAC for the indicated S-NSSAI, the NSACF shall perform the above handling taking the access type into account and record/remove the UE registration associated with the access type. If the total number of UEs will exceed the maximum number of UEs allowed to be registered to this slice, the NSACF shall record this S-NSSAI in the failed list of S-NSSAI in the response message, together with an appropriate value of AcuFailureReason (e.g. \"EXCEED_MAX_UE_NUM\" as specified in clause 6.1.6.3.5).\nIf the NSACF is not configured to perform per access type network slice admission control, the NSACF may perform network slice admission control without taking access type into account. For example, the NSACF is configured with a total quota for the PLMN, but the network slice admission control is not specific to one access type. The NSACF shall record the access type(s) associated with the UE registration. The NSACF shall remove the corresponding UE registration entry when the UE deregisters from all access types.\nNOTE 2:\tFor each S-NSSAI that is applicable for NSAC, the NSACF is configured with a total quota for the PLMN. However, the network slice admission control may be configured to apply for one specific access type or both access types.\nIf in above NSACF handling not all S-NSSAIs are successful, \"200 OK\" shall be returned, with necessary response data indicating the failed S-NSSAI and the failure reason, e.g. \"EXCEED_MAX_UE_NUM\".\nIf in above NSACF handling all S-NSSAIs are successful, \"204 No Content\" shall be returned which could represent the maximum number of UEs for the S-NSSAI not reached.\nIf the NSACF is configured with multiple NSAC Service Areas and is further configured to perform NSAC admission on a per NSAC service area granularity, the NSACF shall perform the NSAC admission against the received NSAC service area in the request.\nNOTE 3:\tIf the PLMN has multiple NSAC service areas and there are multiple NSACFs deployed for the network slice, each NSACF may be configured with the maximum number of UEs of the network slice within its service area, e.g. as per operator policy. If hierarchical NSAC architecture is deployed, how to synchronize the threshold among the primary NSACF and distributed NSACFs is specified in clause 5.2.2.2.3 and clause 5.2.2.5.2. Otherwise, how to split or synchronize the threshold in multiple NSACFs is left to implementation, and how to guarantee session continuity when a UE moves to new NSAC service area with a different NSACF is also left to implementation.\nNOTE 4:\tIf the NF Service Consumer is AMF, the NSACF may subscribe to AMF Status Change Notifications (e.g. AMF unavailability) via the NRF and update the NF ID accordingly, as described in clause 4.2.11.2 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3].\nWhen the NF Service Consumer subscribes to the EAC Notification for the first time, the NSACF shall immediately send an EAC notification (see clause 5.2.2.3.2) towards the NF consumer including the most recent EAC Modes for the subscribed S-NSSAIs.\n2b.\tOn failure, the appropriate HTTP status code (e.g. \"403 Forbidden\") indicating the error shall be returned.\nA ProblemDetails IE shall be included in the content of POST response, with the \"cause\" attribute of ProblemDetails set to application error codes specified in table 6.1.3.2.3.1-1.\nNOTE 5:\tIf the NF Service Consumer provided the EAC notification callback URI, the NSACF can handle the EAC notification implicit subscription independently of the result of the UE NSAC activities, i.e. even the NSAC actions for all the S-NSSAIs are failed for the UE(s) and negative response is sent to the AMF, the NSACF can still store the EAC notification subscription and send EAC notification(s) to the AMF.\n2c.\tOn redirection, \"307 Temporary Redirect\" or \"308 Permanent Redirect\" shall be returned. A RedirectResponse IE shall be included in the content of POST response.\nWhen the procedure is used to perform admission control for a number of UEs, when e.g. NSAC is enabled or disabled for an already live slice, then based on operator policy AMF may allow or disallow sessions for which NSACF returned a reject.",

At the end of the Network Slice Replacement, one AcuOperationItem indicates the replaced S-NSSAI with the updateFlag set to \"INCREASE\" and another AcuOperationItem indicates the alternative S-NSSAI with the updateFlag set to \"DECREASE\").\nIf the replaced S-NSSAI and alternative S-NSSAI are served by different NSACFs (e.g. in distributed NSACF deployment scenario), separate requests (i.e. one targeting the replaced S-NSSAI and the other targeting the alternative S-NSSAI) to corresponding NSACF may be triggered.\nIf the replaced S-NSSAI is associated with one specific access type, the same access type shall be indicated (i.e. in the UeAcRequestInfo specified in clause 6.1.6.2.9) for the alternative S-NSSAI, e.g. in the case if two separate requests are invoked for the purpose either to the same NSACF or to different NSACFs.\n2a.\tFor each S-NSSAI included in PduACRequestData, the NSACF shall perform the following actions:\n-\tif the update flag is set to \"INCREASE\", the NSACF shall check whether the PDU session is already recorded in the PDU registration list in the NSACF and whether the total number of PDU sessions to this slice will exceed the maximum number of PDU sessions allowed to be registered to this slice:\n-\tif the PDU session (identified by the UE ID and the PDU session ID) is already recorded in the PDU registration list, the NSACF shall skip recording this PDU session and shall not increase the total number of PDU sessions established to this network slice;\n-\tif the PDU session is not recorded in the PDU registration list and the total number of PDU sessions (including the PDU session indicated in the request and the PDU sessions already stored in the NSACF) does not exceed the maximum number of PDU sessions allowed to be registered to this slice, the NSACF records the PDU session to the PDU registration list stored in the NSACF, and updates the total number of PDU sessions registered to this slice accordingly;\n-\tif the PDU session is not recorded in the PDU registration list and if the total number of PDU sessions will exceed the maximum number of PDU sessions allowed to be registered to this slice, the NSACF shall not record the PDU session into the PDU registration list stored in the NSACF, and shall not update the total number of PDU sessions. Instead, the NSACF shall record this S-NSSAI in the failed list of S-NSSAI in the response message, together with an appropriate value of AcuFailureReason (e.g. \"EXCEED_MAX_PDU_NUM\" as specified in clause 6.1.6.3.5);\n-\tif the update flag is set to \"DECREASE\" and if the PDU session is recorded in the PDU registration list, the NSACF decreases the total number of PDU sessions registered to this slice, and removes the indicated PDU session from the PDU registration list stored in the NSACF.\n-\tif the update flag is set to \"DECREASE\" and if the PDU session is not recorded in the PDU registration list, the NSACF shall not decrease the total number of PDU sessions registered to this slice and shall return successful handling for this PDU registration.\n-\tif the update flag is set to \"UPDATE\", the NSACF shall locate the existing entry in the PDU registration list and update the access type associated to the PDU session to which indicated in the request message.\nThe NSACF may be configured to perform per access type network slice admission control. In this case, the NSACF shall check whether the access type provided by the NF Service Consumer is configured for NSAC for the indicated S-NSSAI to control the number of PDU sessions. If the access type is not configured for NSAC for the indicated S-NSSAI, the NSACF shall skip the above handling for increasing/decreasing the number of PDU sessions and shall return successful handling for this S-NSSAI. If the access type is configured for NSAC for the indicated S-NSSAI, the NSACF shall perform the above handling taking the access type into account. If the update flag is set to \"UPDATE\", the NSACF shall first increase the number of PDU sessions for the new access type, and if successful then decrease the number of PDU sessions for the old access type. If the total number of PDU sessions will exceed the maximum number of PDU sessions allowed to be registered to this slice, the AcuFailureReason shall indicate the applied access type (e.g. \"EXCEED_MAX_PDU_NUM_3GPP\" or \"EXCEED_MAX_PDU_NUM_N3GPP\" as specified in clause 6.1.6.3.5).\nIf the NSACF is not configured to perform per access type network slice admission control, the NSACF may perform network slice admission control without taking access type into account. For example, the NSACF is configured with a total quota for the PLMN, but the network slice admission control is not specific to one access type. The NSACF shall record the access type(s) associated with the PDU registration. The NSACF shall remove the PDU registration entry when the PDU session is released from all access types.\nNOTE 1:\tFor each S-NSSAI that is applicable for NSAC, the NSACF is configured with a total quota for the PLMN. However, the network slice admission control may be configured to apply for one specific access type or both access types.\nIf in above NSACF handling not all S-NSSAIs are successful, \"200 OK\" shall be returned, with necessary response data, e.g. indicating the failed S-NSSAI(s).\nIf in above NSACF handling all S-NSSAIS are successful, \"204 No Content\" shall be returned.\nIf the NSACF is configured with multiple NSAC Service Areas and is further configured to perform NSAC admission on a per NSAC service area granularity, the NSACF shall perform the NSAC admission against the received NSAC service area in the request.\nNOTE 2:\tIf the PLMN has NSAC multiple service areas and there are multiple NSACFs deployed for the network slice, each NSACF may be configured with the maximum number of PDU Sessions of the network slice within its service area, e.g. as per operator policy. If hierarchical NSAC architecture is deployed, how to synchronize the threshold among the primary NSACF and distributed NSACFs is specified in clause 5.2.2.4.3 and clause 5.2.2.5.2. Otherwise, how to split or synchronize the threshold in multiple NSACFs is left to implementation, and how to guarantee session continuity when a UE moves to new NSAC service area with a different NSACF is also left to implementation.\n2b.\tOn failure, the appropriate HTTP status code (e.g. \"403 Forbidden\") indicating the error shall be returned.\nA ProblemDetails IE shall be included in the content of POST response, with the \"cause\" attribute of ProblemDetails set to application error codes specified in table 6.1.3.3.3.1-3.\n2c.\tOn redirection, \"307 Temporary Redirect\" or \"308 Permanent Redirect\" shall be returned. A RedirectResponse shall be included in the content of POST response.\nWhen the procedure is used to perform admission control for a number of PDU sessions, when e.g. NSAC is enabled or disabled for an already live slice, then based on operator policy, SMF may allow or disallow sessions for which NSACF returned a reject.",

Therefore, if a UE/PDU session is rejected by NSACF, then the reports generated by the NSACF would not have counts of those UEs/PDU-Sessions, despite the UEs accessing the corresponding slice(s). Alternatively, the NF Service Consumer (i.e. the AMF or the SMF) may not invoke the corresponding NSAC procedure for the exempted UE/PDU Session, i.e. those UEs/PDU Sessions are not counted towards the maximum number of UEs/PDU Sessions (see clause 5.15.11.0 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [2]).",

Once the subscription expires, if the NF Service Consumer wants to keep receiving notifications, it shall create a new subscription in the NSACF. The NSACF shall not provide the same expiry time for many subscriptions in order to avoid all of them expiring and recreating the subscription at the same time. If the expiry time is not included in the response, the NF Service Consumer shall consider the subscription to be valid without an expiry time.\nIf the immediateFlag attribute is set to \"true\" in the request message, the NSACF shall include the current number of UEs or PDU Sessions per network slice in the response immediately.\nIf the NSACF supports the EEMM feature and the \"notifFlag\" attribute is included and set to \"DEACTIVATE\" in the request by e.g. the NWDAF or DCCF, the NSACF shall mute the event notification and store the available events. Additionally, if the NF service consumer also included event muting instructions in the request, the NSACF should evaluate the received event muting instructions against to local actions (if configured) and, if the subscription creation request is accepted, the NSACF may indicate the following information to the NF service consumer in the response:\n-\tthe maximum number of notifications that the NSACF expects to be able to store for the subscription;\n-\tan estimate of the duration for which notifications can be buffered.\n2b.\tOn failure, the appropriate HTTP status code (e.g. \"403 Forbidden\") shall be returned.\nA ProblemDetails IE shall be included in the content of POST response, with the \"cause\" attribute of ProblemDetails set to application error codes specified in table 6.2.3.2.3.1-3.\n2c.\tOn redirection, \"307 Temporary Redirect\" or \"308 Permanent Redirect\" shall be returned.
