In order to avoid inconsistency of time due to different timezones, lastReplicationTime, recoveryTime and lastSynchronizationTime shall be identified using UTC.\nUDR consumers and UDM consumers define callbackUri for data restoration in their NF profile. This is an endpoint to receive notification when potential UDR data inconsistency occurs. In addition, UDR consumers may inform their identity to UDR. Additionally, UDM consumers may inform their dataRestorationCallbackUri to UDM during registration in UDM (e.g. for AMF, SMF, SMSF); if so, such callback URI shall be the same as the URI registered by the UDM consumer in its NF Profile in NRF, and it shall be a same URI for the entire consumer's NF Instance (i.e., the UDM consumer shall not indicate different callback URIs per each UE registration).\nWhen the UDR detects a potential data inconsistency of temporary data, the UDR notifies the UDR consumers of the potential data inconsistency event using the callbackUri of the UDR consumer.\nThe UDM may notify UDM consumers within its PLMN using the callbackUri included in the NF profile of the UDM consumer in NRF. This is, a UDM that receives a notification from UDR can discover the callbackURI of e.g. AMFs, SMFs, SMSFs or AUSFs within its PLMN and forward the notification to all of them. The UDM may also notify UDM consumers using the callbackUri if provided by UDM consumers during its registration in UDM based on local configuration.\nNOTE 2:\tThe option for UDM consumers to provide its dataRestorationCallbackUri during registration in UDM, and such UDM using these callbackUris to send subsequent notifications, is particularly beneficial to support roaming users connecting via UDM consumers in PLMNs different from the PLMN of the UDM (e.g. AMF, SMSF, and SMF in Local Break Out scenarios), since it avoids the task for UDM to perform an inter-PLMN service discovery.\nThe notification to UDR consumers and UDM consumers includes optionally the identifier of the temporary data subject to restoration (e.g. Reset-IDs), the lastReplicationTime and the recoveryTime. The UDR consumer or UDM consumer may then initiate the restoration of the temporary data identified to be potentially lost or corrupted when the last synchronization time recorded at consumer falls between the lastReplicationTime and the recoveryTime as provided by the producer, i.e. UDR or UDM.",

      "content": "Figure 6.7.2-1 describes the procedure for restoration of profiles related to UDR.\nFigure 6.7.2-1: Restoration of Profiles related to UDR\n0.\tUDR consumers and UDM consumers define callbackUri for data restoration in the NF profile registered in NRF.\n1.\tUDR consumers store temporary data in UDR. The UDR consumers may set its identity in the request to UDR, when accessing it for the first time. The UDR stores the received identity and creates for the UDR consumer a subscription on notification for the potential UDR data inconsistency. The UDR may provide to the UDR consumer the Reset-ID if assigned by the UDR for the temporary data stored in UDR.\nThe UDM stores temporary data in UDR as requested by its consumers. UDM consumers may set dataRestorationCallbackUri in the request of their registration to UDM. In this case, the UDM stores the dataRestorationCallbackUri locally and creates for the UDM consumer a subscription on notification for the potential UDR data inconsistency. If received from UDR, the UDM also provides the Reset-ID assigned by the UDR to UDM consumers.\nWhen an NF other than UDM creates or updates a resource directly or via UDM in UDR, the NF sets or stores lastSynchronizationTime in a relevant profile. If the NF receives a Reset-ID directly or via UDM from UDR, the NF stores it in the profile.\n2.\tUDR detects corruption, loss, or inconsistency in temporary data caused due to certain scenarios (e.g. failure and restart of the UDR, or migration of the data from an old UDR to a new UDR).\nNOTE 1:\tThe UDR can recover consistency by different means, e.g. by reloading data from its back-up.\n3.\tUDR queries NRF based on the identity stored in step 1 and discovers callbackUri for data restoration in UDR consumers' NF profiles. If no UDR consumer impacted by the restoration event provided its identity in step 1, the UDR discovers via NRF the callbackUri of one suitable UDR consumer instance to send the notification to. The UDR sends Nudr_DR_Notification request to the callbackUri to notify potential UDR data inconsistency. The Nudr_DR_Notification request may contain temporary data identifier(s) (e.g. Reset-IDs) and an impacted period (i.e. lastReplicationTime and recoveryTime).\n4.\tIf UDR consumer is UDM, the UDM forwards the notification to UDM consumers. The UDM finds callbackUri for data restoration for UDM consumers within its PLMN in UDM consumers' NF profiles through querying NRF. Optionally, the UDM may find callbackUri for data restoration for UDM consumers (especially UDM consumers outside its PLMN) if provided by the UDM consumer during UDM consumer registration in UDM and locally stored in UDM in step1.\n5.\tWhen a UDR consumer other than UDM (e.g. PCF, NEF) or a UDM consumer (e.g. AMF, SMF, SMSF) finds that a stored profile is affected by the potential loss or corruption of data, and that the last synchronization time of the profile falls into the impacted period in the notification, then the NF judges that the profile requires re-synchronization.\nUDR consumers other than UDM (e.g. PCF, NEF) initiates the re-synchronization of the impacted resources using Nudr_DataRepository service operations.\nUDM consumers initiate the re-synchronization for each impacted UE using different service operations depending on the UDM consumer type. UDM consumers shall include a flag (\"udrRestartInd\") indicating that the request is due to a re-synchronization event.\n-\tUDM consumers that register in UDM start re-synchronization by sending Nudm_UECM_Registration request for each impacted UE.\nIn order to prevent storing obsolete registration information for a given user coming from UDM consumers that trigger resynchronization for the same user, UDM consumers may include the stored last synchronization time within the re-synchronization request. The lastSynchronizationTime provided by the UDM consumer may be used in UDM to compare it with current data stored in UDR and ensure that the registration from the most recent UDM consumer is kept (see step 7). However, if the UDM consumer ensures that its resynchronization is the most recent, accurate and correct (e.g. if the AMF triggers resynchronization upon detection of UE activity), the UDM consumer shall not include the lastSynchronizationTime within the resynchronization request and the UDM stores the UDM consumer registration in the UDR without further processing.\n-\tUDM consumers that subscribe to notification of subscription data changes in UDM start re-synchronization of these subscriptions in UDM by sending Nudm_SDM_Subscribe request for each impacted UE and subscription.\n-\tAUSF starts re-synchronization by sending Nudm_UEAuthentication_ResultConfirmation request containing the stored last synchronization timestamp of the authentication for each impacted UE.\n-\tNEF starts re-synchronization of the subscription to exposure events in UDM by sending Nudm_EE_ModifySubscription request for each impacted UE and subscribed event.\n6.\tThe UDR consumers and UDM consumers locally adjusts invocation timing of each of those procedures, in order not to cause congestion in the system. The NF invokes necessary procedures.\nUDM consumers select a UDM instance to send the re-synchronization signalling as defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [9]. This is, the UDM consumer may not send the re-synchronization signalling to the UDM instance from which the UDM consumer received the notification.\n7.\tIf UDM receives Nudm_UECM_Registration request containing the \"udrRestartInd\" flag, the UDM overwrites the related profile in the UDR, or creates it if not available. If the registration request includes a lastSynchronizationTime, the related profile in UDR is overwritten only if the lastSynchronization time received from the UDM consumer is not older than the registration time stored in UDR before resynchronization. In this case, if the UDM replaces or creates the related profile in UDR, the UDM sets the registration time to the current time.\nIf UDM receives Nudm_SDM_Subscribe request containing the \"udrRestartInd\" flag the UDM sends a corresponding request to UDR, the UDR overwrites the related profile in the UDR or creates it if not available in UDR.\nIf UDM receives Nudm_UEAuthentication_ResultConfirmation request containing the \"udrRestartInd\" flag, the UDM sends a corresponding request to UDR, the UDR overwrites the related profile in the UDR or creates it if not available in UDR.\nIf UDM receives Nudm_EE_ModifySubscription request containing the \"udrRestartInd\" flag, the UDM sends a corresponding request to UDR, the UDR overwrites the related profile in the UDR or creates it if not available in UDR.",

In this case, the MB-SMF shall remove this NG RAN node from its MBS session context.\nNOTE 3:\tThis avoids that the MB-SMF requests an AMF to send requests to NG RAN nodes that have failed or restarted, i.e. that have no more shared delivery established.\nIn scenarios where the MB-SMF would request an AMF to distribute an activate, deactivate or update request to a NG RAN node that has no longer shared delivery established (e.g. the NG RAN node has restarted but this has not been detected by the MB-SMF), the NG RAN will return an activation or update failure to the AMF. To enable the MB-SMF to be notified about this failure and to remove the NG RAN node ID from its MBS session context, the MB-SMF shall include a notification URI in every Namf_MBSCommunication_N2MessageTransfer Request it sends and the AMF shall notify a failure received from an NG RAN node towards the MB-SMF by sending an Namf_MBSCommunication_Notify request to the notification URI that was received in the request.\nLikewise, if an AMF receives an Namf_MBSCommunication_N2MessageTransfer Request including a NG RAN Node ID and the AMF cannot send any N2 message towards this NG RAN node (e.g. the NG-RAN node has failed without restart), the AMF shall notify the failure to send N2 MBS session requests to the NG RAN node by sending an Namf_MBSCommunication_Notify request to the notification URI that was received in the request.\nNOTE 4:\tWhen IP multicast is used over N3mb, the MB-SMF cannot detect via the MB-UPF that a NG RAN node has failed or restarted. So in this case, and also possibly even when using unicast transport, it can occur that the MB-SMF requests the AMF to send an activate, deactivate or update request to an NG RAN node that has no longer shared delivery established.",

If the TSCTSF instance is deployed within an TSCTSF set, the failure with or without restart of a TSCSTF instance is seamless for the AMF and NG-RANs, and the AMF forwards the TSS reports to an alternative TSCTSF of the TSCTSF set. The alternative TSCSTF can then stop the reporting of TSS information, when needed, by sending a NGAP Timing Synchronization Status Request message requesting NG-RANs to stop TSS information reporting with the Routing ID set to the TSCTSF ID that was used to start the reporting.\nNOTE 2:\tThe AMF can determine whether the TSCTSF is deployed in a TSCTSF set by receiving binding information from the TSCTSF during the creation of the NonUeN2Info subscription, or from the NF profile of the TSCTSF.\nWhen a TSCTSF instance fails with or without restart, the subscription(s) for TSS information reporting activated in one or more NG-RANs, including the non-UE specific N2 information subscription in the AMF(s), are lost at the TSCTSF if the TSCTSF is not deployed within an TSCTSF set.\nThe AMF may detect the failure of the TSCTSF instance with or without restart by using the procedures defined in clauses 6.2 and 6.3.\nUpon detecting that a TSCTSF instance which subscribed to the AMF to receive subsequent TSS reports, has failed with or without restart, and no alternative TSCTSF instance can be reselected, the AMF may:\n-\tdelete the non-UE specific N2 information subscription from the TSCTSF instance locally and stop forwarding any subsequent report to the failed TSCTSF; and\n-\tsend an NGAP Timing Synchronization Status Request message with the Routing Id set to the failed TSCTSF NF ID to stop TSS reporting on behalf of the failed TSCTSF, towards NG-RAN(s) from which the AMF receives an NGAP TSS Report message intended for the failed TSCTSF (i.e. for a TSCTSF for which no non-UE specific N2 information subscription exists at the AMF), to avoid possible hanging TSS reporting in the NG-RAN(s).\nAlternatively, based on the AMF implementation, the AMF may do the above (i.e. delete the non-UE specific N2 information subscription and request the NG-RAN to stop reporting TSS information for the failed TSCTSF) upon forwarding TSS reports to the TSCSTF and receiving no responses from the TSCTSF or receiving application errors \"RESOURCE_CONTEXT_NOT_FOUND\" or \"SUBSCRIPTION_NOT_FOUND in the NonUeN2Info Notify Response message.\nAnnex A (informative):Change
