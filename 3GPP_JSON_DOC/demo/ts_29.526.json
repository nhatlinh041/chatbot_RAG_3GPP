The NSSAAF may relay the EAP message to an AAA-S and collect the result of slice-specific authentication and authorization from the AAA-S, as specified in clause 4.2.9.2 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], and clause 16.3 of 3GPP TS 33.501 [8].\nThe NF Service Consumer (i.e. the AMF) shall send a POST request to the resource representing slice authentication collection (i.e. …/slice-authentications) to request the NSSAAF to create the corresponding resource context and perform slice-specific authentication and authorization.\nFigure 5.2.2.2.1-1: Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization\n1.\tThe NF Service Consumer (AMF) shall send a POST request to the NSSAAF, targeting the resource of slice authentication collection (i.e. …/slice-authentications), to perform slice-specific authentication and authorization.\nThe HTTP content shall contain the slice authentication information, which includes:\n-\tUE ID (i.e. GPSI), if multiple GPSIs received from the UDM, the NF Service Consumer shall include any one of the GPSIs.\n-\tS-NSSAI\n-\tEAP ID Response message (if it is received from the UE), or the EAP ID Response message with EAP ID stored, or the EAP ID Response message with Null value (if EAP ID is not requested or received);\n-\toptionally, the callback URI of the AMF to receive re-authentication notification from the NSSAAF;\n-\toptionally, the callback URI of the AMF to receive revocation notification from the NSSAAF.\nBased on local policy, the AMF may determine to provide callback URI(s) for receiving re-authentication notification or revocation notification. For example, the callback URIs are provided for an UE identified with low mobility characteristic.\nIf Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization is triggered by the AMF during a Registration procedure as described in clause 4.2.9.2 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], the AMF shall set \"status\" attribute for the given slice listed in \"nssaaStatusList\" attribute to \"PENDING\" (See 3GPP TS 29.518 [16]).\n2.\tThe NSSAAF creates slice authentication context for the UE, and starts the slice-specific authentication and authorization procedure. If the AAA-S is involved in slice-specific authentication and authorization procedure, the NSSAAF shall forward the EAP ID Response message to the AAA-S if the EAP ID Response message does not contain the Null value. Depending on the result, either step 3a or step 3b is performed. The NSSAAF obtains the AAA-S address from local configuration, based on S-NSSAI.\n3a.\tOn success, \"201 Created\" shall be returned. The \"Location\" header shall contain the URI of the created resource (e.g. .../slice-authentications/{authCtxId}). The content shall contain the slice authentication context, which includes the EAP message generated by the NSSAAF or from the AAA-S. The NF Service Consumer (i.e. the AMF) shall forward the received EAP message to the UE in NAS message, as specified in clause 4.2.9.2 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3].\n3b.\tOn failure, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table 6.1.7.3-1 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body containing a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of the application error listed in Table 6.1.7.3-1. If the slice is not authorized, the NSSAAF shall use the \"SLICE_AUTH_REJECTED\" application error code.\n3c.\tOn redirection, the appropriate HTTP status code (e.g. \"307 Temporary Redirect\") shall be returned. A RedirectResponse IE may be included in the content of POST response, as specified in table 6.1.3.2.3.1-3.\n4.\tOnce receiving EAP message from the UE, the NF Service Consumer (i.e. the AMF) shall send a PUT request to the NSSAAF, targeting the resource of the slice authentication context (i.e. …/slice-authentications/{authCtxId}).\nThe HTTP content shall carry the slice authentication confirmation data which includes:\n-\tUE ID (i.e. GPSI)\n-\tS-NSSAI\n-\tEAP Message (which is received from the UE)\n5.\tThe NSSAAF checks and confirms the slice-specific authentication and authorization. If the AAA-S is involved, the NSSAAF shall forward the EAP Message to the AAA-S to confirm the slice-specific authentication and authorization. Depending on the result, either step 6a or step 6b is performed.\n6a.\tOn success, \"200 OK\" shall be returned. The content shall contain the slice authentication confirmation response, which includes the EAP message (e.g. EAP success/failure message) generated by the NSSAAF or from the AAA-S. The NF Service Consumer (i.e. the AMF) shall forward the EAP message to the UE in NAS message.\nIf the UE is authenticated, the NSSAAF shall set the \"authResult\" attribute to \"EAP_SUCCESS\". If failed to authenticate the UE, the \"authResult\" attribute shall be set to \"EAP_FAILURE\".\nIf subsequent EAP message exchange is needed between the UE and the NSSAAF(AAA-S), the NSSAAF shall not include SliceAuthResult in the response message.\n6b.\tOn failure, one of the HTTP status codes listed in Table 6.1.7.3-1 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body containing a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of the application error listed in Table 6.1.7.3-1.\n6c.\tOn redirection, the appropriate HTTP status code (e.g. \"307 Temporary Redirect\") shall be returned. A RedirectResponse IE may be included in the content of POST response, as specified in table 6.1.3.3.3.1-3.\n7-9.\tIf subsequent EAP message exchange is needed between the UE and the NSSAAF to finish the EAP based authentication, step 7-9 are performed. On failure, one of the HTTP status codes listed in Table 6.1.7.3-1 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body containing a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of the application error listed in Table 6.1.7.3-1. On redirection, the appropriate HTTP status code (e.g. \"307 Temporary Redirect\") shall be returned, and a RedirectResponse IE may be included in the message body, as specified in table 6.1.3.3.3.1-3.\nIn above steps, if the AAA-S is involved in the slice-specific authentication and authorization procedure while there is no expected response from the AAA-S in the case of time out, the NSSAAF shall return HTTP status code \"504 Gateway Timeout\", with the message body containing a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to \"TIMED_OUT_REQUEST\".\nAfter the completion of slice-specific authentication and authorization procedure, it is up to implementation whether the NSSAAF stores the slice authentication context and related resources for a configured period, or deletes the context and resource immediately, e.g. depending on the potential need for AAA-S initiated slice-specific re-authentication/revocation notification.\nIf the slice-specific authentication and authorization was successful (i.e. \"authResult\" attribute received from NSSAAF in step 6a is set to \"EAP_SUCCESS\"), the AMF shall set \"status\" attribute for the given slice listed in \"nssaaStatusList\" attribute to \"EAP_SUCCESS\" (see 3GPP TS 29.518 [16]).\nIf the slice-specific authentication and authorization finally fails (i.e. \"authResult\" attribute received from NSSAAF in step 6a is set to \"EAP_FAILURE\"), the AMF shall set \"status\" attribute for the given slice listed in \"nssaaStatusList\" attribute to \"EAP_FAILURE\" (see 3GPP TS 29.518 [16]). In this case, if there are PDU sessions previously established corresponding to the S-NSSAIs required to be authenticated, the AMF should additionally trigger the release of those PDU sessions.\nIf the slice-specific authentication and authorization cannot be completed, then:\n-\tIf it is due to receiving a response with HTTP status code \"504 Gateway Timeout\" or due to lack of response from the NSSAAF during an NSSAA procedure, the AMF may later re-initiate slice-specific authentication and authorization procedure based on its policy. The AMF should wait for a configured period before re-initiating slice-specific authentication and authorization procedure. If the retry attempts are exhausted, the AMF stops the slice-specific authentication and authorization procedure.\nNOTE 1:\tIt is recommended to limit the number of retry attempts as described in 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].\n-\tIf it is due to the UE becoming unreachable during an NSSAA procedure, the AMF stops the slice-specific authentication and authorization procedure.\n-\tIf the AMF stops the slice-specific authentication and authorization procedure (i.e. after exhausting the retry attempts or when the UE becomes unreachable), the AMF shall keep the \"status\" attribute set to \"PENDING\", for the given slice(s) listed in \"nssaaStatusList\" attribute (see 3GPP TS 29.518 [16]).\nNOTE 2:\tThe AMF initiates the slice-specific authentication and authorization for S-NSSAIs in \"PENDING\" status at next UE uplink activity.\nIf an S-NSSAI subject to the NSSAA is rejected due to Network Slice Admission Control as the total number of UEs exceeds the maximum number of UEs allowed to be registered to this slice as specified in clause 5.2.2.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.536 [17]), the AMF shall keep the \"status\" attribute stored as not impacted (see clause 4.2.9.1 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] and 3GPP TS 29.518 [16]).",

If the AAA-S is authorized to request the revocation, the NSSAAF shall notify the NF Service Consumer (i.e. the AMF) by using the HTTP POST method as shown in Figure 5.2.2.4.1-1.\nFigure 5.2.2.4.1-1: Revocation Notification\n1.\tThe NSSAAF shall send a POST request to the revocation notification callback URI, which is either provided by the NF Service Consumer (i.e. the AMF), or retrieved from the AMF profile stored in the NRF (in default notification subscription for \"NSSAA_REVOC_NOTIFICATION\" notification type). If the NF Service Consumer is located in a different PLMN (i.e. the AMF in VPLMN for a roaming UE), the NSSAAF shall use the inter-PLMN callback URI to deliver the notification if the inter-PLMN callback URI is present in the default notification subscription.\nThe content of the POST request shall contain the SliceAuthRevocNotification data structure, within which:\n-\tthe notificationType set to the SliceAuthNotificationType of \"SLICE_REVOCATION\";\n-\tthe gpsi set to the GPSI of the given UE for whom the slice-specific authorization revocation is required;\n-\tthe snssai set to the S-NSSAI for which the slice-specific authorization revocation is required;\n-\tthe supi set to the SUPI of the given UE for whom the slice-specific authorization revocation is required.\nNOTE:\tThe NSSAAF can obtain the SUPI of the UE in the response of a previous Nudm_UECM_Get used by the NSSAAF to retrieve the AMF ID.\n2a.\tOn success, \"204 No Content\" shall be returned and the content of the POST response shall be empty.\nOn receiving the request, the NF Service Consumer (i.e. the AMF) shall revoke the slice-specific authentication and authorization result for the given UE.
